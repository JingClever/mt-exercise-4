The last year I showed this year I showed to show that the glacial heat , which for almost three million years had the size of the United States , a whole thing about 40 percent of the United States continental , it 's refted 40 percent .
But that subjects that underneath gravity because it doesn 't show the spector of the ice .
The arctic calots is , in a sense , the heart of the global climate system .
You can see the winter and you reach .
The next slide is going to be a fast-couple of the last 25 years .
The ice lost has been signed in red .
You can see , you expand to the blue up until the sler .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is summer .
You can see that the cosid-ice , the cosidynames , five years or more , is like blood , that 's like blood , that 's like blood , that 's the blood .
In 25 years , it 's spent by this ,
This is a problem because the whole scale of the whole glaciers around the ocean where there are enormous amount of coal congeled that , sheled up , they 're transformed into microbes .
And I respect to the totality of the atmosphering of global warming , that quantity could double , super-double this point of not .
In some laghi labs in Alaska , the methane is already rebuling from water .
The Katey Walter 's professoresse of Alaska , has been recked with a team , and I took a team taking the winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow ! It 's good . The question is if we 're going to be .
A reason is that this thermal exchange that is that Greenland from the northermal .
This is a glacial river .
The down't ever had to get back similar .
This is the Kangerlusaq , in the west sud-oven Souast West .
If you want to know how the level of the sea level of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice , here is where you get back .
These corrings are going to increase rapidly .
On the other hand , the largest block of the planet .
The last month , the scientists have clearly involved that the ice of the ice of the ice is in negative , and that Antarctica , which poor some submarine islands , which are particularly in the islands .
It 's six feet of the hundred feet , like in Greenland .
Sulla Himalayas , the third biggest block of ice , they see new laghi , that few years ago were glaciers .
40 percent of the world population will be in the water in the sland-water population .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of this city .
The down-up .
But when it decreases , the same happens to the same happens to be pounable .
In California the snow on the Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
Hiximately hycrisis .
The predictions , as you read , are free .
The growth secus in the world leads to a night of the incends .
The environmental disasters are increasing out of the normal and without precedented .
Four times more number in the last 30 years , I think of the precedented 75 .
This is a whole sustainable sustainable .
If you look at it in the stories if they can see the consequences .
In the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 25 million tons of tons of tons in the oceans every day .
Look attently the Eastern Pacific , from the Americas , to the west , and on both wl , and on both the parts of the subcontinent , where there is a radical impoverished oxygen in the oceans .
The major causes of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuel use .
The oil is a problem , and coal is even worse .
The United States are one of the most emissions with China .
And he was proposed to build a lot of coal other central crazy .
But we 're seeing a changing direction .
These are the announced in the last few years and some proposes of alternative ,
Everything is , there 's a political fight in our country .
The coal industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year for promoting coal , which is a oxymold , which is a oxymold .
And that picture me something like --
I 'm going to be a lot of 3.8 billion globe loss of 3.8 billion gloss of coal scories .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second largest flow of scories in America .
It happened around the Natal .
The publicity nature of one of the coal industries was this .
Video : Frosty the carbon , it 's a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
Frosty the carbon is increasingly published .
It 's a good price , adorable , and the workers are keeps .
Al Gore : From here is further of the West Virginia .
The biggest minerary societies is Massey Coal . This is her mountains .
Don Blankenship : Don Blankenship : Al Gore , Nancy Pelose , Harry Rid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alliance for the Clima 's Proteition of Clima has launched two campaiged .
This is a part of them , one part .
Video : Atter : Actually we see climate change as a serious threat the business .
So our priority is to invest a big amount of money in a effort , to make public and confused the truth of carbon truth .
But actually , coal is not sporary .
We think it 's clean , it also has good .
So not preocupateves of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Atter : Carbone -- you 've heard about it .
So let 's take a turn in a turn into the structure that 's about the coal public clean .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noious , but this is the sound of the coal technology of coal coal technology .
The coal consumption is between the main global warming , but the night technology of the coal warming , but the night technology of the cleaning technology .
Date a look . This is the clean technology of the clean technology .
Al Gore : Infinally , the positive alternative connects to the economic security and to the national security .
Video : Coment : America is in the crisis , the national security , the national security crisis .
The flows that all : our dependence that we 're dependence on fossil fuel and oil , the coal and oil .
Now , there is a new , audace solution for use .
Repower of America : 100 percent clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to put the America to work , make sure , make sure , and help stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that you were to solve our problems .
Repower America . Scover more .
Al Gore : That 's the last .
Video : It 's about re-energy in America .
One of the fastest ways to take the dependence on the end of the combustic combustiable that they killed our planet .
What it 's the future is here . I 'm here . Sun , only a new energy network .
What it turns out to two : Novi investment for people to work to be good work .
Comena : Repower America . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old saying , " If you want to go fast , you go down to the fast , go from the money .
If you want to go away , go together . "
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED speckilled a LHC .
And I promise to advance you to add it about how the machine works .
So here I are . And for those that the other time there were no , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever taken -- 27 kilometers of circuit .
His task is to remember the conditions that were present less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
That 's just environment .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
We take these mini-Big mini-Bang inside the detectors .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLATLAS -- it 's a 22 feet . And it has a 22 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions .
Ten September year we have acceserate the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was a huge festilic festery .
It 's a picture of the first of the particles that had done all the LHC , entering into collision , of the LHC , and spread particles in collision , and spread particles in the rely .
In other words , when we saw that picture the 10 of the September , we understand that the machine worked , which is a big victory .
I don 't know if that was this to do exultent us , when someone went to Google and saw that the beginning was this .
That means that we had a cultural impact beyond the scientific impact .
It was a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to these dorated damed here -- these dorated dorated dorated .
These files leaving 13,000 amps when the machine works at the power of power .
Now , the technical technical is to say , " It 's not true . It 's not true . They 're too sotally . "
And they can do that because when they 're very cold slies are very cold dames .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a stand-driver temperature to the space between the stars , these flows can take that corporate that corporate .
In one of the guns of the most noveals in the LHC , there was a fabrication of fabrication .
So the driver standing up slightly , and the 13,000 prints of electrical practices .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnets more than 20 tons than 20 tons , and that they have been moved of about 30 centimeters .
They have damaged about 50 magnetets .
We had to take them , what we did .
We have them and flew them .
They 're back to the way to their place .
I mean , the end of the brush the LHC will be new integrate .
We 'll accening it , and we expect to get this data to july or lights , and we keep so our adventure to find out what the morning of the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents reaccess to the science and engineering value of science and engineering engineering . It 's easy to confutate .
I think that 's so difficult , the fact that it 's so difficult , I think that 's the value of things like LHC .
I 'd like to conclude with the words of a Ingent , Humphrey Davy , which , imagine , in defense of the involved of his puppiler , he was Michael Faraday , said , " Nient is a lot of dangerous , said , " Nient is a very dangerous for the ideas , that are not confidence , and that are not in nature , which are not a concerned , and the square not concerned , and that are not completely new world-new workers . "
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to start to ask you to think about when you 're , you play with the morning .
And as you get to understand how to reach them and get them , and get them and get them , and you learn to think , and you learn to think , and you know , and manipulating relationships .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , from information is inspired by the use of our interaction with physical objects , with the consulting Patts , and my consulting Patts , and I started to ask me , " And if we use a computer , I started to ask me , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only cursor of the digital car , which is going to deal with a desktop , to deal with the manes ,
and to sistemard-like ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the answer , building Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a big interactive computer like a cookied .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a big interactive computer like a cookied .
You can move them with your hand , can see them , you can see , you know their movement and have a screen and a radio radio radio .
But most photos , I 'm physical objects , like the morning , you can move it simply .
Siftable is a new ecosystem of ecosystem to manipulate the digital information .
And as they get more physical , consciously , the other people are movement , the other , and as they become more physics , consciously movement , of the other people like movement , we can explore new and fun new interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurated to show that if it into a direction , the video raised this , if you can figure out the other side .
These interactive ritrats are aware of the other .
If I stros , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they 're surrounded , they can be act a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , they can be act a little bit .
They have been paying their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power of the data , at the data , to give a color like a liquid , like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurated as a secks and I can use them to see color in the central color in the central , where they mised .
and I can use them to put them up to the color in the central , where they mised .
We can get a little bit of it , we can put a little bit back .
You also have a beautiful possibilities of learning , like languages , math and games where people can try to do the fast things fast , and see the results of the results , and see the results results of the immediately .
Now , I 'm now --
This is a Fibonacures that I do with a equations program .
We have a game of words that is half between Scarabeo and Boggle .
By , at every turn a letter to every turn on every turn on every Siftable , Pratically , at every turn a letter on every Siftable , and while certainly certain words of compories .
Then , after about 30 seconds , they remix , and you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
So here 's the children came in the Media Lab , I did to try and put them and spined a video video .
They were very much .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you have to give people many education .
You 've got to say , " Comps of words , " and they know exactly what to do .
That 's here other people who try it .
This is our younger header header , there on the right .
It actually wanted to impilate them .
They were only morning , for him .
Now , this is an interactive cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of the tool of the Lui is Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Siften , they just to be lifted .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Siften , they just to be lifted .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : Sun is similar .
David Merrill : Now he 's taken a treator in the scene .
Video : The arancient treator .
Blab ! Yeah ! Yeah !
So I school , I school the Siftable and put them close can interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
and by inventing their own history .
Video : Hoo !
DM : It 's a wind , and it can decide him how it flew .
DM : It 's a wind , and it can decide him how it flew .
Video : Volkicull .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool , realized of the tool , to walk and execececting music .
It 's a tool , realized , to be recently , to willing and execting music .
Siftable here , they act from sounds like battery , basically , the battery .
Everybody of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also be insert these sounds in a sequence to bug your feeding .
And to move it simply , doing touch a sound , and a sequence .
These are actually that you can control from the vive , like reverbs and the filter .
I 'm attacks to a particular sound , and then including to fill .
And then there are the general effects as time and fly , which applied to the whole sequence .
We look at how it works .
DM : DM : We 're going to put a base in two Siftable Siftable , " we 're going to get it back , we add it to a series , we add other base .
Now I put a bottom line .
DM : DM : Now I add some percussions --
DM : And I 'm going to put the filter , so I can control the battery , so I can control the effect of the view .
DM : DM : DM : I can fly the whole sequence of the time , by one side or the other .
DM : DM : And I 'm going to add the floor to give more expression .
DM : DM : DM : I can recombine the sequence " to the flight . "
So I don 't have to plan it first , but I can improvise it , it 's longer or more cord .
And now , finally , I can spent the whole sequencing the whole sequencing the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is build new multiple machine and more more more more more and more more more more more than our brain work .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this lost , and some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmit is that new generation of the new designed generation of designed objects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world as we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
They 're a writer .
I 'm writing books is my profession , but it 's more than that .
It 's also love and the fascine of my life .
And I don 't expect that can change .
But I said this , something particular happened in my life and my career , which led me to remember the whole thing that led me to recognize the whole work with this .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called " Manogy , Prega , " which , diversity , for some reason , for some reason , some reason that , and it became a big sensational , bestsely .
And the result is that everywhere .
It 's true -- convicted , convicted ,
They are now worried and they say , " Don 't you get more than that ? Don 't do better than that ?
Do you have not fear to keep for all life without power to be able to create a book that can important book that can important someone ? "
What can it important to someone ? "
It 's slightly , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a adolescent adolescent -- I was a writer .
I meet the same reaction based by the same reaction .
And people said , " Don 't temes I didn 't have successful ?
Don 't you fear that the humiliation of the rifted refy ?
Do you have not afraid to do this for all life without the nothing that nothing ever come out and die on a cumodel of drawl , with the mouth of fencing hundreds of failure ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yeah , I 'm afraid of all the things .
I always wild .
And I also fear of many other things that people could not have .
As the alges and other things .
But as I think about writing what I thought and I was wondering , and I was wondering why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's a logical that anyone who has to be spended by a work that you 're born to do .
But what 's there is so particular in the creative impress to make us nervous about health workers in a way that other people do not ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember one in his 40 years of activities where he was asked if he fear to be engineer ?
It wasn 't that -- that block of John , how do it goes ?
Don 't work that , you know ?
Onests , chemical engineers like group don 't certainly have in the centuries , the reputation of being handed maniaci depressants .
We have enough this writers , we have enough this reputation , and not only the creative , but creative of every kind of a kind of stable , we have this reputation of being enormously instable .
And it won 't remaining the dead of the magnificent death of creative creative minds , they died young and often for them .
And the ones that are not suicipate to be real dissatively by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , " Every my book 's book killed me a little more . " Every , extraordinary affermation about work .
But we don 't buy the holding , when we feel that we 've heard these things that in some way we completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are somehow that we have heard and art , at the end , it will be hard to be .
And the question I want to take to everybody is , you 're going to agree with this idea ?
It 's good to you this thing -- because also look at it at a hundred distance to me , it 's not good for anything that supposed .
I think it 's hodiose .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encouraging our big creative minds to live .
And certainly , in my case -- in my situation -- would be very dangerous to start at the heading to the heading heart support , especially to the circuit , especially starting to my career .
That 's really -- you know , I 'm pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I 've got about 40 years .
I still have about four decades workers in me .
And it 's very likely that anything write about now is going to be judated from the world as the work that was going to be judged by my last book book .
I 'm going to slater , because we are all more or less friends here -- is likely that my greatest successful to my shoulder .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start to get a person in the morning nine and I don 't want to do that .
I would like to continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question is , how ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflections , that the way to work to keep writing is to create a psychological cougical costruction , OK ?
I have to find a safety distance of safety , which I 'm writing , and my natural anxiety on which is going to be able to get other side of the year . And , as I was trying to find other company , to look across the time , looking through the time , looking through the time , looking for the societies to see if they could have the best ideas and more snanished .
about how to help creative people manage the risks of creative inherent people of creativity .
And that research has taken me to the ancient Gredivided .
Seguitem because it gets back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity was to believe that creativity was , OK ?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit look divine and he came to the men from a few source source , for reasons and unknown .
The greeignams were spirits of the creativity of the " demons . "
Socrate , wonderful , he believed that was wisdom to have a demon that else wisdom .
Romanufaces were the same idea , but they called that spirit species of spirit .
That 's great , because the Romanime , they didn 't really think that a genius was somebody who was particularly intelligent .
They think a genius was this kind of entities that created a lived kind of lived in the walls of a artist , a little bit like elfentities , a little bit like elfo Dobby , and that came out of treatment and model the outcome of that work and model the outcome of that work .
It 's the distance of -- here is the distance of which I talk about -- that costruction psychological that you 're protective from the results of your work .
And everybody knew that it was so that it worked , right ?
So the anti-protected artists were protected by certain things , like too narcise , right ?
If your work was exceptional work , you could not take the whole , all of the deserve , everybody knew that they were helped by this genius .
If your failed work , it wasn 't all your , right ?
And they all knew that was your genius to be a inable .
And so people han concept creativity in the West for a long time .
Then the Renascivement came and everything changed , and nacked this big idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe , and no longer leaving space of the misters and more and no longer leaving space to be deeply .
This was the rational of human principle and people started to think that creativity was completely by ishared .
And for the first time in the history , you start to refer this or that articulate a genius , rather than a person with the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think that allowing someone , simple person to believe , as a recipient as the source , the essence and the source of all the divines , inconsciously , creative , inconsciously , a huge responsibility to the fragile psyches .
It 's how to ask someone to stay the sun .
Deform and forth the whole ego and creates all these inextable ingerable waitable of the performance .
And I think it was a destroyed pressure the artists in the past 500 years .
And if that 's true , and I think it 's , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understander of the relationship between human and mistery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't cannot be switch 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there is probably people between the audience that would be able to be legitimate , that you can do that they do follow the notion of , you know , you do follow the people to spend up with their projects .
I 'm probably not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I would like to take is -- why not ?
Why not think that way ?
Because it 's more sense of anything that ever ever heard to explain to explain the exaspering imprevebility of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever ever ever loved -- so , basically , everybody here -- it doesn 't buying rationally .
And in fact , sometimes sometimes seem completely paranormal .
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poeteth Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years old , but it was a poeteteth for all life and told me that during her childhood in the Virginia , working out in Virginia , and he felt it was in the rural , and he felt it was in the poem .
And he said it was like a fragorous air of air .
And that was rotate to the landscape .
It was hearing , because he was so much about the land under its feet .
He knew to have one thing to do at that point and it was , words , " run like a math . "
And then it goes back to the home and they were pursuit , and he wouldn 't have to make a piece of paper and a math enough card , while the translated , and he slanded it , and he slanded it on the page .
Sometimes he couldn 't be fastly , so that it running and raise it back and switching up with her and switched her through the landscape , and he would keep rotles through the landscape , and he would keep rotles through the later , looking for how she said , " another poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece I 'm never going to be able to -- there were moments where it was almost losing , okay ?
So , it was running up at home and he was looking for the card and the poem was going through , and he was a match in the way , and then he said , that was like you sleep with the hand and the dought .
And he was poem from the tail and he was put it in his body and transpent it on the page .
And in these cases , poem would be presented on the perfect page and it 's going to be like the last word at the first .
So when I felt it was thinking -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly equal to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a mulo , and my way to work is , you know , you wake up to the same horary every day and go and go and go and go and go up and go up and go up and go up and go up and go and go and go up and go and go and go and go go and go go and go go and go go and go go and go go go and go go and pass to go and go go go and go go and go go go and go go and go and go and go and go go and go and go and pass and go go and go go and go and go and go and go and go go go up and go up and
But even I , in my head , I 've striked against that thing , sometimes .
And I imagine that many of you , the han done .
You know , even if the work and ideas were giving me from a certain source not could honestly be honestly , I could know .
And what is that ?
And how can we relate to it to do that , but rather , rather , rather , that do you get healthy ?
And as I look at it , the best example of the most contemporary example that I have is the Tom Waits , which I interviewed a day in a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of the artest back of the artest towards , trying to control , to manage , dominate these species of creative totally interized creative crafts .
But then I invent , he got calculated , and one day as he was driving on a highway in Los Angeles , he changed everything for him .
It was going to be fast-fast and all of a sent tract of maker , which comes into his head of inspiration , elusive and tracking , and training it , and it wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and it wants , but not as to take it .
It doesn 't have a piece of paper , he has no wouldn 't have a register .
So , starts to feel this kind of old anxiety growing in him like , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm obsessed by this song , lost always .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do . "
And instead of going to go into the panic , they stopped .
And he did the whole process and he did something completely new .
I just look at the sky and said , " Don 't you see that I 'm driving ? "
" Do you know , " Do you know , a song now ?
If you really want to exists , back to a more opporter when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you go to important somebody else today .
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And the process of the process of changed after this .
Not work , the work was still dark like .
But the process , and the fish that was attended it was required when the genius , the genius that was going to see that they were driving it back where they were , and he remaintain it was doing that they didn 't have to be an interiorized , and turn .
but it 's gone to the peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange thing that it was not Tom .
So as I felt that story started changing a little bit even that I worked and already to save me a time .
This idea , I save when I was writing " Manogy , Prega , Ama , " and fall in one of the dycle that we can 't start to think that it will be a disaster , which is going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst that it will be written .
Not just burn , just the worst book .
And I started thinking about gone this project .
But then I remember the Tom that was talking about air and I tried us .
So you zoom in on the end and I recognized my hundred at a vacuum corner .
And I said , " Do you know , " Sends , what do we know if this not will be brilliant book not be interacted my , no ?
Because as you see I 'm put all that I have , not more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to present , you have to present your part .
Okay . But if you do not do it , you know what , I don 't do .
I 'm going to writing the same because it 's my work .
And I would like to make my part of the world today , " Why -- in the end of the end , " Because , it 's so , OK -- in the end of North people damage for the damage of North people raded for damn , damn and music music and hours to the hours .
And they always were magnifices , because the balances were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every once , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually .
And I know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've seen it , at a certain point , a performance that .
It was like the time stopped , and the dance walking through a kind of a bunch of a bunch of a bunch of a tuned , but it all you get dancing .
And suddenly not appeared as a human .
But you get accurated in the fire and under the fire in the fire of the divinity .
And when this was happened , to the time , people knew what was , they called it with her name her name .
They were congible hands and started cantouch , " Allah , Allah , God , " God , " God . "
That 's God , you know .
Curiosa known -- when Ms invader the South of the South , the South of the South , the south of the South of " Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , the role , the role , " which you can still feel in the rate or floor in floor of floor in floor fends .
In Spain , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , " Allah , the word , Allah , magic , good , " incomprehensible , " Really , a scale of God .
And it 's great because we need .
But the problem is the day , the dancing day , the dancing , when you wake up and discover that they 're 11 morning of Martedh and scorce God , there is no longer .
It 's just a mortal with bad for ginoccurred , and maybe it will never be able to take that height .
And maybe no switch the name of God while , and what 's going to do with her life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful recognations to do in a creative life .
But perhaps not need to be so angosh to be so angos , if you can 't believe , mosh , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being from you .
But you just believe that they 're going to you from a further of this squisity of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think it all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly like I thought for several months during the work of the book that I can publishing the dangerous , spent , spacectous , spent , and I was a very successful ,
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel elected by this is , not having afraid .
Don 't just your work . It 's just your work .
Continua present-presented , any part of it can be .
If your work is dancing , ball , ball .
If the divine , absurd genius to leave some kind of wonder , for one moment through your enjoy , for one moment through your effort , then " On ! "
You do , you do the same thing .
And " Oh , " Oh , " I 'm going to the same .
I think there is to teach it .
" On the same , even for you , even for the same , even for a love and headed tals to make you keep present .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I 've talked about some of these projects on the human genome , about what it means and the discovery of new genes .
We 're starting a new pattern : we started to digitalize biology and now from that code code we 're going to the digital code , we 're entering a new phase of biology , designing and synthetic life .
We 've always tried to take big questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists , I think have taken to understand lifting .
We tried different approaches , reducing them to the terms .
We 're digitalized by about 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analogical world of the computer in the digital world .
Now we ask us : we can regenerate life , or create new from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome that can autoreum in laboratory .
And we tried to reduce the ulteriorable genome to create a even smaller .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred gene of the 100-hundred of of the gene here .
But when we look at her metabolic , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
I rededededes , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very improbable that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to provided it was synthesize this chromosome of things to be able to get some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " We can synthetize a cromosome ? "
What can we have these big molecules that we never ever have to create before we could create before ?
And , in case , we can make a cromosome of chromosome ?
A cromosome is simply a piece of chemist material .
The speaker that we 're able to digitalize life is growing to exponential .
Our ability to writing the genetic code , instead of prodiscuss rather slowly , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results that they take it on a exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process requires a lot of pasages , beginning with a bioetic bioetic review before we started .
But we found that synthesize that DNA is very difficult .
There are tentens of thousands of machines in DNA , the longer segments , the letter of 30 to 50 letters and it 's a degenerative process : the segment is more than the segment is the more errors .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these brothers and correct the mistakes .
And this was the first attempt , to start with the digital information of the genome of Phi X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills kills .
We designed the fragments , actually , the correction of errors and get a molecule of DNA , about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemist material , inhert , and we put it into the bacteria , they started reading this genetic code and produce particles .
The viral particles have been required by the cells , are back and destroy and have destroy .
I 've talked about recently with membrals of the oil industry , which they have certainly compress that they have certainly compress this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the biggest things .
We wanted to build the whole cromosome of the bacteria .
They are over 580 miles letters of genetic code .
So we thought that we 've been building it in cassettes of the virus , so that we can change the cassed of the virus to understand what are components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these are to be very accurate .
When we sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 accurately standard was a mile for every 10 miles .
We discovered , resequency , 30 mistakes . If we had been used that original sequence , we would never be able to do that work .
One part of the process is designing over 50 letters that they survive in the 50 letters that are survive with all the other segments of 50 letters to build more tiny undergrounds working together .
We see the only thing here .
You probably have read that we read that we put that on the physical figure out .
Think it like this : we have a genetic code code with four letters : A , C , Gs and T.
Three of those letters together codify about 20 friendly , and there 's a specific order to each minomines .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frames , frames , thoughts .
What we did in the beginning was authographs .
Some have been delivered that it wasn 't poetry .
We designed these segments to just to une them with it .
There are enzymes that are repair .
And we started to assemble of the parts , beginning with segments from five to seven miles , unending up to 72 letters , unended to be a segments of 24 mile letters .
We have these sequen-produced segments in abundance so that we 're trying to create a very very robustood -- as you 'll see a minute .
We 're looking for automatize the process .
So , this seems like the tabellon a basket .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 miles , more 100 miles , they 're not going to grow directly in the E. coli .
You get to the limit of modern tools of modern biology .
So we looked at other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination , which in biology to recombination , that in biology to repair the DNA can undary segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , it can absorb three million radiation .
You can see in the superior as its chromosome of the super-destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled to like before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely separate .
They can live under empty .
They 're absolutely certainly that life exists in space , and you will find new rich environments of water .
And in fact , NASA showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processes , simply using the lif-evidence of the segments that we can put it up .
The least likes them automatically .
This picture was not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope to give it a regular microscope .
It 's a very big molecule that we can see it with a slightly microscope .
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the public that we 've done very few time ago .
They are over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the biggest molecule of a defined structure that we ever created by man .
It 's got a lot of molecular weight to 300 million .
If we stand with a carriers 10 without spaces , you would like 142 pages , you just to transvision this genetic code .
Now , how do we do that ? How can we do that ?
Obviously , you love a virus is a game .
It 's a little more complicated when they use the bacteria use .
It 's easier when it 's about eucariote as we just can just extractly extractly as the nucleus and put another , which is basically the clonation process of clonation .
In the archaea , the archaea is instead is inside the cell , but we have recently demonstrated that we 're able to do a transplant transplant of a cell company of a cell to another and activity it .
We could have a cromosome with a microbial species .
The two are different how the men from the topi .
We 've got some gene more than we could decide what choose for choose for this chromosome .
And then , the slabs with the encies so that we killing all the proteins .
And when we put it into the cell ell was stupending -- and appreciate our sophisticatomic graph -- the new cromosome of cell .
And we started thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we 've tried to spingering over there .
This is one of the most mechanisms of evolution .
We found that lots of species have added to a third romosome of a third romosome of new tracks to that species .
So who think about evolution as only gene to evolution as only gene has no understood for biology .
There are some enabled ency , that is the restription that they 're going to say , DNA .
The cromosome that was in the cells , not have one of them .
The cell phone that we 've got to be inserit-mosome has .
And it 's expressed , and he recognized the other chromosom as a material , and we were returned with only the cell and the new cromosome cell cromosome .
it became blue because of the genes that we 've been insered .
And in a short leaving of time , all the characteristics of a species , and it turns out , and you turn into a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cells .
All the proteins are changed , the membranes are changed , and when we read the equivalent of what we 've been transferred to what we 've been transferred to what we 've been transfer .
Now , this may seem alchemistry , but it can be high the software , we can change things in a very fundamental enough sustained .
Now , I 've already explained that you don 't talk about genesis -- but a progress three million years and a half years of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian explosion .
Why do that ?
I think it 's obvious about our necessities .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half billion in the next 40 years .
Right for example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 , 40 years , there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean water and walking , medicinals and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion billion and a half billion billion and a half billion and a half billion billion and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion billion and a half billion billion people .
It 's going to be more tough to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion baries , more than 30 billion baries of the olio .
That means millions of bariles a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to report them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to keep all the whole emiddle of CO2 from these materials that end in the atmosphere .
And today , because of the scientific discovery in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are designed for the future .
The electronic industry only only only a dozen dozen about components , and think about how many different things came out .
Our limitations are here , basically data from biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have the techniques , because of the rapid methods of synthesization , that can create what we call genomics combinatory genomics .
We 're able to build a big robot that can make a big robot that can make a million cromosomes a day .
Think about that 20 million genes or to try to get the different genes or to try to make optimize or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology molecular molecular , and create more biology , and create more biology , more molecular molecular molecular , and create more molecular molecular molecular , and create more biology .
And it 's simply a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical production , chemical or fuel fuel , production of etc vaccines .
This is an instantanea of some software programmed that we 're working for to be able to seat and design species to the computer .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how they will be .
We know exactly what their gene code code .
We 're now focusing on the fuel of quarter generation .
You 've seen that that extrars from grate was a bad finished experiment .
We have fuel fuel fuel and third generation that will be soon the higher than the higher value to be higher value as optan optan or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without more impact the cost of food and limitate the cost of food and limitate the availability to transform CO2 in matter , so we 're working on to design cells that can reach this discover , and we think we can have this purpose this purpose , and we think we can have the first carbon the same generation in about 18 months .
The sunlight sunlight with CO2 is a metodo-down-driven discoveries around the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the ocean , about 2500 feet of deeply deeply hundreds of water temperature .
They meter from CO2 using CO2 using hydrogen , as a source source of energy .
We 're trying to understand whether we can canallow CO2 , which can easily be transported by tubes , converting that CO2 in fuel , to drive this process .
So short we think that we could be able to increase what the basic question of the basic question , " which is Nice , versus -- we have the mod-a-oil , and we have the gotten industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do that from TED , where can you ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And also , we 're working on using the same methods to create vaccines .
You see this year with influency , we 're always back in a year and a dollar under when it 's a dollar in less .
I think that that we can change building vaccines combines .
That 's how the future could start to look at changing , now , the tree of evolution , acceling the treatment of synthetic bacteria , archy , and finally finally , and finally finally celluence eucariote .
We 're so from the best people .
Our is to do a long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'm going to show you , the most rapidly possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we 've taken to the Microsoft , in the way , exactly a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment that you can interact is local level that remote with a huge amount of data .
We 're seeing here , we 're seeing a lot of digital gabyte with a kind of zoom sting and , for a panoramic sponing , disponing the images how we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these are the big pictures or images .
Most of the photographs , but this is a switches from the Biooowner of Congress , and reached in the city of 300 megapie .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that limit the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not not images .
This is the Dickens of Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
And to show you that it 's about textbook and not images , we can do something like that , to make a real thing to see that it 's a real representation of the text , not a photo , not a photo .
It could be a little artificial to read a little bit of electronic book .
I don 't consider it .
This is a more realistic example . It 's about a The Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and beautiful experience of a card version or a quote version or a quote , which is a lot of a medium .
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of the Guardian .
We created a higher publishing higher solutionary -- much higher than what you use in a normal published -- and we put you inserated that in the extra content .
If you want to see the features of this automobile , you can see it here .
Or other model , or even the specific specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on screen .
We hope that that means to put end up to the pop-up and other porks like the wild , not had to be necessary .
Of course , mapping is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't have contributes to go into this field .
These are all the streets in the United States . It 's a geospatial picture of NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is now actually , actually , from the web ; you can go to see it .
This is a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
A is Seadragon and the other is a visual research an interesting research at Noah Snavority of Washington , with Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve , " optimate . " It 's optima .
And it 's from the web , gesture by Seadragon .
You can see that when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from a picture to the other image and have this kind of experience .
But the spacectively pictures here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization of the computer have registed these images together , so that correspond to real place in real space , so that the images -- all taken up close to the Grassi on Montagne Roccious , that 's been taken . So you see , you know , the elements of a slides , and these things are all colleagues .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some much more spaces .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Nohholds -- and this is from a previous prototype of Photosymptoty-scorsafe -- to show you what I think is really the key scorsafe -- to show you what I think is the key behind this technology , the Photoxietic . And it 's not necessarily evidence that we 've put in the website .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so forth .
This is a reconstruction of the Notre of Dame . Dame pictures from Flickr . Baast to digitar . Baast to digitar , and you get images of types in the maglights , other campus and so on . Onday , one of these conies , the picture is discovery .
So they 're all picked up by Flickr and they were all colleaged to the spaced level in this way .
And it 's possible to be able to navigate this way .
You know , I would never have thought about end to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying to get this kind of accoub here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different types of different kinds of photos : from those of the phones in the LR professional phones , a significant number , to meaning , in this environment .
And if I can , I try to look for those strange .
Many , they 're blocked by faces , etc .
Some of here you find a series of photographs -- here it 's a series of photographs .
This is a poster of Notre Dame registed correctly .
We can go from the poster to the vision of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do with the environment . This is now taking data from the entire memory -- from the whole memory of how the Earth Earth 's perspective , from visual view -- and colleague of all those data together .
All those pictures become linked together , the major of the parts .
You have a model of the Earth 's emerges .
Think about this as a prolungment of Stephen Lawler 's work on Earth virtual Earth .
It 's something that grows as complexity as people do it , and the advantages for who are using the use .
Their picture are marbed with insert meanings with other people .
If someone is the idea of the idea of those data saying the name , my name pictures of Notre of the Comer 's chthedral that 's rich of all of those data , and I can use it as a methaphs of all the data , and I can use it as a methaphs of cross-moed social experience of cross-moed social experience of cross-mobile cross-moed social experience of cross-moed cker .
Of course , a consequence of this are virtual model of any interesting interesting model of the Earth , collective , collective , not only by adown-aellitaries and similar images , but from memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software is going to do is that you can do is that at a point in the next few years , all the photographs , all the photographs shared by anyone in the whole world will be basically colleaged together ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing in practical is discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the basis on the touch of images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of the semantical information that many of these images .
As you make a picture of images on the web , you 're digital , and the text on web page has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what if that pictures you colleague to all your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection and semantic interconnection and the quantity of wealth that is really huge . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure when you travels and one of the delivered of the etnographics of the anti-traditions , between the anti-traditions , between the wind , the wind , touch it in the wind , touch it in the wind , driving in the wind , he 's driving in the plants .
Basti thinking that sciamani Jaguar travel even beyond the Milky , or that the mitites are still a sense of meaning , or Himalayas , Himalayas , the good people , to remember the Dharma of the important of the central anthrowd , to remember the central the major evil model of the sense ,
the result of a particular set of choices that our own stypled , or bad , good , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share the essential tracts .
All of you . We 're all procreating .
We are subjects to be the beginning .
We have to deal the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprise and draw .
We all have an art .
What hits is the particular rhythm of the song , the dance of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they are the Penan 's forests of the Borneo , or the following Voooodoo Haiti , or the Kaisut 's warriers , or a Curandered in Kenya Sahard-.
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a damage of the Qomolangerma , in Everest , the Everest 's mother 's dea month ago .
All these people teaching us that there are other ways of exists of some other ways of thinking , other ways that other mods of model in the world .
And if you think a second , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
Insized , the world cultures of the world creating a ragnature of spiritual life and cultural cultural life that we fly to the planet as the planet as the ragnature of the planet as the ragnature as a biosphere .
And you can think about this ragnature as a cultural ethnosphere and you can define the somal etnosphere , the total , dreams , moved , inspiring , ideas , inspiring , inspiring , inspiration , inspiring , intuitions cared by the knowledge of consciousness .
The etnosphere is the patriage is the patrimony of human .
It 's the symbl of what we are and what we can be as a species as a species .
And because the biosphere was very quickly consumed as it happened to the etnos-nos-nos-hand-dying .
No biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent of all species was on the hord of the species was false , because it 's false -- in the most ophypocalypocalypohypocalypohypohypoetic diversity -- and you don 't even get close to hypothesis , in the most optimistic diversity .
The index of all that is , of course , the linguistic .
When you 're born in 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a vocabulary rules or a series of rules .
A language is the sprackages .
It 's the midddle of every culture is coming in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a switch , a spiritual chance .
And of those 6,000 languages , while we 're sitting in Monterey , at least half , it doesn 't be surprised in the ears of children .
They don 't get more teached to kids , which means , unless you can 't wild something , which are already dead .
What 's more sad than the sad than the silence , of being the last few sad to talk a language , not to have a language , not to have a language of the children ?
This is a floating was the state of someone in the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a living a motor , and it takes in the last syllabe of a ancient language .
And I know somebody who will say , " Isn 't that better ?
The world wouldn 't be better place if we talk all all the same language ? " Bensim , then we talk to all yoruba .
We talk kogs .
You cover a translated thing to what you mean , you can 't talk about your language .
I 'd like to do you a journey through the ethnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosh to give you a tail of what we 're losing .
Many of us forgoes that when I say , " different ways of existing really different ways of existing .
Let 's take for example this Barasana , in Amazon , the sector popular , the population of the anaconda , which crees the myth of the snail of the snap of the snap of the ssnap ,
It 's a popular popular that is not able to distinguish the blue because it 's time it 's identified in time the forest , which depends the popular popular .
They have a strange language and a matrimonic regulated , " of course , " you have to move a person who talk about different language .
All that radical in the past , but the particularly , the particularity is that in these families that are talking about six or seven language because of matrimons of matrimons .
They 're limited to listen to listen to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribe about the most of the most interesting tribe , the Waorani Waorani , a popular that has been the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have taken a commercial missionary .
They did taken from the high-dimensional photographed them in a few of adichevoles , forgotting that this popular population had never seen bi-dimensional forest .
They 've been raised the ground of the Earth , they spines the research of a shape and , not find nothing , they have concluded that they were treated that they were killed to the five missionarious with the lance .
But the Waorani doesn 't just killed the strangers .
They killed to kill them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by the same .
We 're rising high high holds and we found two cases of natural death and when we stayed to know , they 've been invited to know , they were aging that died so they died , and then they killed it the same . [ Really , they had a very incredible knowledamn of forest .
The crawers were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the first 1980s , I was assigned a very interesting tassigned when my Harvard professor was asked if I wanted to go to Haiti to intruly intruly , the base of Duvalier , and impossessing me of the speak of the Duvalier 's used to make zombie zombie zombie .
To give a sense of miraculous , I would have to understand the Vodoun culture culture and that Vodoul is not magnical .
It 's pretty much about a complex metaphysical view of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianesimum , Islam , Budddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has not religious lifetime . And instead of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these very profound religious concepts of slavery .
What makes the interesting voodoo is the relationship between life and death .
So , you know , the spirits .
The spirits can be invocated by the Great the Great , they resple to the dance of dance and replace to replace the soul of the view of the way that for a short bad across the goal .
So , the voodooists say , " You know , white white , you know , God talk about .
We say in the temple and diventiate God . "
And from the moment that you 're sitting , is the spirit that you 're driving you , how can you do that ?
So you 're going to these incredible events . And you would be following voodoo states in the state of trance that touch a rather demonstration rather than the body 's mind when it 's catalyed in a state of extreme extreme , when it 's catalyed in extreme state .
And in all the people with which I lived the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada Kogi , the Kogi Marta , the Santa Marta , Colombia sector sector .
Deign the ancient civilization that once lived on the load planets of Colombic planes in the conquister , the popular population , population population was on the vulcanic massive plugger .
In a mackrowded of blood , this popular never been conquisted by the spending spending .
But they are today from a clero , but their formation is decisionally extraordinary .
The young people are taken by the families to three or four , and live secregated in a world , and they live secregated in a world , and homs in a good world , and they live in the glacier for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , to reproduce the nine months of the gestation that spring in the user of the gestation , are now metaphorically in the Great Mother .
So , for all this time , they 're acculturated to the values of their societies , values that are predict to their predict , they keep the cosmic balance -- or to say the better , balance .
At term that incredible began , they 're improviously taken out and for the first time in life , at 18 years , they see a high-high . And in that account of the first baby , when the sun of beautiful landscape , when the beautiful beautiful valley , everything they learned in theory , it 's a step back . The prete does a step back . The preciated behind . The prete behind a step back . The prete behind of the size , when they 're wrong , and he 's been been been been been been been been been been improvisudriving , and he 's been been takilled back of
" Do you be like , you know .
It 's amazing . It 's now to you protect it . "
They 're called called the most of the most and say that we , brothers , brothers are the colputs of the world .
This level is intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the Ingene and the environment , we 're invoice Resian , and the old story of the noble self-vages , which is a razy , or perhaps invote , or perhaps invote and say that these populations are closer to the Earth of us .
The Ingenius are not feedal , or undes indebulites from nostalogy .
There is no space for these things in the malic paluds of the Aststoppt , but because of the Tibet , but because of the time and the returns , they created a mystical measures of the Earth 's knowledge , but on a bigger neighbors . But on a bigger , the concept that the Earth can only live is only unknowledge , because it 's a very infection that the Earth can only be under concerned .
What does that mean ?
It means that a kid of Ande that grow , which is a munder , and it 's a spirit . Apu that mountain is a destiny different , and it 's going to have a deep different deeply different relationship and it will have a fun with the mountain or that place . And it 's a kid , which is a male of Montana .
That 's the dimora of a spirit or a mineral , or a mineral .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defining the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the British Columbia creating that forests served that forests served to be cut .
And that made me a human being in the Kwakiutl that believe that the forests are the Hukuk dimate that forests are the Hukuk and the down-short , and the dogs that live in the last north of the world , spirits that live in the world , spirits that are dealing during the Hamator .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of their sensitive discoveries . We take this plants .
I took this picture to open in the northern Amazon the north-doctor .
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayahuash of the psychoactive repertoilet 's the sciamanic repertoilet 's the sciamanic repertoilet .
What makes the ayahuashuasis not the dangerous potential of the sustainance , but her elaboration . It 's composed to two elements .
From a side , this liana legnose that contains a series of betacarboline , harmine and moles , slightly hallucinogens .
You can take the only plant is a blue smoke that up a little blue that up a little bit of consciousness , but it 's michoice with the dy-Actually , the Psychotridis .
This plant contains powerful triptamines , very similar to serotonin the methoxyltryltryltryltryptamine-thoxyltryltryltryltryltryptamine-ptamine-ptamine-ptamine-ptamine-package .
If you ever see Yanomami . It 's taking the nose of the sustainance that they do a different set of species , anched methoxyltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryptamine .
And so , polar that wap on the nose is like being disappeared by a bunch of paintings and land on a mate batch of electricity . It doesn 't believe that reality . It 's not creates a destortion of reality .
I often I often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who walked the psychedelic , with his discovery of the fungi in Mexico .
I think I think I can 't be able to be classifying these tripamines like hallucinogens because if you can 't tell any one of being honed . Can unaminated . And the triployed , they can 't be horally because they 're money from a supply in , detected , because they are a very , in the inexists , detailed by a monoxinossifically .
It 's possible to absumerely if you 're just a little bit of summer , denaturate the MAO .
Now it 's the beautiful : beta-carboline that are in this liana of MAO , the same kind of MAO , the same kind of necessary to be necessary to be able to be triptamines . The question spontaneous surface : in a free 80,000 species of plants , like these popular population , but if you combine in this way , create a biochemical version that is summmmate the sommma of parts ?
We use the great euliar eur of evidence and error , which can be infruit .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " The plants talk about it . "
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuash , which are unguy in the forest , and that our eyes will be going to be in the same species .
If we ask them how they are they going to be . " I thought about plants , " I thought about plants , " I didn 't know about plants , you don 't know . "
The solution is : you take 17 variety in a night of len and each night with a different dinner , and each other .
With this is not a Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that to contate the stams .
Now , the problem is that even that the problem is that even the people who have heart the ingenes that have heart populations , but in some redoctors in the history of the real world , and pass beyond the real world , and pass .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it will not remember for his wars or its innovations , but rather like the era that we were stopped and we have been used to actively or accepted destruction of diversity diversity and cultural diversity of diversity of biological diversity and cultural cultural diversity of the planet . Now the problem is not the remember of the planet .
All cultures through the secoli have been involved in a dance for new chance of life .
And the problem isn 't technology .
The Indians didn 't stopped to be Sioux when they put out of a horse , when they put out of Americans , they don 't stopped to be Americans when they put out of a horse and calved .
It 's not the change or the technology that thnosal integrity . It 's the power .
The face of domination .
And if you look at the world , you 'll find that these are not cultures that these are not cultures cultures .
They are living and dynamics and dynamics , dynamics outside the existence that go beyond their ability to adaptation .
And what you have disboxes in the Penan Patrian of the Penan --
a popular popular no-made , in Southeast , in the Souast , a popular popular popular , and now re-prostitution to the service , and now reduced to the services of the rive revolved , where you can see the Really , where you can see the floor of the MIIIIMar CBorneo , where the navels , where the navi hills ,
To take the standing stand the standing of the forest .
Or in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that are the disease that have come with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on the mountains of the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard domination of political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physics of a popular popular , is convicted to universal level , but the destruction of the destruction of the lifestyle , the destruction of the lifestyle , not only is condition , but they 're telling for the strategy , because it 's part of the strategy development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet , until you 're part of the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in the West Cina through the Tibet South Eastern , coming to Lhasa with a young , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what we have behind is that statistics .
6,000 sacred monuments in the wild and fill .
1.2 million people killed by the military military during the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical to the Panchen Lama .
That means that it was killed to the time of Chinese invasion .
His uncle floor is flew with Santity during the diaspora that led the popular in Nepal .
His mother was impresed and her colcolor was rich .
It was taken about the age of two years , born under his gonna because he could not live under his leg because he could not live without his hond .
And the sister , who did the same , was in the field of reeducation .
One day he has been walked a day , a day , a danger , and for this transgression , was mitted to the work , was put the workers for seven years .
The pain the Tibet can be insopurable , but the spirit of the population is from the present .
And then , all , all reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the world of the monotony or we want to take the policy-the-flip world ?
The great anthropologa Margaret Mead , before he said her the greatest fear was that , in our biggest fear of the world , we 'll see the whole gamm of human imagination , not only see the whole gamm of human imagination , but one day we 'll be swake up from a sonn .
And it 's umiliating that our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Neolitic Rivolution , who given us the agriculture , which did measure us to the cult of the seed , they replace the poem of the sler of the sler of the sler of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has 300 years .
That whatever whatever , not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal with the millennia to come .
When these sort of cultures of the world is asked what it means to be human , they say to be human , they say with 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all risky the possibility of being what we are : a species that we are knowledge , that has to make all the people and all the gardins can floor . And there are great moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the northern of the island of Baffin , when I went to hunt of the Balin the Inuit , Olaya , Olaya , he told me the wonderful story of her grandfather .
The canaw government was not always gentle with the Inuit and in the 1950s to stabilist , we have rinkered them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , teaching for his life , and took him all the arms , and all his attacks .
You need to know that Inuit doesn 't have the cold , the frequency , exploit .
The batts of the sleeps in origin of cartos .
The grandfather than this man didn 't intimise from the arctic night or the library .
It 's gathered out , it 's hot the skin in skin in skin and focused in your hand . When I did the tiny . When I did you have been congelated , they 've been working on a lama .
He spred on the points of this colder , and when they became solid , he killed a dog .
He showed the dog and created a brid , with the house cash of the house , he had a sleeped , he imbrought another dog , and it 's disappeared on the banker ,
We want to talk about cavarsely with nothing ? [ Rism ] And this , in different ways , [ Apausi ] is the symbl of the resilience of the Inuit of the world 's populations .
In the 1999 the canaw government that 's reached the total Inuit 's total control of a larger area of the larger California and the Texas the together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's an independent territory . They 're all the minerary resources .
One splendo about how a natione-state can remember with his popular .
And , to finish , I think it 's quite obvious at least at the one of us was in these zones of the planet , to make concerned that they 're not remote .
For someone is home .
They represent sections of human imagination that are treating at the high of the days . And for us all , the dreams of these kids , like dreams of the hope .
And to finish , we have National Geographic , we convinced that politicians will never get to nothing .
We think polemiics --
[ Applausi ] not are persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the world , perhaps the best institution to tell the world . Each our site is about 35 million visitors .
156 countries transmit our television canal canal .
Our resourts of millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the etnos-based , in place of wonderful cultural diversity , where they 're going to go away from how they 're going to see , hopefully , braced up for the central reve-exists of the anthropology : the world 's world 's deserved in a pluralistic pluraly of life in a world and multicultural world
where the wisdom of all the people can contributing to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some of the things that I wrote in this book that I hope you 've already heard and proverse to evidence some of links , in the notakes notained them .
I want to start with what I call " the dogma dogma official . "
The official dogma official dogma dogma .
The official dogma dogma of all the Western industrial dogma is furniture : " If we want to massive as a citizens . " The way to do it is massive freedom . "
The reason is , from a side , in the fact that freedom is in the same value , is precious , useful , behavior , the essential for human beings .
And the other one is that if we 're free , each of us can act for all that we can do for all that massive , without any decided in name .
The way to massive freedom is massive freedom .
More choice , the people have , more than they are free , and more than their liberty , the major well-being .
This , I think , it 's so deeply radicated in societies that no one would dream to put it in doubt .
And it 's also deeply radical in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress can be .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I permission to me a simple note about conditiments .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without content 10 variety of oil and 12 acetes and 12 acetes huge , which you can buy for you a huge number of conditions in the field circuit that ners are already to be your degree .
That 's what supermarket is supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic negotie : CD , lector , radio , lector , radio , radio , radio , plaaaaaaaaaleft , practical .
And in this single negoties of electronics , there 's a big number of components .
We can do six million and a half million different combinations using the components that there are only in a only negoties in .
We need to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Other the switches : the world of communications .
I once a child , when I was a child , you could get all the phone services , and it was brought by mom Bell .
You were explained the phone , you wouldn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , between the phone , was that the telephone .
These days went .
We have a variety of phones , especially between the phones .
Here 's the cell of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , tackage , and foreign for the crack , and foreign to the crisk .
If you don 't even see it in the negotie under home , you 're going to soon .
And what happens is that people enters in the negoties and he 's got this question . And you know , you know , " that 's the answer ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the buists , you true the same choice .
Assistency , healthcare : it doesn 't happen in the United States that you go from the doctor and doctor , what you need to do .
Instead , I go from the doctor , and doctor says , " Okay , we could do A , or B , " A " A has these benefits and these " B benefits . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Dr. What would I have I should do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , and B has these benefits and these benefits . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you can stand , " Dr. What would you be me , what would do ? "
And the doctor , " But I 'm not her . "
The result of the result of the malate , expression that makes it seem to be good thing .
But it 's actually not that a move the weight and responsibility of taking some decisions that something knows the doctor , to somebody else -- and almost certainly maled -- and almost certainly maled -- and so not in the ideal condition to take the patient decisions that patient .
There 's a huge marketing of drug products , direct people like me and you , and if you think , it 's no sense , because there 's no sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why they publishing them ?
The answer is that they want doctor to ask them to ask us to change the recipe the recipe .
Something that fundamental as it is our identity is a question of choice , how you see in this vigness , " We don 't want to force children to take children . They don 't want to be a identity . " We don 't have a identity : we need to invent .
And we can reinvent how many times us .
That means that every morning , at the morning , you have to decide that kind of person wants to be .
And I 'm going to look at the family and marriage , a time time , communal perspective , under the time , was that you can move the most soon as possible , and he was beginning to make the most possible possible possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and even when , and not even what to do after .
And it 's really to play .
I teach students very smart , and I do have been in less than I work to be a time .
And not because they 're less bright , because they 're not unless diligent .
But why are I impensionally , I 'm asking to ask , " Would I wish to spoke me or not ? Would I do that now ? "
" Would I be smart ? I have to think before or the career ? "
They are logoring interrogorange .
And they look for answer these questions , even if this implies , that it doesn 't completely to get the tasks and not get a beautiful vote to my exament .
And they really have to do that . They are important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , as Carl underlucky , because it allows us to work every day , every single day , every corner of the planet , from Hotel Randolds .
And so on the parently , there 's a corner , and I 'm not going to tell you where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What means , this incredible freedom freedom of choice that we have about work ? It 's that we have to keep , at every moment , if we need to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing warm , with the cell phone in a tax , Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook , typically , typically , on the knees .
And even though they are all spent , every minute that we see our boy , we 're also asking the game , " Do I have to say , " Do I have to say , " Do you say , " I have to say , " Do I have to say , " Do you know , we 're also asking the game , " I have to say , " I have to say
" I have to say that email ? I have to habboard ? "
And even when the answer is " no , this makes the experience of your child , very different than your son 's son , very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the things , we look at the small , and large things , the life is a question of choice .
Once the world was this : Overs , there were some possibilities , but not all that was a choice of choice .
The world today looks like this : The dilemma is , " Isn it 's a good thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Shundred .
We all sorts of the slives . So I 'm going to talk about the negative ones .
All this choice two effects two negative effects on people .
The first one , paradoxally , is that it produces instead of liberation .
With the options of which choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I offer you a meaning : a conducted study conducted on flip .
A colleagues had access to the Vanch data , the gigantic fundamental fundamental funding , with about a million clients of the companies of 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 sours , there 's 10 percent of adesions , at less than the respect to when they are available only five . Why ?
Because with 50 sours of the dying , it 's maledly difficult to decide , and choice is remainly difficult to inmorrow .
And I still ask , and again , questions , questions , tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow .
You know that it doesn 't only means that these workers are going to mangerate food for cans because they 're not going to have enough money , it also means that decision is that they lose the fundamental fundamental fund complementary complementary the dator of the work .
It won 't participating , they 're losing to five dollars from the dator of work , which would be behind to true them .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world .
" And finally , for eternity : ketchup , ketchchup ? "
You want to take the decision , if it 's for eternity , isn 't it ?
You don 't want to choose the slate , and you don 't want to choose back .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoid the paralysis , and we 're going to be at the end , unless options from the result of how we would be with less options of the outcome of how we would be with less options of them .
And that 's for several reasons .
One of these is that with many conditivegetables , if you buy a lot of them , and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that would be better . And what 's going on is that alternative imagined us industry , and the report died the suddenly , the diminusual re-recognize the decision ,
And when it was a good decision .
More choice are , the easier is easy to dispilevered any detail that 's insod-dispiece of choice .
And there is what economists call constood .
Dan Gilbert asked very well as a value that we can do the value that we can depends on what we are confrontiers .
And in the rest , when there are so many options , it 's easy to be able to represent the extent of the option that options of the option that option that option is choice .
So , here 's an example . I school with all the people who are not New York .
But that 's what you probably think .
There is this couple in the Hamptons .
A place of luses .
It 's splenda . It 's been days . It 's all about it .
Nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , malth , it 's Augo-up . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan are forth . "
" I could talk about front of home . "
And it spent two weeks , from the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The constood is decreases the satisfaction for what we have , even when choice was an excellent .
And the more than the options that we have to look at , the more the characteristics to be back to us as constantly constood as constood .
Here 's another example .
This vigness tells us a lot of things .
It talks about living the moment , and maybe the living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you choose to do , you know , you choose to do not do other .
The things that we don 't choose to attract tactive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : it 's growing the expectations .
I tried it on my skin beating a new couple of jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
And once the jeans were only like , buy them and buy them and dress from bestivestiated , they were dissimulated , just after having a lot of times , they started to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple when the old old were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The commit said , " Do slim , he wants to me , he relaxy fit ? "
Do you want to the cernight-buttons ? " Stonewashed , or " ached " ? "
" Do you want to be stricked ? "
" Sotto them , you know , or hundred holding them , " Continuate elen-up .
I was slying , and after a while I was able to say , " I want the guy that was the only like , " I want to say , " I want to know what it was , so for a hour jeans , I went out of the eans , jeans , and then the best couple of jeans that ever had .
It was the massive . And all that choice had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice , with all that choice , jeans had to be perfect .
I was waiting for me . I won 't expected anything excited when he was only a kind of a kind of a kind of , but when he saw 100 different , fun , at least a kind of had to be perfect .
What I was bought was good , but not perfect .
After I had compared that choice with what I was trying to be involume in compared to expectations .
The addition of options in life of people don 't do that to increase the expectations that have respect to the options of the options of the same .
And this will be less satisfy , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing if they realized it .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth more like this .
" You 'd be better when you were worse , " The reason you were better when he was worse is that when he was worse , when he was worse he had worse , you can meet .
And the world , in the world that we live in -- opulents , industrialized citizens with the expectancy of the perfeature -- the massive of the aspectations are at the high-aspectations .
You never surprised because your expectations , because your expectations expectations , you have ingigantic .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse waitable . "
I mean , a little autobiographic modity -- which I 'm really married and my wife is really stupid .
I could not do better , I didn 't have accounted .
But that 's not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of the comprate a couple of jeans when there is only that when you 're not satisfied , and you ask you , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " And the answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a insection , and you ask you who is the responsible , it 's the responsible , it 's as clear that responsible is you .
You could have been doing better .
With hundreds of available variety , there are no fresh for insuccessful .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is the result is , they 're going to be walking , and give the cols to the same .
In the last few years , depression is exploded in the last few years .
I think a meaning factor -- not the only , but important -- of this depression of the depression of the depression of the depression of people because standards are too high high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that colors are .
So the end result is that we 're in general , we 're better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember that you remember .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not true .
There is no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than haven 't at at that but from this is not at a little choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been superted by a piece of the level where the choice better than the lives .
Now , from the political point of view -- I almost finished -- from political point of view , the nocity is the following .
What allows that all this choice in the industrial societies is material .
There are many places in the world , and you have been knowledge about that , where the problem isn 't that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too a few too pop .
So the face of the face that I 'm talking about is a sick of modern modern , recognize societies .
And what it does to have to be this : Steve Levitt talked about how much those constood and discovered to you about how those cocobic cobic cobic cobird . It 's a sprary money .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dious , it 's not just inuseful .
They are addictated of the eteries .
They 're worse .
If a little bit of what in our societies allots of choice was reverse in those where people have too poorous , it would be better than only , it would be improve , but our our our lives improve , but our our our .
This is what economists call a paretian improvement .
A redistribution of the refined is good at all -- not only the poor -- because of this choice in a way that you go back .
And to conclude , " Fild , you can be what you want , "
You know , people of culture , you think , " What does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get it into a glass . "
" A castrated imagination , a limited view of the world , "
and that 's what I 've interpreted it , at the beginning .
But then , think , instead , I realized that fish the heavy knows that the long knows .
Because the real thing is that if you 're sent to mand the bocks , so that " all you can 't get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the boat so that everything can diminuliitous satisfy .
You 're going to take the paralysis , and you 'll reduce the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost of course too , too , maybe even fish for fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic sphere is a rich for inficity and , for roine .
Thank you very much heart .
