The last year I showed these slides to demonstrate that the glacial calots , which for almost three million years had the United States , for almost three million years had the United States continental , and refted over 40 percent .
However , this subjects , because it doesn 't show the splanding of the ice .
The glacial calots is , in a sense , in a sense , the heart of the global climate system .
You can see the winter and you reverse summer .
The next slide is going to be a quick carlay on the last 25 years .
The ice lost lost are signed in red .
And as you see , they expanded up to the blue .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is summer .
You can see that the ice , the ice gap , five years or more , is like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood ,
In 25 years , it 's spent from so ,
This is a problem because the warming is the interest in the glacier around the ocean , where there are huge amount of coal coal that , the shake , the wind microbes .
I 'm going to do that totality of global atmospheric redouble , that quantity might double , superty this stage .
In some recently deep in Alaska , the metane is already rebullating from the water .
The professoresse Katey Walter of Alaska University of Alaska , and we got a team taken a team took a team .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore is good . The question is if we 're going to be it .
A reason is that this termal exchange is that this thrimp from the northern .
This is a glacial river .
The House had never reached levels .
This is the Kangerlusaq , in the South west of Greenland .
If you want to know how to be the sea level of the ice , to sea level of the ice , here is where it reaches the sea .
These corrings are increasing rapidly .
At the other side of the planet : Antarcttarm of the planet .
The last month last month have clear scientists have been talance , and that Antarcttared , and that Antarctarcttarly in the islands , which is particularly quickly rapid , is particularly quickly in the sheer .
It 's six feet of the high himself , like Greenland .
On Himalayas , the third biggest block , you see new lay , which is a few years ago , who were glacier .
40 percent of the world population was half of the world 's powering water from the slightly hard .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the city of this city .
The ported led it increased .
But when it decreases , the same happens to the powerful water .
In California , the snow on the Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The backls are in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , are graves .
The increasingly city in the world leads to a remarkable increasing remarkable .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm out of the normal and without precedental .
Four times more numerous times in the last 30 years than previous 75 .
This is a whole thing that is unsustainable .
If you look at it in the historical context if they can see the consequences .
In the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look attention the East area of Pacific , you give the Americas , obviously , the west , and on both the parts of the section of the indian exing of the ocean .
The major causes of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent of them , is the fossil fuels .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And he proposed to build a lot of coal other central central .
But we 're seeing a change of direction .
These are the annolated projects in the last few years and some proposes of alternative proposes .
Everything , there 's a politics in our country .
The coal industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year for promoting coal , which is a clean oxymer , which is a oxymold .
And I remember that picture was going to --
I 'm Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion gallers of coal gallers .
Maybe you 've seen it on the news .
This is the second largest flow of scories in America .
It happened around the Natal .
The natalize natalize of one of the coal industries was this .
Video : Siddye , it 's a pleger and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it will grow our economy .
Frosty carbon is more and more public .
It 's a good price , adorable and workers and workers keep the style .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest ministrator society is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : : I 'll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they know about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima Protection launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Atter : All COALergy see the climate change as a threat to our business .
So , our priority is investing a great amount of money in a effort to a very advertising to a public and confused the truth .
In fact , coal is not sports .
We think it 's cleaning it . It also 's a good , we can .
So not preoentertainment of climate change .
Let 's do to us .
Video : Carbone : Carbone -- you 've heard a lot of it .
So let 's take a turn in a turn in a structure of the clean , for how much about coal .
Stratratraordinary ! The machines are a little noiss , but that 's the sound of the technology of clean .
The coal consumption is between master cutters of global warming , but the remarkable technology that you see changes everything .
Let 's look at a look . This is the technology of clean technology .
Al Gore : Al Gore , the positive alternative is connects to the economic security and national security .
Video : Coming : The America is in the crisis , the national security , national security ,
The row that the line that all of us : our dependence on fossil fuels , like coal coal and oil .
Now , but , there 's a new audace solution for use .
Repower America : 100 percent of clean energy in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work , make sure , and make sure , to help us stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that you 're going to solve our problems .
Repower America . It 's more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Coming : It 's about re-energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to bring up to the dependence on combustible that killed the planet .
What 's the future is here . I 'm going to be . It 's one , a new energy network .
What it turns out to be able to do is remarkable for work .
Coming : Repower America . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old african a-proverbial African says , " If you want to go to the fast ,
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED I did an introduction on the LHC .
And I promise to return to the nice on how the car works .
So , here I am . And for the other time , there were no LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever -- 27 miles of circumference .
His to remember the conditions that were less than a billion second , by the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
Everything is just environtious .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
We spent these mini-Bang Bang in the remarkers .
This is what I work on . It 's called ATLAS -- it 's 44 feet and has a gone of 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportion .
10 September year we have accesuaces the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was causes immense to control in the room .
It 's a picture of the first particles that had done all the around the LHC , entering in collision , by a part of the LHC , and spreading particles within the remarker .
In other words , when we see that picture 10 , we see that the machine , we understand that the machine worked , which is a big victory .
I don 't know if that was this to be to do more or more , this , when someone went on Google and saw that the initial page was this .
What we mean that we had a cultural impact on beyond that scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to just these dored dored .
These right-thousand amping 13,000 amps when the machine works at the power of .
Now , the technicians between you will look at the children and say , " It 's not true . I 'm too much . I 'm too much . "
And instead can do that when they 're very cold dages become cool the superconditions .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a under the inferior at the star of the space between the stars , these falling crowd that .
In one of the guntures between the magnetic magnetic magnetic record , there was a fabrication of fabrication .
So the flowers rewarming slightly , and the 13,000 amps suddenly met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnets have more than 20 tons , and that have moved about 30 centimeters .
They 're going to be about 50 magnetic .
We had to take them , what we did .
We 've got them and restined and restined .
Now they 're all back to their place on the ground .
I mean , the LHC will be again , the LHC will be again .
We 'll accening it , and we expect to achieve the data to jumping or lights , and we continue so our adventure to find out what the morning .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents reaccess to the debate on the value of science and engineering in frontier . It 's easy to confuture .
I think that 's so difficult , the fact that it 's so difficult , I think it 's value of things like LHC .
I 'd like to end with the words of a Ingan scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I imagine , in defense , which , imagine , in defense , his puppiler was Michael Faraday , said , " Nithing is so dangerous for the progress of human mind , how to think about the ideas of are definitive , which is not in nature , that there are not a new worlds , and that there are not in the new words , and that are not in the new words , and that there are not in the way to be . "
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink about when children , from children , played with the morning .
As you get to realize how to reach them , and you get them and move them , and you learn to think and solving problems , and you can solve problems and manipulating relationships .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , as a computer inspired by the use of our physical interaction with physical objects , and my consulting Patts , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asked , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only cursor a digital polluter , which is going on a desktop of a digital pollutal feels ,
and it 's our pleasiment ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a big interactive computer like a bird .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a big interactive computer like a bird .
You can see them moving with your hand , they can see , " in their own , to hear their motion and they have a radio and a wireless and a wireless radio .
But most of them , I 'm physical objects , like the moronces , you can just move it to just fit .
The Siftable is a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physicists , consciously consciously , the other , and as as they become more physicists , consciously , of how we move , we can explore new and fun and fun interaction .
I 'll start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurated to show the video : if it 's in a direction , the video is going to run up like this , if you including back .
These interactive ritrats are consciously aware of other .
If I love them , they 're interested in what 's going on .
If they come around , they can see it and they can be like a little bit .
If they come around , they can see it and they can be like a little bit .
They also have a lot of their motion and inclination .
We realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power that we could use common data , for example , " to fall like a liquid , like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable as a seck of vernice and I can use them to put them in the central color in that central , where you mixing .
and I can use them to fall the color in the central , where you mix .
We can put too much , we can put a little bit a little bit .
I 'm also a beautiful possibility of learning , like languages , mathematics and games where people can try to try to do the faster , and see the immediately results .
Now , I 'm --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that 's half in half and Boggle .
Basically , at every turn a letter to a letter on every Siftable , Pratically , at every turn a letter to every turn a letter on every turn on every Siftable , and while you 're trying to understand words control about a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds remissing , and you have a new set of letters and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came to the Media Lab , I did so that they tried them and turned a video video .
They 're very much like they were loved .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people many education .
You 've only got to say , " What I want to do . "
Here 's how other people that try it .
This is our younger header than there .
It actually wanted to just improved them .
They were only in the morning , for him .
Now , this is a carton of a carton .
We wanted to build a tool for the languages for languages .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving the Siftable , they can put them .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving the Siftable , they can put them .
And that 's doing that , he 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is sungaries .
David Merrill : Now he took a treator in the scene .
Video : The arancient tractor .
By ! Yeah !
So I school at Siftable and put them closer can make the neighbors --
Video : Bau !
and by making their own story .
Video : Hoo !
DM : It 's a story with the open final story , and it can decide him how to do it .
DM : It 's a story with the open final story , and it can decide him how to do it .
Video : Voly , guns .
DM : The last example I 've got time to show you a tool , realized , to walk up and exececuts music .
It 's a tool , recently , to walk and executting music .
The Siftable here , they get from sound like battery , based and the battery .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also insert these sound sound to be able to buy your pleasure .
And it just modify to touch a sound and a sequence .
These are effects that you can control from the alive , like reverse and filter .
I 'm going to a particular sound and then including it .
And then there are the general effects as time and fly , which is to apply to the whole sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : DM : We 'll start putting a base in two Siftable , " sequence " , " We 're going to get them in a series , we add other base .
Now I put a line of low low .
Video : DM : I add some percussions --
Video : And now I 'll put the battery filter , so I can control the effect from the alive .
Video : DM : I can fly quickly the entire sequence inclinking time from one side or another .
Video : And I 'll just just add the filter to the low low to expression .
Video : DM : I can recombine the sequence " to fly "
So I don 't have to plan it first , but I can improvisate , and it 's more shorter or more short .
And now , finally , I can smoke the entire sequence inclinking to the left Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new murdering mate new mut-machine and more like how our brain work .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this performing , and also a few possibilities that we 're trying to bring out from the lab .
The concept I want to turn is that new generation is coming this new generation of designed objects to interacting with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a written .
I 'm writing books , it 's more than that , but it 's more than that ,
It 's also the love and the love of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , I said this , something particular happened in my life and my career , who took me to realibrate the entire realibrate with this job .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called " Mangia , Prega , Ama , " which , " which , diversity , for some reason , for some reason that , and it became a big sensationship , and became a big sensationship .
And the result is that everywhere go , people go , people who treat me as if I was convicted .
It 's true -- convicted , convicted .
They 're going to be worried about now and they say , " Don 't you fear to do better ?
You don 't fear to keep writing all life without getting more able to create a book that can important to someone ? "
what can it important to someone ?
It 's rassumer , you know .
But it could go worse , part of that I remember 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent adolescent -- I was a writer .
I meet in the same reaction based on fear .
And people say , " Don 't throw me not to be able to succeed ?
Don 't you fear that the humiliation killed ?
You 're not afrants to do this for all life without that nothing is ever outside and die on a cumulate of dying , with the dinfrants with the dinner douth of fallish fallish ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I 'm afraid of all of these things .
I 've always had afraid .
And I also fear of many other things that people can 't have to guess .
As the high and other things .
But , how about the one I thought , and I was going to be a latest ?
Is it rational ?
It 's a logical that everyone wait to be spaved by a job that it 's been born to do .
But what is there so particular in the impress of creative entries to the health care about the health health and mental to a way that other people do not do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemist engineer and I don 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he fear to be engineer ?
It never was -- that 's never to -- that block of the engineer John , how is it ?
It didn 't work like that , you know ?
Onestically , chemistry chemistry as group , in the centuries , the reputation of being alcooker .
We have a writers , we have enough enough this , and not only the creative , but creative of every gender , we have this reputation of being enormously instable mentally .
And I don 't think about what you 're looking at the boundary death of the creative minds that , only in the 21st century , they died young and often for them .
And the ones who are not suicipate they look at being actually dissatisfacts .
Norman Mailer , before he died in the last interview , he said , " Every my book book book killed a little more " . " A extraordinary affermation about work .
But we don 't buy the hard time we feel it because we heard these things that we 've got all over the way we completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way reading and art , at the end , at the end , it will will be hard to hit .
And the question I want to get to everybody today is : you 're agreement with this idea ?
It 's good for you , because it 's just looking at it from a centimeter , it 's not good for anything about this suppose .
I think it 's hate .
And I think it 's even dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encourage our big creative minds to live .
And certainly , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start to fire out at the end of the surrounded of the circumstances in which I 'm in my career .
That 's what -- you know , I 'm pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I 've got about 40 years old .
I still have about four decades work in me .
And it 's very likely that any write about now is going to be judated by the world as the work that I came out of the last book .
I 'm going to be slams , because we 're all about the friends here -- is likely that my greatest success is to my walking .
Oh , Gesus , who think !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads one person to start to get a person to start behind a person starting to get a high and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep going to keep doing this job that I love .
So , the question is , how about it ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflections , that the way to work to keep write is to create a psychological cougical protectic coule , OK ?
I 've got to find a security distance of security between me , which I 'm written , and my natural reaction on which is going to be able to get the scary of the last year , looking for the last year , looking through the time , looking through the other societies to see if they could have the best ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy .
about how to help creative people creative to manage inherent people of creative creativity .
And that research me to ancient Grece and ancient Rome .
Sem because it turns out to circle and then back .
In the ancient Grecia and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity was coming from men , OK ?
He was thought creativity was this spirit of the spirit that was about divine and source to be someone from someone who was unknown and unknown , for distant and unknown .
The grew called the Greek these spirits of the creativity of demons .
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a demand that was going to else wisdom .
The Romanii was the same idea , but they call that kind of spirit without a genius .
which is great , because the Romanii was not really thought that a genius is someone who 's a little smart .
They thought a genius was that a genius of a divine that was going to be lived in literally in the walls of a artist , a little bit like the Dobby elfo , and that came out and resting out out of that work and the outcome of that work .
Exctional -- here 's the distance of which I talk about -- that 's the psychological couries that protection you from the results of your work .
And everybody knew that it was working , right ?
So the anti-certain artists protected things , like the too much narcissism , right ?
If you could not take all the way , you could not take all the deserve , everybody knew that you were helped by this until genius .
If your failing job , it wasn 't all your time , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a hunable .
And so people han concept creativity in Western for a long time .
Then Renascivement came and everything changed , and it was changed , and this big idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe , and the cle of the misters and and more without leaving space to write space creatures .
This was the rational of humanist . And people started to think that creativity was completely from the ished issues .
And for the first time in history , he started to referiring this or that artist as a rather like a person rather who 's a person with the genius .
And I must tell you , I think it was a big error .
I think allow someone , a simple person to believe , a simple person to believe as a source as a source , the essence and source of all the divines , creative , unknown and a huge way that is a lot of humans .
It 's how to ask someone to inguiate the sun .
It forms and behind the ego and creates all these unexpectable of these unexpectations on performance .
And I think it was this pressure that was destroyed pressure the artists in the past 500 years .
And , if that 's true , and I think it 's , the question is , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe back to a more old old understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't have 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would solleverage suspicians on the notion of the notion of , you do that follow people to spend up with their projects .
Probably not convinced you all about this thing .
But the question I want to take is -- why not ?
Why not think that way ?
Because it 's more sense of everything else that ever heard to explain the exasperformance of creative process .
A process , as everyone who ever tried to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- it doesn 't understand rational rational .
And in fact , it can sometimes it seems to completely paranormal .
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poeteteteteteteteteteteth , who 's now 90 , but it was a poetesse for all life and told me that was a poetesh for the Virginia , working out in the fields , and he was going to hear it , in the fields , and he was going out in the pay .
He said he was like a fragorous air train .
And he came up with her landscape .
It was going to be coming , because he was so much about it .
He knew you had one thing to do at that point and it was , he was , he " run like a math . "
And so he running up home and he was going to be followed by this poem , and it wouldn 't have to make a piece of paper and a matter enough , while the trapp , and he 's going to raise it and saying it on the page .
Sometimes he couldn 't be faster enough , and it 's running and run without getting back and running her and poetry her through her and poetry her through and the rotles was going through the landscape , and he would keep up through the landscape , and he would keep it up through the landscape , and he would keep it up through the landscape , and he would keep it up through her and go and rotate through the landscape , and he would keep up through the landscape and go back , and
Then there were those times -- this piece I will never forget -- there were some moments where it was almost losing it , OK ?
So , he was running up at home and he was looking for the card and the poem was going through , and he was a handle right in the while he was going , and then he said , " He was like he saving with the other hand and the coule .
He was going to the poem from the tail and reput it in his body and turned it on the page .
And in these cases , the poem was going to be presented on the perfect page and it 's going to the last word at the first .
So when I felt that I thought -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly equal to my creative process .
Not my creative process -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a mule , and my way to work is , wake up to wake up at the same time and take it and go to work and go and go and go above .
But even I 'm even in my head , I 've gone against that thing , at sometimes .
And I guess that many of you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , many of you , you know , you know , many of you , you know , you know , a lot of you ,
You know , even if the job and the ideas , and the ideas came to me from a certain source , I could not honestly .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it to be able to not to lose your head , but , rather , rather , rather , that does it do it remains yourself ?
As I 'm like , the best example of Tom Waits , which I have is the Tom musician , which I interviewed a different journal years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life has been the incarnation of the artment of the artment is that we 're talking about to control , to manage , to manage these species of creative totally interized creative craft .
But then I invent , he got up , and one day as he was driving on a driving car in Los Angeles , he changed everything for him .
She was going to faster and everything of a sent , this little broken sent this little piody of melody , which is going to be inspiration , and it wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and it 's not how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a matit , it doesn 't have a register .
So he starts to hear this kind of old anxiety in him , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'll remarried by this song lost .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , he stopped .
I 'm going to do the entire mental process and he made something completely new .
And he just look at the sky and he said , " Don 't you see that I 'm driving ? "
" It seems to write a song han hour ?
If you really want to exist , you can get back at a more opporting time when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , I go to important anything today .
You can see to the Leonard Cohen . "
And his worker changed after this .
Not the job , the job was still like .
But the process , and the fish that was required when the genius was required when the genius , the genius , the genius was going to go from , and he remainly remainly remainly that he was not going to be a interior of interior , and turned .
but it 's very well . It 's a beautiful bizarre collaboration in a conversation between Tom and this strange thing that was not Tom .
So how much the story started changing a little bit the way I worked on and already to save me a time .
This idea , I was saved when I was writing " Mangia , Prega , Ama , and fall in one of those cave when we 're working on something and we can 't start to think that it 's going to be a disaster , which is going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book .
Not just just the worst book , right the worst book .
And I started thinking about geping this project .
But then I remember Tom that was talking to the air and tried to it .
So I got up my face on the manubed and I realize my common a blackle corner to a black-bad corner corner .
And I said to high voices , " What , " do we know , " Do you know if this book isn 't going to be interacted with my , right , right ?
Because as I 'm going to see it all that I have , I don 't have any more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to introduce you and make your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know , I don 't do anything .
I 'll just writing the same because it 's my job .
And I want to say that it was recorded that I 'm presented to do my part . " Because in the end , " Because it 's so , OK -- secows ago , OK -- secows of North people recorded for the len of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle , and the high .
And they always were magnificent , because the ballers were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every once , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists was actually transpites .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you all seen it , at a certain point , a performance like .
It was like time stopped , and the dance dancerine walking through a kind of a claim and he wasn 't doing anything different from the usually , like 1,000 nights before , but everything was going to switch .
And suddenly , it doesn 't appear like a human .
But he turns out from the divinside the fire in the fire of divinity .
And when this happens , at the time , people knew what was , they call it with her name .
They knew their hands and started to canting , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God , " God , "
That 's God , you know .
Curious known -- when the Morors invaded the south of the Spain , I took this habits and pronounded changed in the centuries from " Allah , " Allah , " " " " Olay , " and the " Ole , " that 's still , " that you can hear in the round or in the floor .
In Spain , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , " Allah , " words , " Allah , " Buh , " ununderstandable , " incomprehensible , " incomprehensible , " untary God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But , the problem is coming the dancerce , when you wake up and discovering that are the 11 of the morning of Martedbs and discovering it that God is no longer .
It 's just a mortal with gineering a lot of bad to the gineering , and maybe it 's never going to be able to height .
And maybe no one will be a name of God still as it goes , and what has to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most pain recognitive to make in a creative life .
But perhaps not must be so angoscious if you can 't believe , actually , in fact , inturing , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being coming from yourself .
But you just believe that they 're going to be data on a unimaginable source of this source part of your life that you have to get to somebody else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think it 's all changes .
And so I started to think about it , and it 's certainly like this for several months during the worker of the book I 'll publishing up , the dangerous , spapers , I spent , and it 's a very successful success .
And what I 've got to continue to say when I feel elured by this is , not fear .
Not to go . It 's only your work .
Contineering presenting your part , any one can be .
If your work is dancing , bally .
If the divine , absurd genius to let 's go and let up up with some kind of wonderful , for one moment through your effort , just for one moment through your efforts , then , " Ole ! "
Otherwise , do the same thing .
And " Ole ! " " at yourself . "
I think it 's a little bit about it .
" Ole ! " at yourself , even for human love and heading so much to deal with huge and taggin to deal with you continue to introduce you to keep up again .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And as I 've talked about some of these projects on the human genome , about what can mean and meaning and the new set of new genes .
Now we 're starting a new path : We started to digitalize biology and now starting to digital code , we 're entering in a new phase of biology , designing and synthetizing life .
We 've always tried to get big questions .
" What is life ? " is something that many biologists , I think they 've been trying to understand and a lot of lithized .
We tried different approaches , reduced it to reduced it .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was going to be able to go from the analomic world of biology in the digital world .
Now we ask us : How regenerate life , or creating new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest genome that can autorem in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create one more smaller .
We can eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 genes that I 'm here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
Let me , that 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at a time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring a living cell a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to progrew up that was synthesize this chromosome to be able to modify components to bring up some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " Can we synthesize a chromosome ? "
It can 't be able to produce these big molecules that never have been able to create these big molecules that we never have to create before ?
And , in case , can we make a cromosome ?
A chromosome is just a chemist of inert material .
The speed that we can digitalize life is growing up is exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , prodiscuss rather slowly , but it 's better .
And our most recent results that we can take it on a exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process required a lot of passages , beginning with a bioethical review before we begin .
But we found that synthesize that DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of machines of cars on DNA , of the longer segment , 30 to 50 letter and it 's a degenerative process : the longer is longer , the segment is longer , the longer is there .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correct correct the errors .
And that was our first attempt , starting to the digital information genome of Phi X 174 .
It 's a little batteries that kills kills .
We designed the fragments , we did the correction of errors and get a molecule of DNA about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of inert material inert and we put it into the bacteria , the bacteria have started to read this genetic code and produced the genetic code and produced the viral particles .
The viral particles have been required by the cells , they came back and they destroy the E. coli .
I 've been talking about recent with membraning oil industry that they have certainly understood that they have certainly understood this model .
They 've gone over you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the bigger things in big .
We wanted to build the entire chromosome of the bacteria .
It 's over 580 miles letters of genetic code .
So we thought we 've thought I could build it in a seven of the virus , so that we can change the seven to understand what the seven of a living cell .
The design is critation is critical , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard , it was a herror for every 10 thousand bases .
We 've discovered , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence , we would never be able to be able to work .
One part of the process is designing 50 letters that they overoverlaps that are overlaps with all the segments of 50 letters to build smaller subunit that work together .
We try to do the only one one of the only one here .
Probably you 've read that we put on the physical filiguring .
Think it so : We have a genetic code based on four letters : A , God and To .
Three of those letters together code about 20 frightends , and there 's a specific order of reading for every adminoes .
So we can use genetic code to write words , frages , thoughts .
What we did about the first autography is authography .
Some have been used by the fact that it wasn 't poetry .
We designed these segments to just join these little segments .
There are enzymes that reputting them and assime .
And we started assemble with seven miles , starting with segments from five to seven miles , unending them in a way to form 24 miles hold up to the letter segments of them to get to 72 thousand letters .
We 've made these little challenging in abundance so that we 're trying to make them sequencing up because we 're trying to create a extremely robustood -- as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems like the tabellon a basketler playoff .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 thousand feet , it 's not going to grow more directly in the E. coli .
You go to the molecular modern modern symps of molecular biology .
So we 've considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called homologue recombination , which in biology that is using to recombination DNA can bring the segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , it can absorb three million rad rads .
You can see in the super requarter as his chromosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it 's just like before .
There 's thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely .
They can live under empty .
I 'm absolutely certain that life exists exists in space , and you move to find new water .
At the NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built these processes , just using these processes , just using the segments of the segments that we 've done .
The least lights the authorse .
This image was not taken with a microscope , but with a regular microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It 's a big molecule that we can see it with a microscope with a law .
These are pictures that cover a six seconds .
This is the advertising we did a little time ago .
It 's over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined structure that man 's ever created by the man .
It 's got a molecular weight to 300 million .
If we stammed with a caratter 10 without spaces , they would like 142 pages , it would just like 142 pages .
Now , how do we work ? How do we get it ?
Obviously , a virus is a game of guys .
It 's a little more complicated when they use .
It 's simpler even when it 's ekarios as it : you can just extractly the nucleus and insert another , which is practically the bad process of clonation .
In the archaea , the archaea is integrated inside the cell , but we recently recently , we recently demonstrated that we can do a transplant transplant of a cell cell to another and activity .
We can refed a cromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different how men from the men .
We 've got added some gene in a little bit more that we can decide what to choose for this chromosome .
The men with the sciold-hy-hy-hy-handle .
And when we put it in the cell was amazing -- and you 'll appreciate our sustering graph -- the new chromosome , the new chromosome of went into the cell .
And we started thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to spines in the way .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We 've found that so many species have added species have added a second or a third chromosome of new tracks to a thousands of new tracks to the species .
So who think evolution is only a gene gene to evolution as only gene has no understood a lot of biology .
There 's a bit of the enzymes called restraight that actually actually digerisn 't going to digerisn 't going to be a DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell , you can 't have one .
The cell phone that we 've inserit-cell phone that we 've inserit-hours .
It 's expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome , as a munder material , and we came up with only the cell and the new chromosome .
it blue to become blue because of the genes we put .
And in a short lash of time , all the characteristics of a species have gone , and it turned into a new species , based on the new species , based on the new software that we put in the cell .
Everything proteins have changed , membranes are changed , and when we read the equivast to what we 've been taking on the exactly to what we 've turned out .
Now , this may seem alchemixics , but it 's high the software , but it 's high enough to change things .
Now , I 've explained that I 'm not talking about genesis -- but we progress to three million years old evolution , and I 've been told that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's obvious when we think about our needs .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people at nine billion in the next 40 years .
Right for give example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicinals and gas for six billion and a half billion people .
It will be more tough to be doing it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion coal , more than 30 billion oil , more than 30 billion oil .
That means 100 million bets a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or whatever you try to reduce them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep all the CO2 emissions from these materials that ends up the atmosphere .
At day , thank you to scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they 're designed for the future .
The electronics industry only only has a dozen about a dozen of components , and think about how many different things came out .
Our limits here are basically data from the biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , thank you very much quickly , these methods of synthetization , that can create what we call a combatory .
We can build a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million chromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes or different genes or to try to make optimize the processes to produce either eight-new vaccines , we can change , thank through a little team , and to create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for chance of survival , production , production chemistry , production of ethical vaccines .
This is a few instantaneous instantaneous instantaneous instantaneous for that we 're working on to be able to make a computer species .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how they will be .
We know exactly what the genetic code .
Now we 're focused on fuel of quarters .
You also saw you who are ethanol from the grant was a finished experiment .
We have a lot of second and third generation that will use enough to sugar enough to the higher than than either value or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increasingly increases the cost of food and limitate the availability is to transform CO2 in matter , so we 're working on to design cellubrate cells that can get to the CO2 in matter , and we think we can get the first generation of doing in about 18 months .
The solar light sunlight with CO2 is a metodom -- but in our discoveries around the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2500 feet deep at the temperature of the water .
They methane by CO2 using molecular hydrogen , as well as a source of energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can meaning the CO2 , which can easily be transported by the way , convert that CO2 in order to drive this process .
So , we think we can get a short to increase what the basic question of what the basic question what is life is Nice , versus -- we have the goal of -- we have the goal of replacing oil industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where can you ?
It would be a main source of energy .
Also , we 're working on to use the same way to create instantaneous wines .
You 've seen this year with the influence , we 're forth to a year and a dollar in less when it 's about to find the right vaccine .
I think that 's going to change building vaccines in a combined vaccines .
This is how the future would start to look at changing , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating the tree of synthetic , archy , and finally for eukariote .
We 're so much from the best people .
Our is to do a long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'll show you , the most fundamental work , some fundamental job , the new technology that we took to Microsoft , in followed a year ago exactly . This is Seadragon .
It 's a lot of a environment that you can interacting is at local level that remote with a huge amount of data .
So , we 're seeing a lot of gabyte photos with a kind of zoom constant and continuous , for a quick , and by a quick quick , by disponing the images , how we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big they are these gets of data or images or images .
Most of the most are digital photographs , but this is a sansion scan from the Bioowner of Congress , and reflip into the gamma of 300 megael .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not not images .
This is the Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
To show you that it 's about textbooks and not images , we can do something like that , to actually show you really representation of a representation of the textbooks .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little electronic book .
It 's not the advice .
This is a more realistic example . It 's about a few of The Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of a magazine or a newspaper , which is for nature , a lot of a lot of type of half .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We created a higher higher advertising -- much more than than that you use in a normal advertising -- and we put it in a normal advertising -- and we put you in the extra of the extra content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even the techniques .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
It 's hope that that means that it 's going to put up to the pop-up and other synails , not must be necessary .
Of course , mapping is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not losing time , if we don 't say that we have to give you to this field in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. survasashes over a geod-spaces of NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually actually , right now from the web , you can go to the web .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual visual computer that was very interesting to Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve . It 's a very good collaboration .
And it 's from Seadray , gestion Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screens , where we can go from one image to another and have this kind of experience , and have this kind of experience in multiple .
But the space of the images here has actually a meaning meaning .
The algorithms of visualization computers have recorded these images together , so that correspond to the real place in real place in which the images -- all of these things that are spaces .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some much more space space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Nohy-od-like prototype of Photosynnnthrow that we 've done for the first scorsea of the scorsea .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of the Notre of Dame of the Coller . Baast digitar . To one of these argue Dame in Flickr and you get images of the other fies of the campus and so on . Only , of these arancions represented a picture that is discovery .
So they 're all pictures taken from Flickr and they were all connected to the space level in this way .
And it 's possible to Navigate this way simple .
You know , I never thought I would never have thought I 'm going to end up with Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying to get this kind of ackage here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of types of different skinds of phones to the SLR , a meaning , a significant number , message , in this environment .
And if I can , I try to look for those strange .
A lot of them are faces , etc .
Somewhere somewhere here 's a series of photographs -- here .
This is a poster of Notre Dame recorrectly .
We can go from the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment is taking data from the ential memory of the collective death from the whole memory of view -- and that 's connections to all the data together .
Everybody is getting connected together , more than the parts .
You have a model of the entire emerges .
Think about this as a Stephen Lawler 's work on Earth 's work .
It 's something that 's going to grow in complexity as that people use it , and the people that are going to use it , and the other people who are going to increasing with the use .
Their pictures are sea with bunch of other people .
If someone is the idea of the idea of these things that you can say the name , my picture of Notre of the chthedral of Notre of the data , and I can use it as a craft-moment in that metaphor to dive in that metaphor , in that metaphor , using the photos of cross-moed experience of cross-moed cle-moed experience of cross-moke .
Of course , a consequence of this is virtual models of all interesting models of the earth , collected not only by afraid of the airs and satellitaries , but from the collective , but from the collective memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software will connected to us to do is that at a certain point , in the next few years , all the photos , the photographs that are going to be basically connected together ?
BAA : Yes . What he 's doing is basically discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And he 's doing it in the basis on the bottom content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of semantis that many of these images have to have a lot of these images have to be able to do .
As when you get a picture of images on the web , digits phrase and the textboard has a lot of information about the web has a lot of information about the pictures .
Now , what if that pictures you connects to all your pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection and semantic and the amount of wealth that is really huge . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the major pleass when it travels and one of the research of the ethnographics is living between who has not forgoes in the wind , and who 's going to wind the wind , touch in the wind , touches in the wind leap .
Basti think that 's Jaguar travel also traveling the Via of the Wilk , or that the old Inuit is still a sense of meaning , or in Himalayas , the buddists still , the buddists of the Dharma , to remember the major the idea that the world 's important of the major end of the makes , and that the idea that the world that the world that we live in not exists , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the following of a particular set set of choices that our own own own own own own own own is , good or a lot of generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
We all hire . Everybody procrew .
We 're going to be returned out .
We have to deal with the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprisinging and we 're going to get out of the drive ,
We all have a art .
What it is the special rhythm of the song , the rhythm of dance .
It doesn 't matter that they 're the Penan forests of the Borneo , or the following Vooodoo Haiti , or the desert Kenya , or the desert Kenya , or a cammouth in Kenya , or a cammas in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a yaks of yaks in the game valley , on the mother of the world .
All these people teaching us that there are other ways of existing other ways of thinking , other ways to move in the world .
And , if you reflection a second , it 's a concept that it can give you hope .
Insit together , the miriades of cultures world creating a spiritual life and cultural life that is important for the well-being and cultual well-being of the planet as the biological ragnature as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural record as a ethnosphere and you can define the total ethnosphere , the total ethnosphere , mites , inspiration , wites , inspirations , witches , inspiring in being from the human fieldness .
The etnosphere is the patrimp is a patrimonum .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in as a species .
And because the biosphere was free consumed as well as it was in the ethnosfetnosh and much much more rapidly .
No biologist , for example , it would say 50 percent of all species , or is on the horrim of just because it 's false , it 's false -- in the most optic hypocalyckical diversity -- and not near to get close to the most optimistic poorest -- that of cultural diversity .
The index of all that is , obviously , the language .
When you were born in the world , there were 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a vocabulary vocabulary or a series of rules .
One language is the middle of human spirit .
It 's the middle of every culture is coming in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a glue thinking , a spiritual chance .
And of those 6,000 languages , while we 're here sitting in Monterey , at least half , it 's not more sursed in the ears of children .
They 're not teached to children , which means , unless it , unless it 's not going to fix , that they 're already dead .
What is more sad than being the silence , the last security of the silens , the last few few people to talk a language , not to have way to transmit the wisdom of the promise of children ?
This is a faired by someone in the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , a holding older is a light-holding , the latest syllables of a old old old old old old old old old old old ,
And I know somebody who will say , " Isn 't that that ?
The world doesn 't it be a better place if we talk all the same language ? " Well , then we talk to all yorba . We talk to all yorba . It 's about a cantonese .
We talk kogue .
You 'll cover a traits of a tracks .
Today , I 'd like to do you a journey through the labor --
a little journey in the ethnosphere to give you a hire of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of existing truly different ways of existing existing .
Let 's take for example this Barasana Barasana , in Amazon , the settle popular , which crees to the myth of the snaps of the snaps of the snaps of snaps .
It 's a popular that it 's not able to distinguished the blue color from the green because the celests is identified in the time of the forest , which depends the popular .
They have a strange language and a marriage , he says " " " " " " You must " " " " You must get to marriage a different language . "
Everything has radical in the past , but the particular particularity is that in these exists that are in these exists that are talking about six or seven languages , no one practice .
They 're limited to listening and then start talking to .
Let 's take one of the most interesting tribe that I 've lived , the Waorani of Ecuador norts of norts of norts of the most contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 missionaries have tried a commodity .
They did go down from the photo photos that had been retended them in a few who thought that this population population , and that this population of the pluvial forestyle had never seen anything about bi-dimensional .
They 've been collected the photos , they turned to the research of a form or a figure out , and they 've got nothing , they 've got to killed the five thousand missionarise the five thousand missionarious missionarious with the lightful .
But the Waorani didn 't just killed the strange .
They killed in their own .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We 've been high high generations and found two of death and when we switched to know , they loved that one of them , they had a tremendous one of them , and then they were killed it . Rated Addate , and then they kill it the same .
The hunters were able to recognize the 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the first 1980s , I was assigned a very interesting task when my professor when I was asked to Harvard to be in Harvard , I wish to go to Haiti in the first 1980s to the base of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and impossessing me to make the zombigger of the use of the speed that I used to do the zombigger zombird of the use of Duvard , and I immediately reached to do the zoxide of the wd me in the first ' 8
To make sense of miraculous meaningful , I should understand the Vodn culture and that Vodoo culture is not magic .
It 's pretty much than a complex metaphysical view of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianism , Ism , Budddddddddism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that it 's not going to have to be a religious field . And instead of religious . And instead of these very profound , is not that the distillate of these very profound nothing that is that the distiller of these religious concepts of slavery .
What makes the vote is interesting vote is the report between life and death .
So the living is hidden .
The spirits can be invocated by the Great Aqua , responate to the dance of dance and replaced temporary to the soul of the view of a brief across a long time , for a long time , for a long time , and then you can get the god .
So , the voodooists say , " You 're white white you 're going to ask about God .
We say in the temple and forget God . "
And from the time you 're going to be , is the spirit that you can do the bad you guide , how can you do the bad you ?
So you see these incredible events : followers in the state of trance that touch that touch of trance that touch that touches handle of the power when it 's catalyed in a state of extreme , when it 's catalyed in a state of extreme extreme extreme .
It was all over the popular that I lived the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada de Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta , in Colombia sector .
Do taking the ancivilization , who was living on the ply-of-based plug on the cooking , the popular popular massive played on the vulcanic mass that you erge on the characbs .
In a blood continent sweeth , this popular never been conquered by the spagnology .
At today , they 're governed by a clero , but their formation is very extraordinary .
The followers are taken away from the families to three or four years , and they live in a good world , and they live in a good world , and they live in a good world , and they live in a good world 's boat for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years old by reproduce reproduce nine months of gestation that spend in the user of the mother , are metaphor now are metaphor in the user of the Great Mother .
So that time , they get acculturated to the values of their society , values that they predict and only their predict their predict and their predict to keep the cosmic balance -- or to say the coal eality .
At the term of this incredible initiation , they 're suddenly taken out and for the first time in life , at the age of 18 , they see a high . And in that accounterness of the first cutes of the cutters , when the sun is , the values of beautiful landscape , everything that learned in the splanding of the landscape . The path is a step says ,
" Visto be ? I 'm like you .
It 's amazing . It 's now to you protect it . "
They 're called called the greater fratest frackles and say that we , we 're the hit , we 're the hit of destruction of the world .
This level is extremely important .
When we think about indeed populations and the environment we 're invoking and the old story of the noble story of the wild , which is a raztic concept in its simplicity , or maybe invoking Thoreau and say that we say that these populations are closer to the Earth of us .
The indebate is not feeling in the ind-nor indebull .
There 's no space for these things in the datuds of Astmen or in the gelids of the Tibet , but thank you to the time and return , they created a mistics of the Earth based on a balls of the concept of being knowledge , but on a by-human-powered war war .
What does it mean ?
To say that a boy of the Ande who grew up that mountain is a cool spirit that mountain is a human spirit , it will be a different destiny , and it will be a different destiny , and it will say that place with the mountain or that place , and answer to a kid of Montana .
which is the dimora of one spirit or a mineral car is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the report between the natural and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Britannica British credating that forests served to be cut .
That 's made me a different human being from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that forests are Hukuk and the shape of the paradise and the short of paradise and the spirits that live on the northern world , spirits that live in the northern world , spirits that deal with the Hukuk .
If you start looking at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of their discovery . We take this plant .
I 've taken this picture to open in the nordocted in the north-doctor .
Mayahuge some of you 've heard about the ayahuash , the most powerful substance of the sciamanic repertoire .
What makes the gahuge is not the physical potential of the sustainance of the substance , but its elaboration . It 's two two elements from two elements .
From a leash , this leash leth-carbolin , harmine , harmine and harming harming , harmine and harming moles .
Take the only plant , you have a blue smoke that it a little bit of consciousness , but it 's misceled with the leaves of a family , Psychotria .
This plant contains powerful tripamine , very similar to serotonin , methoxyptamine-thoxyptamines .
If you ever see the Yanomami , you 'll see the nose the sustainance that make from a different set of species , anchy contains methoxyptamine .
Adust for the nose is a little bit like being gone from a little bit of how to be shooting up with a fire of pink and land on a sea of electricity . It doesn 't creates a distortion of reality .
I often often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who had taken the psycheedelic , with his discovery of fungi in Mexico .
I think Second my thesis can 't classified these tripamines like hallucinogens because if you 're not told anybody to be hallucinated . And the triployed . Look can 't tell you . because they 're money from a naturally in the intestine , which is naturally in the intestine , detailed .
It 's possible to absuit it only if you 're taking with other chemicals that money at MAO .
Now it 's the beautiful : the beautiful , which is in this liana is ininhibitors of MAO , the same kind of potential , that 's going to be able to be able to be able to to get the tripamines . The spontanem spontanem , like these populations are not similar , but if you combined in this way , create biochemical version of the parts ?
We use the great eulife-proof error , which can be revealing .
But if we ask the Indians will say , " The plants are talking about . "
What does it mean ?
This tribe , the cofan , the coping , who has 17 varieties of the game , which are going to be able to go into the forest , and that to our eyes would be going to the same species .
If we ask them how to make their tasonomics say , " I thought about it , " I thought about the plants , " I thought about plants , " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take the 17 varieties in a night of while and each night with a little bit of a little bit .
With this doesn 't you laurea Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that to count stami .
Now , [ it ] the problem is that even the ones of us who have to heart people who have in their ingenes that are pittorm , but somehow reduced to the sea of history of our real world , and it 's going beyond .
In fact , the 19th century , between 300 years , it will not be remembered for its wars or its innovations , but rather like the way we were stopped and abbraced actively or passion-accepted destruction of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
Everybody cultures through the seals have been involved in a dance for new dance possibility of life .
And the problem isn 't technology .
Indians Sioux didn 't stopped to be Sioux when they put from the arrow and fill as well as Americans have no stopped to be Americans when they put from the horse and cales .
It 's not the change or the technology that 's the integrity of the ethnosphere .
The hard fly of the domination .
And if you look at the world , you 'll find that these are not cultures that these are not cultures that these are not cultures .
They 're living creatures and dynamics spines out of identifable existence that go beyond their ability .
Which is that it 's disboscening in the Patria --
a populpulpulpull named Sarak , in the Souast Asian popular who lived to the forest to a generation , and now reduced to the service and the servitos on the edge and the prostitution on the recorded reflection , where you can see the polluted by the way to see the MCinese Merian Merian Cinese Meridiond , where naves the naveling ,
ready to fill the stock with the wood I dream with the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease coming with the discovery of the gold .
If we 're going to move on the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard of political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physical extinction of a popular , it 's convicted to universal , but the ethnocide , the destruction of a popular living , not only is convicted , but it 's not only convicted , but it 's not only convicted , but it 's part of the development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet until you can 't understand the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in China in Cocern through the South Southeast South Eastly , and I got to Lhasa with a young , but only came to Lhashasa , I realized what we 're talking about .
6,000 sacred monuments in dust dust and cenhing .
1.2 million people killed by the military military during the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical to Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to the time of the Chinese invasion .
Sua uncle uncrowed with Sua Santity , which led to the diaspora who took the popular in Nepal .
Her mother was imprified and her colpleased and her her color was going to be rich .
It was taken to hidden in a two years old age under his guns , because he wouldn 't have lived without him .
The sister , who did the same , was in a reeducation camp .
One day he had been walking a day running standing a row statement , for this transgression , was mesh to seven years old works .
The pain of Tibet can be insured , but the referable spirit of the people is holding .
At the end , all the time , it reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the world of monotonia or we want to across the world polymicromate world of diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he died said that his greatest fear was that , in our way to go toward this amords of the world , we 're not only going to see the entire gamma of human imagination , but one day we 'll be wake up from a sleep to forget from a sleep to forget from a sleep , and we 'll be able to a wake up with a sleep .
And it 's humiliating humiliating our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The Neolitical Revolution , who gave us the agriculture , which made us suck to the cult of the seed of the cler , creating the poem of the sler of the sler of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has 300 years old .
That 's a story not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal with the millennia that we 're going to go .
When these miriades of cultures in the world is asked what it means to be human , respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all realize the possibility of being what we are -- a consciousness , which has to make all the people and all the gardes can challenging . And there are great moments of either optimim .
I 've taken this photo on the north of Baffin , when I went to hunt hunt hunt , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The canadical government was not always gentleming with the Inuit and in the 1950s to stay our premise our premise , we 've recovered them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , I 'm afraid for his life , brought all his arms , and all his attices .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't matter cold , framework .
The batts of the sled-in galed fishing in the skin in .
The grandfather than this man didn 't intimise from the arctic night or from the libraries that he had had been suffiels .
It 's gaps to gattackaged , it 's hot the bits in the skin and defected in your hand . When the focused , I did it with her a bama bama .
He sprawled on the door of this cut and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
He wages and created a brid , with a hundred house , and he created a sled-created hard , a sled-up , and it 's disappeared on the banker ,
We want to talk about cavarsely with anything ?
In the candisplaces , 1999 , the canader Inuit to the total control of a territory area of a larger area of California and Texas to .
It 's their new patria new patria .
It 's a independent territory . They control all the minerary resources .
One beautiful example of how a nation-state can recognize with his people .
And , to finish , I think it 's rather obvious than we had in these remote zones of the planet , remote that they remote not at remote .
For someone is home .
They represented sections of the human imagination that are representing high at the high of these children , as the dreams of these children , as the dreams of these children , become part of the hope of the hope of the hope .
To finish , we 're going to be in the finish that politicians will never get to nothing to be to nothing .
We believe the polemiics --
[ Applausi ] no persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the world . Every month is going to be 35 million visitor .
156 countries are transmit our television canal .
Our reached our lights from millions of people .
Our work is traveling ethnosphere to bring our audience in places of wonders that are going to go away from how they 're going to go away from how they 're going to the central revelation of the anthropology , will will be able to get to fly in the central revelation of life in a pluralistic world .
where the wisdom of all the people can contributing to our wisdom .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I written in this book that I hope that you 've heard and try to evidence some connections , in the case , it doesn 't notice .
I want to start with what I call " the " official dogma . "
The dogma official dogma of what ?
The dogma official dogma 's official dogma 's dogma official dogma : " If we want to massimize the west-being of our citizens " The way to do it is to massimilar the individual liberty . "
The reason is , from a hand , in the fact that freedom is in itself a value , it 's precious , use , essential for humans .
The other is that if we 're free , each of us can act for all of us can act for all that massimilar to do everything that massimilar our well-being , without any decided to name .
The way to massimilar to the freedom is massimilar .
More people have , more choices , more than people are free , and more than their liberty , the greater is their well-being .
This , I think , it 's so deeply radicated in society that no one would dream of them .
And it 's also deeply radicated in our lives .
I 'll show you some examples of what progress has done possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I 'm a simple note about condition .
In my supermarket , there are 175 condition , without content 10 varieties of oil and the 12 acetes of oil and 12 acetes , and the 12 bags , and the 12 bags of the crowd circumstance that no 175 ready ready ready ready ready ready ready to your degree .
Here 's what supermarket .
Then go to the electronics to buy a stereo scale : cases , letter , radio , the CD , radio , the CD , radio , the CD , the CD , prints .
And in this single electronics , there 's a big number of audio components .
We can make six million and a half of different combination using the components that there are only in one only one store .
We need to admit that there 's a lot of choice .
Other the camps : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the phone services , to the desire , to the path that was provided by mom Bell .
It was for it .
A consequence of that , between the other , was that the telephone never break .
These days went .
Now we have a variety of phones , especially in the cell phones .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is the middle in the middle , the nose of the nose , and forth for the crykey , and forth for the crash .
If you don 't see it in the negotie in the side , you 're going to be able to be taken certain that you 're going to be going to be able to be .
And what happens is that people go into the store and asked this question . And you know , what is the answer ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the buyers , the same explosion of choice .
Audge healthcare : no longer happens in the United States that you go from doctor and the doctor , you must be going to do .
Instead , walk from doctor , and the doctor says , " Okay , we can do A , or B , " A , " A , " A has these benefits and these risks " B , " B has these benefits . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Doctor , what should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , and B has these benefits and these risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you can rebad , " Dottore if she was me , what would it do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not her . "
The result , we call it a malate autonomy , expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But it 's not actually that a moving the weight and the responsibility of taking someone who knows the doctor , to someone else knows -- and almost of it is not about -- and so it 's not in the ideal condition to take , and so not in the ideal condition to take .
There 's a huge marketing of drug products , directly to people like me and you , that if you think about it doesn 't have any sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do they publishing them ?
The answer is that they want to doctor to ask us to change the recipe .
Something so fundamental as it is our identity is a question of choice , how to see in this vignize , " We don 't want to force the children . " We don 't want to be a heriting to the right time , " We don 't get a identity : we need to invent .
And we can reinvent how many times you get it .
which means that every morning , at the time , at the rising , you must decide that kind of person wants to be .
I 'm going to do family and marriage , a time , a common time , a common perspective , almost for anyone , was that he was marriage possible , and he was started to make the most possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not not when , and not even what to do after .
At day , it 's really to play .
I teach very smart students , and I 'm 20 percent of them in less than a time .
And not because they 're less diligent , not because they 're less diligent .
but why I 'm impensiered , intentions to ask , " Would I wouldn 't I ? "
" Would I get marrier ? " I have to think before the children or the career ? "
I 'm a logorange interrogorange .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if that is not completing the tasks that asks and not get a beautiful vote to my own extending .
And they have to do it . They 're important .
Now , the job : we 're lucky , like Carl socketry , because it allows us to work every day , from every day , from the Hotel Randolandolotel .
It 's talking about it , there 's a cornership , and I 'm not going to say that , where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work ? It 's continually decide , we 're going to go on every moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our child playing , with the cell phone in a cell , the Blackberry in the other , and the notees , and the notees , and the notea , and the notea .
And even though they 're all spent , every minute that we see our child rotate , we 're also asking , " I should say , " Would I say , " Would I say , " Would you say , " I have to say , " Would you say , " Would you see it in the game of the byoung , we 're also asking , " I should say
" I have to say that ? "
And even when the answer is no , " all that makes the experience of your child very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the watch , little things , big things , and big materials and lifetime , life is a question of choices .
The time was this : On , there were some possibility , but it wasn 't a question of choice .
The world today is it a good thing , is , " Is it a good thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Shyt .
The positive side of the slide side , so I 'm going to talk about the negative ones .
All this company two effects two negative effects of people .
The first one , paradoxes is that produces instead of liberation .
With so many options between which choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I 'm offered you a significant study : a conducted plans of volunteer plans .
A lines that had access to the Vancium data , the gigantic societies , with about a million clients of the deal , with about a million clients of employees .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are being offering in more , the percentage of adesion , two percent .
With 50 funding funds , there 's 10 percent in less than when they 're available to only five percent of them . Why are they only five percent ?
Because with 50 funds of the way to choose , is sick is to decide , and the choice is remainly hard to decide ,
And to questions , and I still ask questions , questions , and of course , tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and of course ,
You know that doesn 't mean only that these workers are going to hand they 're not going to have enough money , because they 're not going to have enough money , it also means that the decision is so ostics that they 're going to lose the funding of complementary .
Not participating , they 're losing up to five dollars per year from the work , which is a few dollars for the dator , which is going to be well .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world like this .
" And to finish , for eternity : ketchup , senaps or maionese ? "
You want to take the right decision , if it 's for the right , if it 's for the ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong source , and not want to the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoid the paralysis and make a choice , we 're not going to be able to do a choice , we 're not going to be with less options than than than we would have been to do with .
And that 's for several reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of condition between which is you buy , if you buy one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you would have been able to do a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagine it indues to be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us crowed by the decision ,
even when it was a very good decision .
More than there are , the easier is easy to be dispileverage of any detail than any option .
Also , there 's what economists call constood called opportunity .
Dan Gilbert asked very well as a value of the value that we depend on things that we 're depends on what we compare .
As the rest , when there are so many options , it 's easy to represent the characteristics of the alternative , and be less soddissatisfacts , which is choice .
Here 's an example . I gave all the people who are not in New York .
But it 's what you probably think about it .
There 's this pair to Hamptons .
A place of lussilly .
It 's beautiful . It 's all for them .
Not hand-nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , it 's August . "
" Everybody my neighbors to Manhattan is out . "
" I could talk to just like it in front of home . "
And it spend two weeks from the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the chance of parking for -- the chance of parking ,
The constood of the satisfy opportunity for what we have , even when the choice was an excellent .
And the more are the options that we 've got to consider , more the characteristics are going to recognize us .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of this living in a lot of things .
It talks about living the moment , and maybe maybe living slowly .
But the most important point is that any you choose , you 're choose , you 're going to do the other .
The things that we don 't choose have so many attractive attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : : it 's going to be growing up .
I tried it on my skin buy a new couple of jeans .
I 'm going to be jeans .
Once the jeans were just like , buy them and bought them and walking them from the bestion , they were dissioned , just after having them a living and jeans , and wasn 't going to .
So , I went to buy a new , when the old old one , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cutter . "
The commit told me , " He wants to slim fit , he relaxed fit , relaxed ? "
I want to want to them with the cernight-buttons ? "
" You want to want to strapped ? "
" Sottold them , " Bug , " Budle blaw , " Continured to elencare . "
I was smart , and after a while I was able to say , " I want the only kind of , " I want the only kind of , " I want to say , " I want to say , so for a time , so for a time , I went out from the negoties , and then I came out of the jeans that ever had .
It was the massim . And that was all that choice , I got the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I 've written a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse with all that choice is that with all the aspectative , the jeans had to be perfected .
I was expectations , I wait . I didn 't expect anything exceptional when it only existed it only existed , but when it was only a different kind of had to be perfect .
What I was bought , but I didn 't perfect .
After I was compared with what I was going to look for the expectations .
The addition of options in the life of people 's life doesn 't make the expectations that these have respect to the options of the same .
And that 's going to produce less soddisfed , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the marketing world in marketing .
Because if you know , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth is more like this .
" He was better when he was worse . " The reason he was better when he was worse , it was worse when he was worse , he was worse , you can meet to meet the surprised .
At day , in the world we live in -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the expectancy of perfeet -- the massize that we can hope is that things are at the height of the aspectative .
You never have surprised surprised because your waitable , my aspectations , you 're ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse wait , " Yes , " You want to . "
I mean , little authobiographical moment -- which I 'm really marries and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't have to do better , I didn 't have to do it .
But it 's not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of the buy jeans when there is only that when you 're only that 's the jeans of jeans is that when you 're not satisfacts , and ask you , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " " " The answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What can I do you do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a lot of it , and you bought a inslide , and you ask you who 's responsible , it 's the responsible , it 's just as a responsible for the responsible , it 's the responsible , it 's the responsible , it 's the responsible , is
You might have done better .
With hundreds of available varieties , there are no screens .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is walking , they feel insed and give the hit to their hit to their own .
In the last few years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but the only important -- of this wave is that people have experiences of depression is just that people have experiences because the standards are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that colcolor is them .
So the final result is that we 're in general better , but we 're going to feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogma dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than having it , but it doesn 't have a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic value . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been playing that we 've been playing the level where the best choices our life .
Now , from political point of view -- I 've got almost finished -- from political point of view , the political nocycle is the following .
What 's all that allows all this choice in the industrial society is the material .
There are many places in the world , and you know about it , where the problem isn 't that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they too little bit too little .
So the face that I 'm talking about is a modern exclusive of modern , recognize societies .
And what does mentioned and anrage is this : Steve Levitt talked about how much about those expensive and discovered seats for bimbers are inuseless . It 's a sprinker .
I mean these choices , complicated and dispendious , it 's not just that they 're just inured .
I 'm going to say , " Let 's get it .
They get worse about it .
If a little bit of what in our societies allows that was reverse in those where people have too much as well as a chance , not only is their life to be better , but also , it 's not just the better ,
This is what economists call a pareting improving .
A redistribution of the redddistribution is all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice , in a way that comes back to us .
To conclude , " You can become everything that you want to become everything that you want , "
You know , people of culture , you 'll think , " What does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get to a glass . "
" A castrated imagination , a limited view of the world --
and that 's what I 've interpreted this , at the beginning .
But then , think about it , instead , I realize that fish the long-term .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you eat the board , so that it 's possible to be not get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the books , so that it 's possible to decrease the satisfaction .
Let me get the paralysis , and you can reduce the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too much , perhaps for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of a sphere is a recipe for infected and , for the roin , for roine .
Thank you very much .
