The year last year I showed these slides to demonstrate that the glacial glacial , which is about 40 million years had had had the size of the United States continental , it 's refed 40 percent .
But that is the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice .
The artics calculate glacial cleaning is , in a sense , the heart of the global climate system .
You can see it inverinter and you revernowads .
The next slide is a fastern going to be a faster on the last 25 years .
The ice lost lost lost of these are produced in red .
You can see , you can expand , you can expand the blue .
That 's the ice in inverinter , which is in the inverinter .
You can see that the ice ice ice ice ice ice , and five years , it 's like the blood , that 's like the blood , that 's like the blood , which is like the blood ,
In 25 years , it 's spent from this .
This is a problem because the scale of the entire scale of the ground , in the ocean , where there are enormous amount of coal congeled that , switched , they 're turning into the microbes .
It 's specectures of the atmospect of the atmospect of global warming , that quantity could double , superformance of the woud-warming .
In some deep hi hi , in the Alaska , the methane is already bollying on the water .
The professorous Katey Walter of the University of Alaska , I 've been reverse with a team crown-scored team .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Lax is good .
A reason that is that this termal examples from the North .
This is a glacial fiume .
The ported never had ever reached levels .
This is the Kangerlussuaq in the west southeast of the Greenland of the Greenland .
If you want to know how the level of the sea level of the sea of the melting of the sea , here is where it reaches the sea .
These corrings are increasing fast .
Another part of the planet : Antarctopus of the planet .
The month scored scientists have been clearly as the balance is in negative , and that the Antarcttarcttops , which is particularly fastern in the smooth , is particularly fasterly in the sligheth .
Equeuveral at six meters of the handle , like Greenland .
And the Himalayas , the biggest block of ice , you see new laghi , which was a few years ago , that years ago were glaciers .
The 40 percent of the world population will remind half the water from the slightly the slide .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of this city .
The ported is increased .
But when it decrease , the same happens to the water .
In California the snow on the Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The hybacks are in cribe .
The predictions , as you read , they 're flex .
The growth of secity in the world 's leading to an unency of the incends .
The disasters environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm out of the normal and previous .
Four times more numerous numerous numerous than 75 years ,
This is a whole thing that 's an unsustainable .
If you look at it in the stories of it , if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of tons of CO2 every 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look attentirely the Eastern Pacific area , from the Americas , and the Americas , and on both the parts of the Indian Island-oxygen , where there is a radical imum in the oceans .
The major causes of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuel .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with the most emissions , together at China .
And it was proposed to build a lot of other mix squeeeeats .
But we 're looking at a changing of direction .
These are the annoullates in the last few years and some proposes of vernatives .
And every way , there 's a politics in our country .
The coal of the coal and the oil industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year for promoting coal , which is a bone .
And that image I remember something --
I 'm going to be Natal Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion lights of coal switches .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the largest floor of scories in America .
It happened around the Natale .
The nature of one of the coal industries of one was this .
Video : Shy the coal , and I 'm going to be a tremendous allegro and happy .
It 's abundant in America , and it growth our economy .
Frosty the carbon is always more and more .
It 's good price , and adorable the workers and workers keep the stayed .
Al Gore : It 's a part of the West Virginia .
The largest mineral society is Massey Coal . This is his amministrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'm going to be asked -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alance for the Clima 's Protection , and I launched two campaiged .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Actor : ALergy see the COLergy see the climate change like a threatens in our business .
So our priority is to investing a great amount of money in a force public force to make public and confused to public and confused to the truth .
In fact , coal is not sport .
We think it 's also a good provide .
So not preocupatevs of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Carbone , you 've heard a lot of it .
So we do a turn around a turn in a structure at the pattern of coal ,
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noise , but that 's the sound of the coal technology of the coal technology .
The coal consumption is between the main the cand-cand-cand-warming technology , but the coal technology of clean that you see changes everything .
You have a look at : This is the hodial technology of the clean clean .
Al Gore : In the end of the native , the positive connect to economic question and the national security of the national security .
Video : The America is in America is in cribe , the national security , the national security ,
The flows that the lines of all : our dependence on fossil fuel , like the coal and the important oil .
Now , there 's a new car , a new car ,
Repower America : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work in the work , make sure , and help us to stop global warming .
So , a solving that solve solve our problems .
Repower America . Scover of more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's about re-re-re-up .
One of the faster ways to get the end of the faster combustiable to kill our planet .
What it 's going to do is : The future is here . I mean , a new energy network .
What I 'm going to do is a bunch of bunch of work .
Coming : Repower America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old old old old African old old African says , " If you want to go fast , you go to the wind .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
The year last year at TED fecame an introduction in the LHC .
And I promise to get to the way to go back to how the machine works .
So here I did . And for those who no , the other time there were no , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever -- 27 miles of circuconference .
His task is to remember the conditions that were less than a billion in the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
It 's just environment .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
We 're photographs these mini-Big Bang in the remarkable .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- it 's 44 meters and has a 22 meters .
This is an ATLAS picture in building so you can see the proportions .
To September 10 September the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It 's unununmense festegy in control .
It 's a picture of the first phass that had done all the around the LHC , both CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCComs , and spreading particle particle physical physical physical physical picture , with a part of the LHC .
In other words , when we see that the 10 sunder the 10 tember tember , we realize that machine worked , which is a great vicicictory .
I don 't know if it was this to do exultent us more or this , when someone went on Google and saw that the beginning was this .
That means that we had a cultural impact beyond that scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , because it 's just to these dored flows here -- these dored dordered .
These flowers get 13,000 prints when the machine works at the maximum works .
Now , the technicians between you look at the flows and say , " It 's not true . It 's too much . "
And they can do that because when they 're very cool of become the supercondition of supercondition .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a temperature in the space between the stars , these flowing ss can bring that corrate .
In one of the guntures of the most novemile magnetic in the LHC , there was a fabbrication .
So the flows are a slightly , and the 13,000 printed printed , they met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , that 's even more impressive if you think these magnets more than 20 tons , and that are moved about 30 centimeters , and that have been moved about 30 centimeters .
You know , it 's about 50 magnetets .
We had to take them , what we had to do .
We 've repristined and enaged them .
Now , they 're going back all of their place .
I mean , the end of the hands of the LHC will be new integrath .
We 're going to accendered , and we 're going to get to the data to july , and we 're going to go so our adventure to discover what the matter of the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain quineering way , these accidents reaccess the dibate on the value of science and engineering in frontier . It 's easy to concentrate .
I think that the fact that 's so difficult , I think that 's the right right right now , I think this is the value of things like LHC .
I 'd like to end with the words of a English scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , imagine , in defense , in defense of his pupleasure , his pupleasure was Michael Faray , he said , " Nient is a very dangerous progress of the human mind , which is not measumphrey , that the ideas of science are not a new way that our worldwide , and that 's not in the world 's new worldwide . "
Thank you .
I want to start to start to ask you to think about when , from kids , you play with the morning .
And as you realive them and to get them and to get them and to get them , and learn them , learn in fact , learn to think and solve problems with problems .
The space reasoning is propattern to connected to the way we understand the world around us .
So , as a information information information as our physical interaction with my physicists , together to my consulation Patts , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking , " And if we use a computer , I started asking , " And if we use a computer , we can actually have the only current of a desktop of the digital poller , we could deal with a describe a describe a ,
and we sistemard-pleasure ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big computer computer interactive as a bunch .
In a few words , a Siftable is a big computer computer interactive as a bunch .
You can move them with hand , they can see it in their hand , you can see the movement and a radio screen and a radio radio radio .
But most of course , they 're physics , like the morning , you can just move it to just furners .
Siftable is of a new ecosystem of a new ecosystem to manipulate the digital information .
And as they get more physicists , conscious knowledge of the movement , of others , the other people 's movement , of the other people , how we move , we can explore new and different styles of interaction .
I 'm going to start with a few simple example .
This Siftable is configurned to show the video : if you 're in a direction , the video run will run back .
These interacts are consciously conscious .
If I running them , you 're interested in what they 're going to be around .
If they 're circumrounded , and they can act a little bit .
If they 're circumrounded , and they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power of data , the power of a liquid , like a color like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurated as a secity and I can use them to see color in that central color in that central , where they mixed .
and I can use them to put them in the color in that central , where they mix .
If we 're too , we can put a little bit of it .
It 's also beautiful possibility of learning , like languages , the mathematics and games where people can try and see the results of things , and see the results the results of the immediately .
Now , I 'm going to --
This is a Fibonaces that I do with a program of equations .
We have a game of words that 's half between Scarabean and Boggle .
Pratically , at every turn reminished a letter on every Siftable , Pratically , at every turn to a letter on every Siftable , and while you 're going to control him on a diption .
Then , after about 30 seconds of the remissing , and you have a new set of lective letter and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
This is the kids in the game at the Media Lab , I 've done it so that I 've been tried them and I turned a video video .
They 're very much .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people a lot of education .
You 've got to say , " Compones of the words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's how other people that try it .
This is our younger tester , there on the right .
It actually wanted to impact them .
They were just honces , for him .
Now , this is a cardboard of a cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for the languages of the languages is Felix .
It can inserious characters in the scene , solving Siftable , they can be in the scene of them .
It can inserious characters in the scene , solving Siftable , they can be in the scene of them .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is .
David Merrill : Now he brought a track in the scene .
Video : The arange treator .
I 'm doing it ! Yes !
So I school with the Siftable and put up neighbors can interact the characters --
Video : Well !
and by inventing their story .
Video : Hoo !
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him how it is .
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him how it is .
Video : Wat the cat .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool , that we 've made of realized , to figure out and exequals music .
It 's a tool , realized of recently , to walk and exececececures music .
Siftable here , they get from suund like base , based and the bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also get these sound in a sequence to buy your feet .
And it 's just to engage it just doing touch a " and a " sequence . "
These are actually , you can control from the vive , as the reverbs and the filter .
And it 's a particular sound and then including to enjoined it .
And then there are the general effects as time and fly , and fly , that you applicate the entire sequence .
We look at how it works .
Video : We 'll start to put a base in two Siftable , we 're going to put it into a series , we address it in a series , we add it , we add the base .
Now I put a basis of based .
Video : Now I add some percussions --
Video : And I 'll put the philtrue to the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the view .
Video : I can fast the whole sequence of the entire sequence inclinding the time by one side or another .
Video : And I 'm going to add the physics to the low to give more expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence " to fly . "
So I don 't have to plan it first , but I can improvise it , it 's longer or more short .
And now , finally , I can do not squence the entire sequence inclinating the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new interface , and more more more more more more than the machine and more sounds like our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this lost , and also a few possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmitted is that 's coming this new generation of objects for interact with the digital media , that will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writer .
I 'm writing books is my profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also the love and the fascine of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , he said this , something particular has happened in my life and my career , who took me to recently recently , I 've been to realibrate with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called Manogy , Prega , Ama , " which , " the one , diversity of my previous books , for some reason that world 's used in the world , and became a big sensationship ,
And the result is that everywhere go , people are going to me as if I was condanned .
It 's true -- condanned , condanned !
They 're going to me all worried and say , " Don 't have fear of the doing ?
You don 't have fear to continue to write for all life without able to be able to create a book that can important someone ?
What can important someone ?
It 's rassure , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a tremendous adolescent -- I was a writer .
I went to meet the same reaction of the same .
And people said , " Don 't the temes of it ?
Don 't you fear that the umiliation of killed you ?
You 're not going to be doing this mestive for all life without that nothing is ever outside and dead on a huge dreams of hundreds of hundreds of fallivate to fallival falycle ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I have fear of all those things .
I always had fear .
And I also fear of many other things that people can 't have to have to be able to inate .
As the algap and other things .
But , how about the I thought , and I was asked up what I thought , and I was going to be why ?
It 's rational ?
It 's a lot that everyone has to expect to be spent by a job that you can do .
But what is that 's so particular in the creative impress to make us nervous health of health health health , in a way that other career not do ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember of one time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he fear to be engineer ?
It wasn 't it -- that block of John , how do it ?
Don 't work that work , you know ?
Onests , the chemicals like group don 't have certainly , in the secoli , the reputation of being handle .
We have writers , we have enough this reputation , and not just writers , but creative to every gender , we have this reputation of being hustable mentally .
And it doesn 't know that look at the sad of the magnificent death of the magnificent death , just in the century , they died young and often them .
And the ones that are not suicipate data , they 're really dismiss from their dons .
Norman Mailer , before I die , in the last interview said , " Ogay my book has kill me a little bit more . " A extraordinary fermation about work .
But we don 't bad cils , when we feel saying because we 've heard these things , so long that we 've completely interiorized and accepted the notion that creativity and the notion that creativity and the art , it will always be able to be able to be able to be in the anscious .
And the question I want to take all of this idea is , you 're accord with this idea ?
It 's good to be good for it , because he looks at a centimeter , it 's not good for anything to be good for anything this supposed .
I think it 's hate .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated century .
I think it 's better encourage our big creative minds to live .
And of course , I know that , in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start at that hear that I was in my own career , especially , I 'm in my career .
That is -- you know , I 'm just looking at , I 'm young , I 've got about 40 years .
I 've still got about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that anything write right now , it 's going to be jobs in the world as the work that was used to be jobs , and I was going to be jobs .
I 'm going to be slavery , because we 're all more or less friends here -- is likely that my biggest success to my shoulder .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the gender of thinking that leads a person to start to get gin the nine of the brings of the nine and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep to continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how to ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflections , that the way to work to keep write is to create a putt purpose , right ?
I have to have a few way to find a security between me , which I 'm write , and my natural anxiety on what reaction will get . And as I was trying to do this , and as I was trying to look through the time , trying to see other societies to see if they could have the best ideas and more healthier ideas and more healthier .
in how to help people create creative to manage the inherent inherent emotions .
And that research has led me to the ancient Great Rome .
Sewitem because yes , and then back .
In the Great Rome and ancient Rome -- people don 't seem to believe that creativity from men , OK ?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit is that they 're looking at the becomes to the men , and unknown , and unknown , and unknown ,
The greeeeeched these spirits are about the creativity of the creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , he created a demone that elargives wisdom from the wisdom .
The Romands were the same idea , but they call that spirit species of a genius .
That 's great , because the Romanes don 't really think that a genius was really an genius .
And they realive that a genius was this kind of entities that created in the walls of a study of a artist , a little bit like the Dobby , and that came out to see the work of the artist and the result of that work .
Except -- here , that 's the distance of which I talk about -- that putt pitself from the results of your work .
And everyone who had that was so that he worked , right ?
So the antients were protected by certain things , like the narcissism , for example , not ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn 't take all the goods , all of the goods , all of the people who had been helped by this genius .
If your failure work , it wasn 't all your collide , right ?
And they all knew that was your genius to be a inable .
And so people han concept in the West , for a long time .
Then the Renascivvvance came up and all this big idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe of the universe , and no more leaving space to the misters and more without leaving space to the devinity .
This was the main of the rational human rational and people started thinking about that creativity was completely by the ishared .
And for the first time in history , I started to referiring to this or that artist as a rather as a rather than a person in the person .
And I must tell you , I think it was a big herror .
I think that allow someone , a simple person to create as a recipient as a recipient as the source , the beautiful and the source of all the divines of all the divines of a too big , to be a very large , to be as a very large file to give the fragile human separate .
It 's like to inguiate the sun .
Deform and behind all these inextremely inextremely expectable on the performance .
And I think it was this pressure to address the artists in the past 500 years .
And , if that 's true , and I think it 's the question , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe back to a more address of the relationship between humans and mistery .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can 't cancer 500 years of thinking in a 18 minutes .
And probably there is people between the audience that would sollevered to scientific notion , in the notion of the notion , you know , you know , you know , you know , they follow the people who are spected to be .
I 'm probably not going to convince you all of this thing .
But the question I 'd like to take is -- why not ?
Why not think that way ?
Because it 's more sense of everything that ever ever heard to explain the exasperformance of the process of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever , basically , all here -- it doesn 't understand it .
And , in fact , it can sometimes completely paranormal .
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poetesh , which has 90 years , but it 's a poetesh for the whole life , but that was a poetesh for the Virginia , working out in the Virginia , working out in the Virginia , and he heard it , in the poeth .
He said he was like a fragorous labor of the air .
And that was rotate to the landscape .
It was to hear , because he was so much a tremendous feet .
He knew to have a only thing to do at that point and it was , his words like a map . "
And so it goes to house and came out of this poetry , and it wouldn 't have to make another piece of a paper and a match of paper , and a math math , and he would collect it and rare it on the page .
Sometimes he could not be fast , so he would be fast , and he goes and he running and he would go to the home and her and he would go to the home and her losed and her and he would keep to rotolate through the landscape , and he said , " another one . "
Then there were those times -- this piece of the time , I would never forget -- there were moments where the stairs of it was almost losing , right ?
So , he was running up with the house and and was trying to be looking for the card and the poem was a critical cutter in the way , and then he said , that was like , and then he said , that was like , he was like to hand the floor and the further .
He had the poem of the tail and he was put it in his body and turned it on his body page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page , but the last word .
So when I thought , I was a crazy , it 's exactly the same process .
Not all of my creative process -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a music , and my way to work is , and I can see up to the same orary every day and to work and go and go and go and step and go and go and go and go and go and step and go and go and step and go and step and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and step and step and step and go to go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and step and step and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go
But even I , in my head , I have stripped against that thing , sometimes .
And I imagine that a lot of you do the han done .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source I could not honestly saw it .
And what is this thing is ?
And how can we relationate to it so that we don 't get to lose the head , but , rather , rather , that make us remain ?
And as I look at it , the best example of the contemporary example I have is the Tom Waits , which I interviewed a day day day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of the life of the life has been the incarnation of the artist 's recorded in the artist 's remarkable , to manage , to reach these species of creative totally interized these species of interified .
But then I 'm invited , he went up , and one day as he was driving on a car in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
It was going to go fast and all of a tract tract this little framment of melody , which comes into his head as he does the inspiration , elusive and the wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and it doesn 't know how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a math , it has a core register .
So he begins to hear this species of old anxium , and I 'm going to lose it , and I 'll be obsessionally brought by this song .
I 'm not very good and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go in the panic , it was stopped .
I 'm going to do the entire process and made something completely new .
I 'm going to look at the sky and said , " Scuses , not see I 'm driving ? "
" You know , it seems that can write a song ?
If you really want to be , you get back to a more opporting time when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , I walked to get any other today .
You can see Leonard Cohen . "
And his work was working on changed after this .
I don 't work , the work was still dark like .
But the process , and the fish anxiety that was returned when the genius , the genius that was cause when he was cause , and he was re-flew back where it was , he remained by that he had to be an interiorized , and he remained .
but yes , that 's wonderful , beautiful , beautiful collaboration between Tom and this strange , and this strange , and external that it was not Tom .
So how much the story I was going to change a little bit also how I worked and already to go on .
This idea , I wrote when I was writing " Manogy , Prega , Ama , and fall in one of those cave dispersonally when we 're working on something and we can 't start thinking that and we can 't start thinking that and we can 't start thinking that it 's going to be a disaster , which is going to be a disaster , which is going to be disaster .
Not just bad , just the worst book .
And I started thinking about gunning this project .
But then I remember Tom that talked about the air and I tried us .
So I got up my face in the handed of my handing to the handle of the room .
And I said , " Are , " Sinds , what do we know that this won 't be brilliant , it 's not going to be indeed with my , no ?
Because as you see , I 'm putting all I 'm putting with this .
So if you want to be better , you have to give you better , and make your part .
OK . But if you don 't know what , you know what it 's not about it .
I 'm going to try to write the same because it 's my work .
And I want to do for me that I 'm going to do my part of this today , I 'm showed to do my part of the North the deserts of the North people in North the deserts of the slon of the slon , dances and music that they were going on for hours and hours .
And they always were magnificent , because the ballerini were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every time , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually transpendent .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've seen it all , at a certain point , a performance so .
It was like the time stops , and the dancerin the wald walked through a kind of a bral brings , and he wasn 't doing anything else from the usual , but all of it was moved .
And to suddenly not appears like a human .
But it 's going to be accinated in the fire of the divinity of the divinity .
And when this was going to be , in the time , people knew what was called it .
And they had the hands and started cancer , and they started cancer , Allah , God , God , God , " God , " God , " God , " God . "
That 's God , you know .
And I realized the stories -- when More invading the south of the South , I was this habits and the pronunce changed in the secoli of " Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , " that you can hear in the run .
In Spain , when a artist has done something impossible and magical , " Allah , the , the magical , " Allah , " I was a good , " ununderstood , " ununderstanding of God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But the problem is the day after , for the ballerin the day , when you wake up and discover that they 're the 11 of the morning of Martedyes , and I wouldn 't have it .
It 's just a mortal with a mortal with ginoccurred to the ginoccurred .
And perhaps no one cancer 's name of God still as it gets , and what does it have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painction recognizations to make in a creative life .
But perhaps not must be so angoscientist , if you can 't believe , in fact , the most extraordinary aspects of your being from yourself .
But you just believe that they 're going to you to have a very unimaginable source of this squisite of your life that you have to get to someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think about that all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly as I thought about it for different months in the work of the book that I 'm going to publishing , I 'm going to do , spent , I 'm going to be following up in my great success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel elected by this is , not having fear .
Don 't flew . It 's just your work .
It 's inua to inua part of your part , any way to be .
If your job is balling , bad .
If the divine , absurd genius to leave some kind of wonder , for a moment to give a few kind of wonder , for just a moment through your forced and force , " Ole ! "
Otherwise , I do the same .
And " Ole ! " You know , you know ,
I think , and I think it 's got to teach it .
" Ole ! " Are you , even only to get a huge , and tals to get you to get you continued .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
You know , I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what is significant to new set of genes .
Now we 're starting to start a new pattern : We started digitalizing biology and now to start to start with that digital code , we 're going to get into a new biology , design and synthesizing life .
We 've always tried to bring big questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that a lot of biologists have a lot of lifetime .
We tried different approaches , reduced to the terms .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome , they were treated to go from the analogical world of the computer world .
Now we 're asking : We can regenerate life , or new from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest genitalium of those that can autorem in the lab .
And we tried to reduce ulteriorable genome to create a little more smaller .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of the 500 that are here .
But when we give a look at his map , it 's relatively simple , it 's relatively simple than our .
I redetection , that 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , is very improbable that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only way the only way to provide this cromosome way to get mosome of these cromosome of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the " Can we synthesize a cromosome of the cromosome ? "
It can be the chemicals to produce these great molecules that we never ever ever do we have to create before we 're going to create before ?
And in case , we can make a cromosome of mosome ?
A chemist is simply a chemist of chemical material .
The speed that we are able to digitalize the life is growing up to exponential exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead of prodiscuss , but it 's better .
And our most recently recently recently , the exponential curve .
We 've started more than 15 years ago .
The process has required a lot of passes , beginning with a bioetic review before we started the first experiments .
But we found that synthesize that DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that producing small segments of DNA , the long , the letter is a degenerative process : more the segment is a degenerative process : the more than the segment is , more herrors .
So we had to develop a new method to assembly these framments and correct the herrors .
And this is our first tentative attempt , to start to start with the digital genome of Phi X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kill batters .
We designed the fragments , actually , actually the correction of herrors and get a molecule of DNA 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material , and we put it in the bacteria , and we put it into the bacteria , and then we put it into this genetic code and proud to make the viral particles .
The viral particle viral particle , then they 're back back and they 're back and destroyed the Elay .
I 've been talking about recently the recently oil industry , and they 're going to be able to be understood that they have certainly compress this .
They 've got more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build the same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in larger .
We wanted to build the entire cromosome of the bacteria .
It 's more than 580 miles of genetic code .
So we thought we 're going to build it in seven of the viruses , so that we can change the seven of the viruses of a living cells .
The crucial design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequencyourself , we 're going to the first time in 1995 , the standard accuratess was a mile for every 10 miles .
We discovered , resequency , 30 mistakes . If we used that original sequence , we would never be able to be able to do it work .
One part of the process is designing for 50 letter letter that we have to have all the other segments of 50 letter to build smaller underunity , to build smaller underunity , working together .
We try to do the only one of the only one here .
You probably have read a lot of reading that we put in the filighter .
Think of that : We have a genetic code on four letters , C , G and T.
Three of those readers men together codify about 20 friendly , and there 's a specific order to each amount of reading .
So we can use genetic code to write words , framework , frames .
What we 've done in the beginning was autography .
And some of them have been in the fact that it wasn 't a poem .
We designed these segments to just unire them to unire them .
There are encyourself that repair them and put them together .
And we started assemble to assemble parts , beginning with segments from five to segments , and to make it segments of 24 miles , until the way to get to get 72 of the letter .
We have made these sequences in abundance , so that we 're trying to see that we 're trying to create a very very robad process -- you 'll see a minute .
We 're trying to automatizing the process .
So , this seems the tabellon of a basket playoff .
When we get to these very long , much longer segments , more than 100 mila , they 're not going to grow more directly in the Ecoli .
You get to the modern limit of the modern molecular biology .
So we 've been looking at other mechanisms .
We knew , we had another mechanism called the homologa , which in biology to repair the DNA can une the DNA can unire segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , can absorb three million rad of radiation .
You can see in the superior as his chromosome of the suddenly bad comes destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly like it was before .
They have thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms are completely to be completely .
They can live under a vacuum .
I 'm absolutely certainly that life exists in space , and you can find new environments of water .
And in fact , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built these processes , just using these processes , just using the segments of the segments to insert .
The evidence is assemble .
This image was not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It 's a molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the published we 've done a little time ago .
It 's more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a definitely defined structure .
It 's a molecular weight to 300 million .
If we stammed with a 10 without spaces , you would like 142 pages , you would just take 142 pages , you would just take this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ?
Of course , you love a virus is a game of kids .
It 's a little more complicated when they use the bacteria .
It 's also simpler when it 's ekariote as our ekariote as our : you can just extract the nucleus and put another , which is basically the clonation of clonation .
In the archaea , the archaea is integrated instead of integrated in the cell , but we 've recently showed that we can do a transplant transplant of a cell and to activate it .
We can refected a cromosome of a microbial species .
The two are different than men of the men .
We added some gene genes in more way that you could decide what choose for this cromosome .
And then the sciolden with the ends in a way to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was stupending -- and you 'll oppreciate our sophisticatooos -- the new cromosome , the new cell .
And we thought we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried anyway , but we 've tried to go out there .
This is one of the majors mechanisms of evolution .
We found that a lot of species have added a second or a third cromosome of a cromosome of new tracks of that species .
So who think about evolution as only gene to evolution as a gene to understand the biology .
And they 're also called me restription is that it 's going to be able to make DNA .
The cromosome that was in the cells , not one .
The cell cell cell that we put it up .
And it 's expressed , and he recognized the other cromosome as an material , has the masticate , and we were returned with just the cell and the new cell cell and the new cromosome .
It became blue because of the genes we put .
And in a short leave of time , all the characteristics of a species have been going to be allowed in a new species , based on the new species , based on the new software that we put in in the cells .
Everything proteins are changed , membranes are changed , and when we read the genetic code of the exactly of what we 've been transfer .
Now , this may seem alchemy genetic , but by horing DNA software , we can change things in a pretty basically basically basically .
Now , I 've already explained that here is not talking about genesis -- but to start to start with three and a half million years of evolution , and I 've said that we 're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian , where they will be created on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty obvious when we think of our needs .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right for example : I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each existence in 1946 , there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean and clean and gasoline , and a half billion people .
It 's even more detection to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion coal , more than 30 billion baries of the olium .
That means a million baries a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to reduce them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to have to hold all the whole emission of the CO2 of these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
And today , thanks to scientific discoveries in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the components for the future .
The electritric electric , just a dozen about a dozen of a components , and think how many different things came out .
Our limits here are principlally the data from our imagination and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , thanks to these metods of synthesization , that we call combinatory .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million cromosome a million cromosome a day .
Think of these 20 million genes or different genes , or to try to get optimizing , and new vaccines , new vaccines , new vaccines , and we can change , thank more biology , and create more molecular biology , and create more molecular biology .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for a chance of survival , production , chemical , production of the chemical , production of etc ,
This is an instantaneous instantaneously a few software that we 're working for being able to seat and design species in the computer .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how they 'll be .
We know exactly what the genetic code .
We 're going to focus on the fuel of how generation .
You also saw you who have to extract ethanol from the gran experiment .
We have fuel of second and third generation that will use enough to sugar fuel , as much as much as the opt-value , or different types of butanol .
But the only way biology that biology can have a great impact with more impact than the cost of food and limitate the cost of the food and limitate the CO2 in matter , which we 're working on to design cells that we work to work for cells that can reach this , and we think of power that , and we think of that , and we think of the first generation in about 18 months .
The solar light sunlight , but in our discoveries , but in our discoveries around the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the ocean , about 2500 feet of depth of ebolliance at the temperature of the water .
They reat the CO2 of the CO2 of the energy , and we 're using hydrogen energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can meaning the CO2 , which can actually be transported by the tubes , convert that CO2 in the middle , to drive this process .
So , we think we might be able to increase what we can increase what the basic question is , what is the question of what life is Nice , versus -- we have the goal of the entire industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where can you do it from TED , where can you ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And also , we 're working on for using the same metods to create vaccines .
You saw this year with the influence , we 're always back to a year and with a year with a dollar in less when it 's a couple of the right .
I think that that you can change by construction .
This is how the future could start to start to look at changing , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating the synthetic evolution with synthetic bacteria .
We 're in a lot of the best people .
Our purpose is to do a long time to try and try and try to get it . Thank you very much .
I can do all see , I 'll show you , the most faster possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we 've been taken to the Microsoft , in the way , it 's Seadragon .
It 's a environment that you can interact with a huge amount of data .
We 're seeing a lot of digital gigabyte picture with a species of zoom and continuous quoes , and a fast , disponing , disponing the images of how we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these pictures are the data or the images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this is a scanning scanning from the Biooooeca of Congress , and reenter in the gamma of 300 megapixel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that is that limit to just just a system like this is the number of playel on your screen on any time . It 's an architecture very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not not images .
This is the Dickens of Dickens . Every colonna represents a hat .
And to show you that it 's just about tree , and we can 't do something like images , to make a really really look at that it 's a real representation of the text , not a picture of the text , not a picture of the text , not a picture of the text , not a picture of the text , not a picture of the text , you can actually do something like that , to be able to see that it 's a real thing of images , we can actually do something like that .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little electronic book .
I don 't have to be advice .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the Guardian .
Every big image is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and beautiful experience of a cartoon , or a quote , or a quotidian , which is for nature , which is a moltle of a half .
We also did something with the corner of this number in particular number of the Guardian .
We created a higher advertising , higher than what you use in a normal advertising -- and it 's a published published -- and we put you in the extra .
If you want to see the cards of this automobile , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the space of space on the screen .
We hope that that means that that that means to put up to the pop-up and other parts like the gries , not to be necessary .
Naturally , the mapplications is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not losing time , if we don 't want to say that we have contributs to giving this field .
These are all the streets in the United States . It 's a geospace in the U.S.
So we 're going to go to something else .
This is actually actually in the wildly vive , you can go to the web ; you can go see it .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual computer at the other one of the University of Washington of Washington of Washington Steve Szeliski University of Rick Szeliski U.S. . " Oottic . " Oottttic .
And it 's from Seadragon the web , gestion .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from an image to the other and have this kind of experience .
But the space of the images of the images here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization of the computer have recorded these images together , so that they correspond to the real place where the images -- all of the scale of the Rocococcauses in the Rococcial Montagne Roctopped -- and they 're taken . So , you can see the elements of a slightly -- or imaging , these things are all the space space space .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noahhahs -- and this is from a prototype of Photosynth that we 've done for the first time , you can work for the first time , you can actually work for the first time , the Photosympth , technology Photosympth . And it 's not necessarily , looking at the environments that we put in the web .
We had to worry about legal laws and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame images from Flickr , and you get Notre Notre in Flickr and you get images of the types of the maglights , other campus and so on . Each of these arcions of these arcions , and so on .
So , they 're all picked up from Flickr and have been all linked to be able to be in this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this way simply .
You know , I would never have thought I 'm not going to think of the end to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying to get this kind of acadow here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different types of different fields of phones that are in the phones , SLR , a number significant number of SLR , a meaning number .
And if I can get to try to try to be those strange .
And a lot of them are blocked by doing , etc .
You have a few part here is a series of photographs -- here .
This is a Notre of Dame recorrectly correctly .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do with the social environment . This is now taking data from the entire memory of how to appear the ground , from visual view -- and collective all those data together .
All those pictures become linked together , the major of the parts .
You have a model of the earth that emergence .
Think about this as a proling of Stephen Lawler on the War Lawler on the War .
It 's something that growing up in complexity as a hand that people use it , and the advantages for the use of the use .
Their picture are hamed with measured , and they put in the people .
If someone is the idea of the idea of these things to meet all these things , my picture of Notre catthedral chthedral chthedral chthedral to all those data , and I can use the way of all these data , and I can use the way of all these data in space , using the photographs of everyone else , and have a cut of a cross-mobile photographs .
Of course , a consequence of all this is virtual model of every interesting part of the earth , and collective , not just to be able to be airplane and satellitarian images and similar images and similar , but from the college memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understood ? What your software going to do is that a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs , all the photographs , all the photographs , they 're going to be connected together ?
BAA : Yes . What 's doing is basically discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the basis in the base of images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think of the security of the semantable information that a lot of these images are able to be .
As you make a research of images on the web , and the text of a srase and the text on the web page of the picture .
Now , what happens if that picture is connecting all your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection and semantic and the amount of rechezes that is really huge . It 's a very large classic effect .
CA : Blaise , it 's incredible .
BAA : So thank you very much .
One of the main pipes when you travel and one of the research of the ethnographics of the research that doesn 't forget the anti-traditions , between the wind , the steel of the past , the wind , the wind , the wards of the plants , warehouse , wards the leaves of plants .
And the idea that Jaguar travel even even the Lattea , and the idea that the Milthea , or that the Inuit 's still , and Himalayas , the good as Himalayas , the good degree , to remember the important of the Dharma , to remember the the important of the Dharma , to remember the central anthropology , but it 's just a model is just a model of fact ,
The consequence of a particular set of choices that our strops has done , good or a lot of generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
We all have . We all try .
We are subjects at the beginning .
We need to deal with the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprising and ballize .
We all have art .
What it hits is the particular rhythm of the song of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they 're the Penan ants of the Borneo , or the following of Haiti , or the Haiti 's warriers , or the Kaisut 's Kaisut in Kenya , or a cammouth in the Sahara camera in the Sahara camera .
He was my companion of journey in the desert a month ago , or a huge of the hyak , in the Everest , the mother of the world .
All of these people are teaching us that there are other ways of exists to think , other ways of thinking , other ways of mods in the world .
And if you reflect a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
Insian cultures of the world 's cultures , a ragnature of the world 's life and cultual lifts that flight on the planet and is important to the well-being of the planet as the ragela .
And you can think about this ragela cultural ethnosphhere and you can defining the ethnosphere and you can defining the total of all the concepts , dreams , hundreds , ideas , inspirations , inspirations ,
The ethnosphhere is the patrimonium of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be as a species .
And because the biosphere was free . It was a very quickly consumed to ethnosphhere and much much more quickly .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species has been on the orethe hority of the extinction , because it 's false -- or in the most optimistic extinction -- and you don 't have close to the most optimistic , that 's also more optimistic than all the diversity of the diversity of cultural diversity .
The index of all that is , of course , the language .
When you 're born about 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just composed to a vocabulary or from a series of rules .
A language is the shadow of the human spirit .
It 's the midddle of every culture is coming in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a backycle , a spiritual chance .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we 're sitting here at Monterey , at least half is not more surrounded in the ears of children .
They don 't get more teached to kids , which means , unless , not figure out , which is already dead .
What is more sad than being the sad of the being that is the last silence , to be the last to talk to a language , not to have to transmit the wisdom of the children ?
This remember is the someone in some part of the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks are a motor and brings with it in the last syllabs .
And I know somebody who will say , " Isn 't it better like that ?
The world would not be a better place if we talk about all the same language ? " Well , we talk about all yorba . We talk about cancer .
We talk kogs .
You 'll cover a tract of a tract thing means not to talk about his language .
I would like to do a journey through the ethnosphere .
a little journey in the ethnosphhere to give you a little bit of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of exists , " I mean , " I mean , " I mean , " I mean , " You know , " I mean , "
We take for example this baby Barasana , in Amazon , the Amazon , the sacred of the anaconda , which creatt at the middle of the sacred of the sacred of the sacred pattern in the sacred of the sacred pacred pacred .
It 's a popular popular that 's not able to distinguish the blue because the mobile of the green because the forest is identified in the forest , which depends the popular .
They have a strange language and a main language , detection of the language , " You have to have a very different language .
And it all radical past , in the past of the Mitological past , is that in these exists that are in these exists in these familiar familiar , because of the matrimons of mysts , no one of the matrimons .
They 're all all the time to listening and then start to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I 've lived , the Waorani Worani Ecuador , a popular popular popular that has had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionaries have been tented a common .
They 've done by the high photographs that had been taking them in a few who had been adichevolved , forest that this population of the pluvial forest .
They 've got the picture of the earth , they 've turned to the research of a form or a figure and , not in the way , they have concluded that it was a deal with the lance .
But the Waorani don 't only kill the straneiers .
They kill in their own .
The 54 percent of the mortality was caused by the same .
We 're rising at eight generations and we found two cases of the natural death and when we store to know , they have a mess that one of them was invited so that he died , and then they kill it the same .
The crawings were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early 1980s , I was assigned a very interesting task when my professor of Harvard ases , I wanted to go to Haiti in the early , I was assigned in the secret of Duvalier and Tonton Macoues and the Macoues , and impossessing me of the speaking of the speed of the speed of the speed of the speed of the Duvalier , and imself .
To give a sense of miraculous , I should understand the Vodoun culture and that Vodoun and that Vodoo is not magnine .
It 's pretty much of a complex metaphysics of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddddismo , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has not have been religious phan-Saharan Africa has no other than the distilled distillate of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts that 's tragic , in the slavery .
What makes the voodos is the intense relationship between life and death .
So the people are going to be born the spirits .
The spirits can be invited by the Great Acqua , the replaced of dance and replace temporary and they replace temporary to the anim of the vive way that for a short , and it 's a very ,
So the voodooists , they say , " You can go white white the living of God .
We say in the temple and divention the temple and divention . "
And from the moment that you are , is the spirit that you 're driving you , how can you do that ?
So you 're looking at these incredible events : follow voodos in the state of trance that touch in the body that touch a rather stronger demonstration .
And at all the people who have lived the most amazing people are Kogi Kogi Nevada in Sierra Nevada in Sierra Nevada Colombia in Colombia .
It 's an antician of civilization , that once they live the load planning of the Colombial in the tacks of the Colombia , the popular popular makes .
In a macy of blood , this popular , this popular was never conquired by the spages .
And now , they have governed by a clero , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people follow out of the family three or four years , and they live in a very good world and secregated in a world that is good homes and hit in a world that 's made of floor at at the glaciers for 18 years .
Two days of nine years of proposed to reproduce the nine months of gestation that turn into the user of the mother , they 're metaphically in the user of the Great Mther .
So , all of the time , they get accultural values of their society , values that they predict their precies and just their own holds , or to say the cost equilibrium .
At the term of this incredible beginning , they 're improvisly taken out and for the first time in life , in their age , at the age of 18 years , they see a tremendous . And in that account of the first cut , when the sun of the beautiful cuts , everything that learned out of the beautiful landscape , all his splay . The preciate is going to go back and says ,
" I 'm going to do how I said .
It 's amazing . It 's now to you protect it . "
They 're called the major brothers and say that we , the minors , we 're the colate collies of the world .
This is an intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the Ingene and environment , we 're in the environment , and the old old story of the noble wildlife , which is a razy concept in his simplicity or maybe invoices and say that these people are closer to the neighborhood of us .
The Indigenes are not sentimental feeling , or unbolites from the nostalogy .
There 's no space for these things in the paluds of the Astststage , or the gelids of the Tibet , but thank you , they created a mistic mistics of the Earth 's based , but on a bunch of the world 's not on a baluges .
What does it mean ?
It 's a kind of message that growing boy , which is a beautiful humans is a spirit of the Apu that he will drit its destiny will be a different human destiny , and it will have a very different relationship with the mountain or that place in the Montana , who grew up with a mouse , and it 's going to be scale .
That 's the dimour of a spirit or a mineral canderal candle .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the way that defines the relationship between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Britannica Britannica credating that the forests service to be cut .
That made me a human being in a human being from my friends Kwakiutl that believe that the forests are the Hukukuk and the stories of the paradies and the stories of the paradies that live in the northern world , spirits that are in the northern world , exploring during the Hamately .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of them sensationally , you can get this plant .
I took this picture to open in the northern Amazon the northern Amazon .
Mayahuash some of you have heard of the ayahuash , the most powerful substance of the sciamanic repertoilet .
What makes the playahuash is not the physics is not the potential of the sustainance , but its elements . It 's two elements .
It 's a hand , this leave leg , this lian under a series of betacarboline , harmine , a lot of hallucinogenes .
And by making the solving plant , you have a blue that it 's a little bit of consciousness , but it 's misceled with the leaves of a family said , " The Psychotria .
This plant contains tripamines , very similar to the serotonin the smootthoxyltryltryltryltrypamines .
If you 're ever going to see the Yanomami , you 'll see the nass that make a different species of species , anched methoxyltryltrypamine .
Are that polly-s-up is a little bit like being spared by a fire smoke , and then in a dead of putting pattern and landing on a mare of electricity . It doesn 't create a destortion of reality .
I had often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who 's brought the psychedelic , with his discovery of the fungy of the Mexico .
I think of my tesis , you can 't be to be able to be able to be . Because if you 're not told , because if you 're not told , you can 't tell one of being holding . And the tripsts , they can 't be assumped because they 're really , they 're money from a very , because they 're really , in the inforesty , detection of the world , detection .
It 's possible to do them just as a little bit of the chemicals that money is going to be in the MAO .
Now it 's the beautiful : the beta-carboline , which is injuana are injur , the same kind of need to be able to be able to be able to be tripamines . The question is spontaneously , how these are not , but that if you combine two death death , but if you combine two death death , but if you combine it 's sumer to the sound ?
We use the great euit of prove and the error of the prove and error , that can reveal .
But if we asked the Indians , they 'll tell us , " The plants are talking . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuash , which are unguys in the forest , and that our eyes would be in the forest species .
If we asked him how they 're going to stay their tasonomy , will tell us , " I thought of plants , I don 't know all the way , I don 't know . "
The solution is : you take the 17 varieties in a night night of a moon and each night with a different tone .
And that doesn 't have a car at Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that contate the stami .
Now , there 's a problem that also is that the ones of us who have heart heart people have in ingenes , but somehow reduced you get them in the handing of the history of our story , and it 's going to be in our real world , and it 's going to be in our real world , and it 's going to beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it will not reminded for his wars or its innovations , but rather like the early that we stopped and we have been huge , and we have burn , and we have burn , in fact , the problem of course , it 's not the problem of the biological diversity and cultural cultural diversity of the planet .
Everything 's cultures through the seccoli have been involved in a dance for new chance of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians have no stopped to be Sioux when they put out of the areas and fall so as the Americans have no stop being Americans when they put out caval and hot .
It 's not the change or technology that thnosphhere . It 's the power of the ethnosphhere .
The flight flight of the domination .
And if you look at the world , you 'll find that these are not cultures are not cultures to disappear .
They 're creatures and dynamics and dynamics , that 's an identify that they go beyond their adaptation .
And that 's the disboscaring in the patria of the Penan ,
a popular named Sarak , in the Sarak , in the Southeast Asian popular who lived on the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to the service and prostitution on the reverse of the rive reverse , where you can see the flowing of the rivers of the rive Borneo in the Merierishares , where the navelages , where the horizon-horizonesis , where the horizonce the hord of the horizon-horse ,
It takes the stage of the wood to the forest .
Or in the case of the Yanomami , are the diseases that are coming with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard of political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physics of a popular , is condanned to the universal lifetnocide , but the ethnocide destruction of a population , not just is conditive , but it 's not just condent , but it 's a burn of the development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet until you can 't understand the Tibet until you 're going to the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in the Western China through Tibet Souoriental Tibet , and in Lhasa young message , but just came to Lhasa young hasa young hasa , I realized what we feel about .
6,000 sacres sacred to polls and cenhing .
1.2 million people kill by the military during the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was absolutely ascritical .
which means that it 's been kill to be kill the templates of the Chinese invasion .
And in the uncrowed with Sua Sanity during the diaspora that has bring the popular in Nepal .
His mother been impresoned and his colliages was to be rich .
It was brought to hidden in the age of two years hidden under his leg because he could not live without him .
The sister , which made the same , was put in the same , was put in reeducation .
One day has been walked up a drive fashion Mao and , and that transgression , is put the works of the works for seven years .
The pain of Tibet can be insopurable , but the spirit of the population is from the present .
And then , all of the fin , all of it reduce .
We want to live in the world of the monoromatic , or we want to account the policymatic diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before I die was that his greatest pture was that , in our own pattern of the world , we 're not only going to see the entire gamma of human imagination to a limitation of human imagination , but one day we 'll swake up from a sleep , but one day we 'll sleep from a sonymellow us .
And it 's umiliating our species is for 60,000 years .
The Neolitical volution , who given us the agriculture , which made us to have a cult cult , and replacing the seed poetry , and we 're talking about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industrialized has been 300 years .
That several story not suggests that we have the answers that we have the answers that we 're going to all the slope .
When these mirid-and-a-to-clearly , what is to say to be human , " They respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that all rises we 're all risky , we 're going to be what we are : a conscious species , that has to make all the garden of the garden can truly truly . And there are great ways of eight-mism moments .
I took this picture on the northern of the island of the Baffin , when I went to hunt hunt , when I went to the hundrea of the hundrea story of his grandfather .
The government canadis not always gentle to be gentle with the Inuit and 50 to stage our sought , we 've got them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refuted to go .
The family , I 'm told for his life , and brought him all his remained .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't have the cold , the framework .
The sledwildlife in original were made of fish flight in the skin .
The grandfather than this man didn 't intimise from the artics or from the library , who was suffering .
It 's gathering away , and it 's hot the pantalone , and defected in your hand . When the fecame in your hand . When the phyes are congelated , and you 've worked it .
He sprined on the talive of this cut , and when I became solid , he kill a dog .
He wasn 't the dog and created a bridle , with the cash , and he created a sleth-created sleth-handed , and it 's disappeared on the banknaps .
We want to talk about cavarsely with nothing ?
In the 1999 government , the canad-sold government , the total control of a territory area of the larger California and Texas the Moung together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's a Independent terrible . They all the minerary resources .
One splendido of how a nation-state can remember with his people .
And , to finish , I think it 's quite obvious at least who of us was in these remote zones of the planet , remote that they 're not in remote .
For someone is home .
They represent of the human imagination that are rising at the high of the time . And for us all , the dreams of these kids , as the dreams of our kids , become part of the hope .
And in the finish , we 're convinced to the Geographic , we convinced political to get anything .
We believe that polemies --
[ Applauses are not persuasive , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell stories of the world . Each mitting the world 's 35 million lived .
156 countries transmit our television .
Our reviols are laughters of millions of people .
Our work is travel in the ethnosphere to bring our audience in which is travel that they 'll go out out out of how they 've seen , and hopefully , they 'll be huge , they 'll braced in the central anthropology : the world 's deserve to existing in the different , and we have to find a life in a midddle and multicultural world
where the wisdom of all the people can contributing to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I wrote in this book that I hope you 've already heard and try to evidence some links , in case not them .
I want to start with what I call " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " "
The official dogma official dogma of what ?
The official dogma of all societies of the Western societies . The dogma is the free of our citizens . "
The reason is , from a side , in the fact that freedom is in the same a value , it 's precious , useful , behaviors for humans .
And in the other is that if we 're free , each of us can act for all that we can act for all our well-being , without any one that decide in our well-being , without any one that decide in our name .
The way to massive freedom is massive freedom .
The more choices people have , more than people are free , and greater is their liberty , more is their benefit .
This , I think , it 's so propattern in society that no one would dreams of the society that no one would dream .
And it 's also deeply radical in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some of the examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly great .
I 'm a simple note about conditions for injumped .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditive , without content 10 , and 12 , and the 12 of the balsamic aceages that you can buy to do a huge number of constantly constantly in the 175 , already , and that no one of the 175 already ready ready ,
That 's what supermarket is supermarket .
Then you go to the electronics to buy a stereo stereo , CD , lector , radio , radio , plag , piag .
And in this single negoties of electronics , there 's a great number of audio components .
We can do six and a half million different combinations using the components that there are just a store .
You need to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Others , the world of the communications .
Once I was a child , they could get all the desire , they could get all the desire , and they were forniture that they were forned by the mom Bell .
You were giving the phone , you wouldn 't buy it .
One consequence of that , between the other , was that the telephone never break .
These days have gone .
We have a variety of the phones , especially between the phones .
Here 's the future of the future .
My favorite , is the MP3 , topels of the nass , and the burn of the nass , and the burn for the crustulum .
If you don 't even seen it in the negotie under the house , you 're going to get some of them .
And what happens is that people enter in the negoties and does this question . And you know what the answer is ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't make things too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the acquired of the aquences of the living of choices .
Auseence healthcare : it doesn 't happen in the United States , which you have to go out and the doctor , you have to do .
Instead , I won the doctor , and the doctor says , " Okay , we could do . Ar , or B " has these benefits and these " B " has these benefits and these risks " B " has these benefits and these risks . What does it do you do ? "
You say , " Dr. "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , and these risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you can rebats , " Dr. if she was me , what would do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not her . "
The result of the malate of the malate , expression that makes it seemed it looks like a beautiful thing .
But it 's actually not that a moving the fish and responsibility of the taking for someone that something , which is , to someone else that nothing -- and almost certainly , it 's not in the ideal condition to take the real patient .
There 's a huge marketing of drueutical products , direct people like me and you , that if you think about it doesn 't make sense , because we can 't buy it .
But if we can 't buy them , why do you get publishing them ?
The answer is that they want to do it for doctor to ask them to do it recipe .
What 's the fundamental as our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this vision , as you see in this vignetal vignetity , we don 't want to be to prove the right right now .
And we can reinventing how many times you get to do it .
That means that every morning , at the risveails , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I 'm going to do the family and matrimonum , a time the common perspective , almost for anyone , was that was that you can see the most possible , and he was going to do the most possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not not when , and not even what to do after .
And it 's really to play .
I teach very intelligent students , and I do think of them , and 20 percent in less work than a time .
And not because they 're less , because they 're less diligent .
but why are they impensierites , I should say , " Would I wish , I should do it now ?
" I should say , I have to think of the later ? I have to think about the feeling ? "
I 'm interrogative interrogative .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this is not completely to do this implessing and you don 't get a beautiful vote to my examples of my exament .
And they have to do it . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : We 're lucky , like Carl underneath , because the technology allows us to work every day , every day , every day , from the Hotel Randolyl Randolph .
And in parently , there 's a cornership , and I 'm not going to tell you , where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work ? It 's that we have to be continuously , in every moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son , and we can see our son in a huge , the Blackberry , the other , and the noteteam , and the noteteteam , and the nake .
And even though they are all spent , every minute that we see our child , we 're also asking the game , we 're also asking , " I have to answer to this call ? "
" I have to say to this email ? I have to habbozing this letter ? "
And also when the answer is " no , all this makes the experience of your son 's game very different than what it was in other conditions .
So , from any part of the things , and large , things , and large materials and life , life is a issue of choices .
Once the world was this : Ovention , there were some possibility , but not all was a choice of choice .
The world today is it looks like this : The lemma is , it 's a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Shadow is .
We all have the slightly known the negative ones .
And this choice is two negative effects of people .
The first , paradoxes is that produces instead of liberation .
With a lot of options in which choose to choose , becomes very difficult to do it .
I 'm going to give you an example , a study conducted on the flight plans .
A colleages had had access to the data of the Vanguard , the giant societies of funding , with about a million clients in 2,000 different different towns in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offering in more , the adesion , the flowing of two percent .
With 50 percent of offering , there 's 10 percent in less adesions than it 's just five percent of it 's just five percent . Why ?
Because with 50 source of those choose , is maledecting , is maledectively decide , and the choice is remaining to the inquestions .
And at questions , and I still asked the questions , questions , and of course , questions , and of course , I 'm not going to be .
You know , it doesn 't mean just that these workers are going to hat the dogs because they 're not going to have enough money , it also means that the decision is so ostics that they will lose the funds of the work of the dator of the work .
Not participating , they 're lost until five dollars for a year from the dator of work , which it would be really disposed to be them .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think that makes the world .
" And finish , " and ethernity , " ketchup , senaps or maionese ? "
You 'd like to take the right decision , if it 's the right decision , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong source , and yet the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second one is that we can avoid the paralysis , and do a choice , we 're less sitting from the result of how we would be able to be less options of the result of what we choose .
And that 's for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of these is that you choose , if you buy a lot of it is not perfect , and it 's not perfect , you can imagine that you can do a different choice that would be better . And what 's going on is that the alternative imagined us , and the remember the the the crawy of the choice , and the recognize the recognize it is going to be better . And the remining the remining ,
And when it was a good decision .
The choices , there are , more , it 's easier , it 's easier than any detail that 's option of the choice .
Actually , there is what economists call constood .
Dan Gilbert asked a very well , stamatit as the value we 're value that we think about what we 're going to do .
And in the rest , when there are a lot of possible options , it 's easy to represent the characteristics of the options of the options that you have options of option that options .
Here 's a example . I 've all got to all the people who are not New York .
But that 's what you probably think of it .
There 's this couple of Hamptons .
A place of the luses .
It 's splendida . Ottim days . It 's all for them .
Nothing . But what he thinks is , malth , is August . "
" Everybody my neighbors to Manhattan is . "
" I could talk about front of the house . "
And it 's going to be two weeks , from the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the chance of parking for it .
The constood for the satisfation for what we have , even when the choice was a phone .
And the more are the options that we have to look at , the more address the characteristics .
Here 's another example .
This vignize us a lot of things .
We talk about living the moment , and perhaps of living .
But the most important point is that any thing you choose to do , you can 't do other .
The things that we don 't choose to have a tactive tange that can make less attractive than what we do .
Third point : it 's a growing of expectations .
I tried it on my skin in in and buying a new jeans .
I can almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were just a type , buy them and wasn them from besty , they were dissivered , just after having them a living and work and jeans , and they 'd go well .
So , I went to buy a new when the old ones were going , and I said , " I 'm going to give a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The committed tells me , " Li wanes to fit , he relaxed me ? "
He wants to do them with the bottons or with the bottons ? "
" You want to want to strapped ? "
" Sotto them wants to the ball of the ball of the ball of the ball of the ball .
I was sitting , and after a little bit after a little bit of said , " I want the type of the kind of , " I want to do the type of jeans , and then I tried all the jeans , and then I went out from the negoties , and with the best jeans , and with the best jeans that I ever had .
It was the massive . And that was all the choice I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worked about the worst of the worst of the waites were very high , jeans had to be perfect .
And I was going to be a minime . I waiting anything about it . I waiting anything like , when I saw a kind of a kind of , unless kind of , and at least a kind of have to be perfect .
What I was buy was good , but not perfect .
After I had paragoned that I was trying to do that I was insoddissatisfied in front of the expectations .
The addition of the options in life of people don 't make the expectations that these have respond to the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the people in life .
And that will make less sflices , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing in the marketing .
Because if you know , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking .
The truth of the truth of this .
" You 'd better when he was worse or the worst " The reason that he was better when he was worse was that when he was worse was that when he was worse was even even meet .
And in the world that we live in -- opulent , industrialized industrialized citizens with the expection of perpitation -- the we can hope is that the things are at the altitude .
You never have surprised to be surprised because your expectations , the mies are ingiant .
The secret of the happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse waitative , " Yes , you want to . "
I mean , small autobiographical moment -- which is really mofe .
I could not do better , I can 't do better , I don 't have to do .
But you can 't always be a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of the jeans , when there 's only that kind of jeans is that when you 're not satisfacts , and I asked you , and I ask you , " Why ? "
" Who 's responsible ? " The answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a hundreds of jeans , and you ask you who is the responsible , it 's the responsible , is the responsible to you .
You might have done better .
With hundreds of available varieties , there are no fall-like varieties .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is , even if the result is walked , and they give the cols of them .
In the last years the depression of the depression of the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- not the only one , but important -- this honto the depression of the depression of the depression of the depression of the depression of it .
And when they have to explain this situation think that colcols are .
So the final result is that we 're better better , but we feel worse , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than having not at it , but it 's not a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magical value . I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm sure we 've been superfored by a piece of the level where the choice is improve our lives .
Now , from political point of view -- I 'm just finished -- from political view of political , the name of the political point .
What allows you all this choice in industrial society is material .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you know , where the problem isn 't that have too much choice .
The problem is that they 're too little .
So the face of the modern of the modern modern exclusive , reminds that society Western society .
And what does the arrare and arrare this : Steve Levitt talked about how those those constood and discover discover discover and discover discover . It 's a sphere . It 's a sphere of money .
I mean these choices , complicated and dispenvironment , it 's not just inuuseful .
I 'm adaptopus .
They get worse in the worst .
If a little bit of what in our societies allows is reversed in those where people have too much more to be able to improve , it would not just be to improve , but also our own life .
This is what economists call a paretian improvement .
A redistribution of the redded is good at all -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice in exception that it turns us .
And in conclude , " Fail , you can get everything that you want to do ,
You know , people of culture , you think , " What does that fish ? "
It 's obvious that you can 't get anything in a glass . "
" A castrated imagination , a limitate view of the world -- "
and that 's what I 'm interpreted with this , at the beginning .
But then , I realize , instead , I realized that the long-grid .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you eat the bocks , so that , " all you can 't get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the bock in a way that all divent can decrease .
You can see the paralysis , and you can reduce the well-being .
They all need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too much , maybe even for the fish , and even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some symolic symbolic sphere is a recipe for infecity and , for the roin .
Thank you very much .
