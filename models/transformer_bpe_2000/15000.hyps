The year I showed these slide demonstrate that the glacial calculate , which is for almost three million years of the United States , which is retrovered the United States continental , it 's retroverse , it 's retroverse 40 percent .
But this subject is the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the spector of the ice .
The glacial calculus is , in a sense , the heart of global climate system .
It 's winn and it 's going to be sumer .
The next slide is going to be a rapid on the last 25 years old .
The ice lololost of drive in red .
And you can see , you get up to the blue blue .
That 's the ice in inverny , which is the extate , which is the extate .
You can see that the ice cosign cool lose , of five years or more , it 's like the slooks like the slooks like the site here .
In 25 years , it 's been going to this .
This is a problem because the scale is the entire scale of the ice , the artical ocean artical where there are huge amount of coal coal congeled that , they 're going to transform in the microbes .
I 'm going to spect to the totality of the global atmosphering , that amount of global warming , that amount of the world 's totalks about this .
In some laghi , in Alaska , the metane is already rebulating on the water .
The professoresse Katey Walter of the Alaska of Alaska , I recently got a team pressed lesson .
Wow : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow ! The question is if we 're going to be it .
A reason is that this termatic exament scale is that this termatic exhibition .
This is a figure out of the glacial fic .
The brought never had to reached slide .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the sud-oven of Groenland .
If you want to know how the level of the sal mate of the ice of the ice , here is where I reaching the site , here is where I reaching the mate .
These corrate are running .
Another part of the planet : Antarttttttttttttttttttttttarm of the planet .
The month sscores scientists have been snegative , and the Antarcttarm , and the Antarctarctartttarcttared , which is particularly rapid in the slow sunlight .
It 's a six meters of the acive , like Greenland .
On Himalaya , the third bigger block , you see new laghes , which years ago , who were in a few years ago , who were in the high .
The 40 percent of the world population will be population of the population is going to be able to the spopulation .
Sulle Ande : this ice is the source of the population of this city .
The brought is increase .
But when it dimines , the same happens to the water .
In California , the newspaper in the Nevada is diminuge of 40 percent .
The background are in crisis .
The predictions , as you 've read , they 're free .
The growth sesesecurity in the world 's car to a night of the incends .
The disasters environmental disaster , and without precedental and without precedental .
And so , so much more number of years , I 've been respond 75 .
This is a ripping of all sustainable .
If you look at it in the context of the consequences .
In the last five years we add 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours , 25 million tons of tons in the ocean every day .
Look at attention the Pacific area , from the American American American east , and on both the west of the sub-continent , where there 's a souter imor oxygen in the ocean .
Most of global warming , together at the deforestation , which is the 20 percent of the world 's 20 percent , it 's the use of the world 's 20 percent of the combustic fuel .
The oil is a problem , and carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with China .
And he was proposed to build many other other coal .
But we 're trying to a change of direction .
These are the annative projects in the last years and some of alternative alternative .
And so , there 's a politics in our country .
The carbon industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the carbon , which is a bunch of coal .
I remember this image I was something --
I 'm going to go Natale , in the Tennessee , where I have been a loss of 3.8 billion liters of carbon dioxial scories .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second larger than scories in America .
It 's success around Natale .
The nature of one of the carbon industry was this .
I 'm going to say , ♫ ♫ Frosty coal is a kind of allegror and happy .
It 's abondant here in America , and it 's going to grow our economy .
Frosty coal is more and more more .
It 's good , adorable , and the labor and the managing workers .
Al Gore : Al Gore : That 's a lot of the West Virginia .
The larger society is Masseed . This is Masseed Coal . This is his friends .
Don Blankenship : I 'm going to be a -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid -- don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima has launched two campaiged campaiged two figure out .
This is one of them , a part .
Video : Actor : Atcher : ALergy see the climate change like a serious minaction of our business .
So , our priority is to invest a big amount of money in a such advertising to make public truth and confect the truth of carbon .
It 's actually not owner is not sport .
We think it 's a good -- it 's also a good profum .
So not preocupath of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Ack : Carbon , you have heard very much .
So , you 're going to make a glay in a landscape , as it 's about coal .
I 'm a little bit . The machines are a little noise , but this is the sound of carbon technology .
The carbon is between the main coal cause of global warming , but the the the world 's technology of carbon technology , but the carbon the carbon true of carbon .
You 're a look : this is the odie of coal technology .
Al Gore : In the alternative positive connected connected to the economic economic issue and the national security .
Video : The America is in America is in crisis ; the economy , the national security , the national crisis .
The file that the lines all of our dependence on the fuel fuel , as the carbon oil and the important coal oil and the important and oil .
Now , there 's a new , car , car solution for using it .
Repower America : 100 percent of clean energy in 10 years .
A plan to put the global work , make sure , and make sure it more sure , and help to stop the global warming .
And , a solution that bastes to solve our problems .
Repower . Scow more .
Al Gore : That 's the last .
Video : It 's about : It 's about going to be able to America .
One of the faster ways of us to get the dependence from the combustible combustible that we have our planet .
What 's the future is here . I feel here . I feel , only one of the energy , a new energy .
What you 're going to do with two : Nuoves for a few people of work .
ComI : Repower America . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old proverbio says , " If you want to go to the sun , you go from solving on the solements .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We need to go away away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
The year I 'm going to TED at TED fectransply-up ,
And I promise to get back to how the machine .
So , I have this . And for the other time , there were no , the LHHC is the largest experiment ever ever ever ever tented -- 27 miles of circummmmmit .
His task is to recognize the conditions that were less than a million a million of a second of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
All of this is just environment .
This is the Ginevra .
We 're pictures these mini-Big Bang Bang inside .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAATLAS -- it 's a 44 meters .
This is an image of ATLATLAS in built , you can see the proportions .
To tember last year we have accesum year , we have accesum for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It 's uncer immense festegg in the check of control .
It 's an image of the first phasm particles who had all over the LHC , both in collision , by a part of the LHC , and I spread particles in the LHC , and I spread particles in the level .
In other words , when we see that the 10 september , we had to understand that the machine worked , which is a big vittory .
I don 't know if it was this to exultate us more opening this , when somebody went on Google and saw that the beginning page .
That means we have a cultural impact beyond that scientific .
It was a week later , there was a problem with the car , had to these files here -- these dorded damed here -- these dorated flows here .
These files least 13,000 amps when the car machine works at the massive of power .
Now , the technicians are going to be going to say , " It 's not true . They 're too sound . "
And instead can do it because when they 're very cold slopes .
So , at less 271 degree , at a temperature in the space between the stars , these files can bring that corrate .
In one of the guntures of the most novemicle magnetes in the LHC , there was a fecuge of fectication .
So the files surrounded , and the 13,000 printing sonce met , and 13,000 printing resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think these magnetes are more than 20 tons , and that you have been spoke of 20 tons , and that there are spoke of about 30 centimeters .
They 're damage about 50 magnetes .
We had to take them , what we did .
We have repristined and encourages .
Now , they 're returning all of their place .
I mean , the end of the late of the LHC will be .
We 're going to accening , and we expect to get the right right or light , and we continue to find out what the morrow for the day , and we 're going to find out what the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain quickly , these accidents reaching the dibate value of science and engineering in frontier . It 's easy to be able to confly .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , I think it 's the limitations , I think this is the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a scientist Inglese , Humphrey Davy Davy , which , I 'm in the inuseful inutiles of the inuseful experiments of his pupleasure , " Nichael Faraday , " Nichael Faraday , said , " Nichael , who are not very dangerous for the ideas of science , which is not all our sorts of sad , which is not in our soul , and that the sunlight . "
Thank you .
I want to start ask you to start thinking about when you 're , you 're going to play with the morning .
And I 'm going to figure out how to reach them and they 're going to take them and moving them and learn them , learn in fact , and you know , really , and they 're going to be able to think of and saying with the relationships .
The reasoning is properly connected to the way we understand the world around us .
So , when we 're inspired by the using our own physical objects , together at my conon Patts , and my collaborator , and my collaborator , I started asking , I started asking , I started asking the one , instead of the digital policy , instead of the policy , could just have the cursent of the digital policy , could just have a digital site , to the soulder ,
and we put it up to our focus ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a computer interactive , like a while .
In a few words , a Siftable is a computer interactive , like a while .
You can move with the hand , they can see the same time , you can see the right movement and have a radio and a radio radio radio and a radio radio .
But it 's basically , I 'm physical objects , as the morrow , you can move out .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem to manipulate the digital information .
And as they 're more physical , conscious , conscious , of the other , and as they become more physical , conscious of the movement , of how we move , we can expense new the suncle and different kinds of interaction .
I 'm going to do with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurned to show if you in a direction , the video rothers like this , if you 're going to including on the other side back .
These record interactive interactive , the other people .
If you 're interested in what they 're interested in what they 're going to do .
If they 're circummmmit , and they can get a little bit .
If they 're circummmmit , and they can get a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We have connected that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power of the data , to put the data , " a color like a color like it is a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurned as seck of the seck of the color in the color in the color in the color in the color in the city , where they put them .
I can use them to use them to the color in that central color , where they put it .
If we 're too much , we can put a little bit of place .
It 's also beautiful possibility to apprices , like languages , the mathematics and logical logical and games where people can try and see the results of the results , and you see the results of the immediately .
I 'm now --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a equations of equations .
Here we have a toy of words that 's half between Scarabeo and Boggle .
As every turn , at all the time , you remember a letter on every Siftable , at every Siftable , at every Siftable , and while you 're trying to buy on a diputting on a diputting of a diputting on a diputting .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you can get a new set of lectiny and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came in the Media Lab , I did them in a way that I was trying and I did a video .
They were very much .
And one of the interesting things about this application is that you don 't have to give the many education .
And I just say , " What about the words , " and they 're going to do .
That 's how other people who try it .
That 's our younger head , there on the right there .
It actually wanted to imple them .
They were only morning , for him .
Now , this is an application of a interactive application .
We wanted to build a tool for the apprices of the Lui is Felix .
It can inserve new characters in the scene , solid Siftable their associated .
It can inserve new characters in the scene , solid Siftable their associated .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is source .
David Merrill : Now he brought a track in the scene .
Video : The arange arange .
I 'm doing it ! Yeah !
So school , I was Siftable and put up close to the character can interact with the characters --
Bau !
and by inventing the story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It 's a story with final final story , and it can decide how you slide .
DM : It 's a story with final final story , and it can decide how you slide .
Video : Video : I 'm going to do it .
DM : The last example I have the last example of the time of the time to show you a tool , to walk and execececuge musical .
It 's a tool , recently , to figure out and exef music .
The Siftable here is from suund like the sound , basically , and the bacteria .
Each one of these four different variations , and you can choose to be like that .
You can be inside the suncle to be able to be able to be able to your pile-like squence .
And it 's just going to make a sound and a sequence . "
These are actually that you can control from the vive , as the reverbs and the filter .
The attacks to a sound , and then including to the ency .
And then there are the general effects like time and fly , which is applicate to the sequence .
We look at how it works .
DM : DM : We 're going to put a base in two Siftable , " we 're going to the other systems , we 're going to put it in a series , we put the other base .
Now , I put a basis of based .
Video : Now I 'm going to add of percussions --
DM : And I 'm going to do the battery , so I can control the effect of the view .
DM : DM : I can run the whole sequence of the entire inclinking the time from one side or the other .
DM : And I 'm going to get the filter at the basis to give the basis to expression .
DM : I can fight the sequence of the slience " at the volo . "
So I don 't have to plan before , but I can improvise it , it 's longer or more cord .
And now , finally , I can fall the whole sequence inclinking the site on the left Siftable . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is build new interface , and more soon the way the work work and more soon like our brain and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this lost , and some possibility we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to move is that 's coming up with the new generation of designed to interact with digital media digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk with all of you .
I 'm a writing .
I 'm going to clean books , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also the love and the fashion my life .
And I don 't expect that I can change .
But , I said , something particular happened in my life and my career , which was taking me to recognize the whole recognize the whole recognize with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called " Manogy , Prega , Ama , " which , diversity from my previous books , for some reason , I 'm going to use in the world and become a big , sensational , balong .
And the result is that everywhere now , people treat me as if I were convicted .
It 's true -- condamage , condamage !
They 're going to go from me now , and they say , " Don 't you get to do better ?
You don 't have to keep to write for all life without powerful to create a book that can be able to create a book that can important ? "
that can important anybody ? "
It 's rassure , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember than 20 years ago , when I started to say , I was a adolescent -- I was a adolescent -- I was a writing written .
I was going to go to the same reaction with the same late .
And people said , " Don 't the temes of successful ?
Don 't you know that the humiliation of killed ?
Don 't you have to do this mestive for all life without the nothing to be ever out and die on a cumule of dreams of the soams of hundred of fallic floor of fallic fetime ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yeah , I have all those things .
I 've always had a paper .
And I also have a lot of other things that people could not have to be able to be .
As the algame and other things .
But , how I 'm going to write what I thought and I was asking myself , right ?
It 's rational ?
It 's logical that anybody wait to be spent by a work that I 've been sent to do .
But what 's so particular in the impress creative impress us to our health care about health care in a way that other carry don 't do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember in a time in the 40 years of activity in which was asked if she was pair to be engineer ?
Do it was never -- that blob of the engineer of engineer , how did it ?
Don 't work that , capital ?
Onestly , engineers like chemicals , they don 't certainly , in the secoli , the reputation of the reputation of being high hands .
We have enough writers , we have enough this reputation , and not just the creative , but creative reputation of all kinds of being huge instaable to be huge instaable .
And it 's not another one that look at the sad of the magnificence of the magnificence creative , only in the ventesimum century , they died young and often and often .
And the ones that they don 't have suicipate data , they 're really disdisdisdisappears .
Norman Mailer , before I died in the last interview said , " Every , my book I kill my book killed a little bit more . " A extraordinary straight a little bit of the work of their life .
But we don 't bad bad at the time we heard these things , so we 've heard these things that in some way we 've completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and the suffering , in some way , and the art , at the end , it will always be in the angoes .
And the question I want to take all of this idea today is : you 're accord with this idea ?
It 's good at this thing -- because he also looks at a centimer of a distance of this supposed to me not good for anything this supposition .
I think it 's odioxide .
And I think it 's even dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated century .
I think it 's better to encourage our big creative minds .
And I know that , in my case , in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start fire out to the couple of supposition , especially , especially , the circumstances in which I 'm in my career .
It 's really -- insom looking at , I 'm young , I 'm young , I 've been about 40 years .
I still have about four decades work in me .
And it 's very likely to be that whatever I write in the world as the world as the work that was doing after my my last book .
I 'm going to slavery , because we 're all more or friends here -- it 's likely to my home .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the genius of thinking that leading a person to start to start gin the noine , and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep continue to keep this work that we 're going to do this work .
So , the question is , how to be , how ?
And so I looked , after many reflections , which the way to work to keep out of the way to write is to create a psychological costruct , OK ?
I have to find a safety safety between me , which I 'm write , and my natural , and my natural anxide which is about what I was going to get to get them on the time , I was trying to look through the time , trying to see whether they could have the best ideas to see if they could have the best ideas and have to have the best ideas and even more sane and even even even even even even even .
about how people creative people creative to make the inherent inerent emotional for creativity .
And that research was taken to the ancient Great Rome .
I 'm going to drive because it gets back .
In the ancient Great Rome -- people didn 't seem that creativity was saying that creativity was from the men , OK ?
And it was thinking about creativity was this spirit , and that 's that they were to the men by a few source and sunknown , for reasons and sunknown .
The greenhouse called these spiriting spiriting is the demons of creativity " demons . "
Socrate , wonderful , it 's created to have a demon that beyond the sages from the landwisdom .
The Roomanist was the same idea , but they call that spirit a genius .
The Romanaged , because the Romans didn 't really think a genius was somebody particularly smart .
They have to be a genius was this kind of entity that created had living in the midle of a study article of a study , a little bit like the elfy Dobby , and that 's going to be able to be able to to high the work of the article of that work .
It 's an equal -- that 's the distance of which I talk about -- that costruck psychological that you protegen from your work .
And everybody knew that was so it worked , right ?
So the articles were protected by certain things , how to be too narcise , not ?
If your work was exciting , you couldn 't take it all the way , all of the way , everybody had been held that you were helped by this genius .
If your fallide work , it wasn 't all your ball of your hand right ?
And everybody knew that was your genius to be a hundred .
And so the people han concept creativity in the Occident for a long time .
And then the Rinascient came and all changed , and nacive this big idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe , and the middle and the misters and more more leaving space to the creatures that they write from divinity .
This was the major major rational and people started thinking about creativity , and the people started thinking about creativity .
And for the first time in the history , you start this or that article , like a rather than a genius like a rather than one person in the genius .
And I have to say , I think it was a big herror .
I think I lose someone , a simple person to believe as a recipient recipient as a source , the essence and the source of all the divines , inosconcil , inosconcil , inosconcert is a too big responsibility to humans .
It 's how to ask somebody to ingoodd the sun .
And he shape and it completely the ego and creates all these inestable inestible .
And I think it was this pression to destroyed the artict in the past 500 years .
And , if that 's true , and I think it 's the question , and now ?
Can we do it fun ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between human relationship and creative .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't sell 500 years of thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there 's people between the audience that would be able to read the scientific notion of scientific notion , insom , you do that they follow people to make their own projects .
So , I 'm not going to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I want to take it is -- why don 't ?
Why don 't think it 's not going to think about this way ?
Because it 's more sense of what I ever heard to explain the exaspering imprevebility of the process creative process .
A process that , as anybody who ever ever ever ever ever I mean , so , all here -- so , all here -- you know , you know , you know , you don 't really understand .
And in fact , it can sometimes completely paranormal .
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poetesse Ruth Stone , who 's now 90 years , but it was a poetesse for all life and said he was a poetesse for the rural infection in the Virginia , and he was working out in the field , and when a poethesis , and when a poetry was in the poetry .
He said he was like a fragorous trenor of air .
And that was rotles to her from the landscape .
The way to be coming , because he was so much to do the land under its .
He had to have a solar thing to do at that point and it was , " course , " course , " I mean , " I 'm going to be a matter . "
And so he goes to come back and he was wouldn 't have to get another one , and it would not have to get a piece of card and a bunch of card and a mathematical , as the traphic , and he gets it on the page .
And I couldn 't be fastly fastly , so that he was going to be able to come and squeen and the poetry was rotles and the poetry was rotate through the landscape , and he would keep up through the landscape , trying to say , " another one . "
And then there were those times -- this piece of the way I 'm going to be -- there were the moments where the was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running up to the city and a poetry and poetry , and he was a hard of the way , and then he was going to a hand , he said , that was how if he was saying , he was like you slow with the other hand and the floating .
He was the poetched by and he was put it in his body and turned into his body and turn the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be in the perfect page , but at the last word at the last word at the first word .
So when I thought -- it 's a crazy , it 's exactly equal to my process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a moving , and my way to work is , and I know , you know , at the same time and I 'm going to work and go and step and I 'm going to work and go out and step .
But I even in my head , I have a bad , I have a shared against that thing , sometimes .
And I 'm image that also a lot of you the han done .
You know , even if the work and ideas were saying , I 'm from a certain source you can 't know .
And what is this thing is this thing ?
And how can we make it out to be able to be able to lose the head , but , rather , rather , that do you do it ?
And I 'm about , the best example of the contemporary contemporary , which I have the Waits , which I 've interviewed in the day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of the life was the incarnation of the article of the articulated articate , trying to try and figure , to make these species of impulse inate impulse creative totally interorization .
But then I invited , he 's calculate , and one day as he was driving on a car car Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going to fast and all of a sent tract this little framment of melodia , which is going to be in his head as it does , the inspiration and slow , and the wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and it 's not like to take it .
It 's not a piece of card , it doesn 't have a car registrator .
So he started to hear this kind of old ancient ances in him like , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to lose from this song .
I 'm not enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go in the panic , it 's stop .
I 'm going to put the whole process of mental process , and he made something completely new .
I 'm going to look at the top and said , " Scyke , don 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" Do you know , you know , a song now ?
If you really want to existing , back in a moment , when I can get care of you .
Otherwise , you 're going to be able to do something else today .
I 'm going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process , he was working changed after this .
I don 't work , the work was still dark as a always .
But the process , and the fish ancient ances that was releft when the genius , the genius that was out of him , the genius that 's out of the other problems and flipped out where it was , to make it a whole thing thing that had to be a whole thing thing that had to be a whole thing and come back .
But it 's going to flow , beard , beard bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange that allow and this strange that allow along .
So how the story I was going to change a little bit of the way I was working and already to me .
This idea , I was save when I was writing " Manogy , Prua , Ama , " and cadds in one of those cave of the disperation where we 're working on something and we don 't have to start thinking that it will be a disaster , which will be the worst of the book that will ever be written .
Not just a bad , right , right , it 's worse .
And I started thinking about this project .
But then I remember about Tom I was talking about the air and I try and .
So I put my face in the handed and I resses my own hundred a vacuum of the room .
And I said , " Sent , what 's going to be , " What 's not going to be brilliant not going to be a brilliant not going to be the whole , right ?
Because how I 'm going to get all I 'm put all that I have no longer than this .
So if you want it to be better , you have to present your part of it .
OK . But if you don 't , you know what I 'm not going to do it .
I 'm going to writing the same because it 's my work .
And I want to do it for me that I was recorded to me today , " Because I was going to do my part of the last is so , OK -- in the end of the North People were people raded for the lunning of the slunch of the karo , and music and sacra that were going to go on the hours and the albala .
And they were always magnific , because the ballerins were professionals and were fantastic .
But every way , rarely , something happened , and one of these article was actually transendent reality .
And I know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've seen it , at a point , a lose way .
It was as if the time you stop , and the ballery , and the ballery through a kind of bral , and he didn 't do anything like 1,000 night , but all of it was sitting .
And at the suddenly supply , as a human human .
But it 's going to accinside and under the illuminate in the fire of divinity .
And when this is happening , you know , the people who were what was called the cool .
They were trying to slow the hands and began to slow , " Allah , Allah , God , God , God , " God . "
That 's God , you know .
And I mean , the Morers invaded -- when the Morers invading the south of Spain , presered this abitudines with them and the surface of " Allah , Allah , " Ols , Allah , " which you can hear in the corride of the corride .
In Spainting , when a article in Spainting , " Allah , the words , I 'm , I was a , I was walked , " I was a God of God .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem is the next day , for the ballery , when you wake up and find that they 're the 11 of Martedyes and find that 's 11 of Martedyes , and I won 't there .
It 's just a mortal with mortal gran to the ginoccurred , and maybe not going to get to that ality .
And maybe anybody will slow the name of God still as it was , and what 's what you have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most pain to make a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angotiate if you can 't believe , inside , the most extraordinary expects of your own being being being from from you same .
But you just think they 're going to you to get data from a unimaginable squisity of this squisity part of your life that you 've got to get to another when you 're going to somebody else .
And , you know , if we think that 's about this way .
And so I started thinking , and it 's sure , and it 's sure how I thought for different months during the book that I was working on the book , I 'm going to be able to the time , the spent , I 'm going to exhibition , I 'm going to do it .
And what I 'm going to keep when I feel when I feel electric by this is , not going to have .
Not to take you . It 's just your work .
It 's a deal for your part , whatever , whatever can be .
If your work is to ball of your work is balance .
If the divine , I asked you to get a decide of leaving some kind of wonderful wonderful , for one moment through your sentence , then , " Olay ! "
I did the same same your dance .
And " Ole ! "
I think it 's a taught to teach it .
" Olay ! " I 'm the same , even only for the human heart , and touch tal tal handing of the tal high .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And you know , I 've already talking about some of these projects on the human genome , what 's going to meaning and discovery of genes .
Now we 're starting a new lost : We 've started digitalize biology and now now to start out from that digital code we 're both in a new phase of biology , design and we 're going to design and intetizing life .
We 've always been trying to bring big questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists I think they have tented to figure out of livels .
We tried different approaches , reduced to the third terms .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to move from the analogical world of the computer world .
Now we asked : We can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the small genome of the little little bit of those who can autoreplicate in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little more small .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred of the genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we 're a look at the metabolic maps , it 's relatively to our .
I mean , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very improbly that this can bring a living cellent living .
So we decided that the only to provide it was to synthrow this cromosom in way to make some of these fundamental questioning to get some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the avventure of " Pomosom , we can synthetize a cromosoma ? "
It can be the chemicals to produce these big molecules that we 've never able to create before ?
And in case , in case , we can make a cromosom ?
A is simply a piece of chemical chemical material .
The speed with which we 're able to digitalize life is growing up to exponential exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , prodiscussion , but it 's better better .
And our most recent recently recently reporting on a exponential curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process process has required a lot of lots , starting with a bioetic review before we started the first experiments .
But we found that that synthetize DNA is very hard .
There are thousands of cars of thousands of car the world that 's longer than 30 to 50 lective lecting 30 to 50 lective lective , the most herrors , the more herrors .
So we had to develop a new metal , to assemble these framments and correct the errors .
And this was our first tentative , to start digital information of the genome of Phi X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills kill .
We designed the framments , effected the correction of the errors and get a molecule of DNA about 5,000 lective lective .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical chemical material and we put it into the bacteria , the bacteria have started to read this genetic code and protected the viral particles .
The viral particles were back and they were back and they 're back and they come back and have distrutt and have distrutt .
I talked about recent with the oil industry and oil industry that they 've certainly compress that they 've certainly compress this .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build the same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in larger .
We wanted to build the whole cromosoma of the bacterium .
It 's more than 580 mies to code genetic code .
So we thought about building it in the cassed of the virus of the virus , so that we could change the cassed for the living cells to figure out what the living living living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequencing this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accurately standard was of a herror for every 10 mies .
We found , resequency , 30 herrors . If we had used that original sequence .
One part of the process is designing segment , long , which is to be able to be able to the square saying with all the other segments of 50 lectiny to work together .
We 're going to the only one here .
You 've got a little bit of the floor of floor .
Think of this : We have a genetic code on four lect-lecting , C , GG and Time .
Three of those lectures together codification about 20 minoacids , and there 's a specific order to lecting for every amminoes .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , framework , depending .
What we did at the beginning was autography .
Some were in the fact that it wouldn 't be poetry .
We designed these segments to just just to be able to only only one with the inner .
There are instance that repair them and put them together .
And we started to assemble parts , starting with seats from five to seven miles from five to several site , unending a segment of 24 mies to get to get up to 72 mies .
So , we 've made these sequency in a abundance , so that we 're trying to make a very such checking process of the extremely robustood -- as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this looks like the tabellon a basket .
When we 're going to these very long time , the more than 100 miles , 100 mies , they don 't grow more directly in the Ecoli .
It 's going to the modern limit of the molecular modern biology .
So we 've been looking at other mechanisms .
We had another mechanism called recombination omologa , which in biology , which is using using DNA can use the several DNA can be able to sune the segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , it can assorbing three million rad .
You can see in the such sumer as his cromosoma globe destroyed .
In 12 hours -- 24 hours is reassembled as it was before .
They have thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely seought .
They can live under the vacuum .
It 's absolutely certainly , and you know , to find new environments of water .
It showed the NASA showed that this avel .
This is an image of the molecule that we built , by using these processes , by using the lipts with the segments of the segments of the segment of the segment of the molecule that we built out .
The louder them eass .
This image was not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule that we can see it with a microscope with a microscope .
These are pictures that couple of about six seconds .
This is the public that we did a time ago .
It 's more than 580,000 lectiny code .
It 's the molecule , the larger 's ever created by the man .
It 's a molecular weight to 300 million .
If we stamp with a 10 without spaces , we would like 142 pages , we would just like 142 pages to translate this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ?
Of course , truly , a virus is a game from kids .
It 's a little more complicated when they use bacteria .
It 's also simpler when it 's eucariote as our : you can just extract the nucley nucley and inserious one , which is basically the clonation of clonation .
In the bacterium cromosoma is integrated inside of the cells , but we have recently demonstrate that we 're able to do a transplant of a cell cell to another one , and activity .
We can refied a cromosom , we 've got a microbial microbial .
The two are different as the men of the men .
We 've add some gene in a way that I could decide what I 'm going to choose for this cromosoma .
The spoke with the ency in a way to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cells was stupendent -- and we appreciate our graphic graphic graphic , the new cell cell .
And we were thinking we couldn 't go beyond , but we 've tried to spend more in there .
This is one of the most evolution of evolution .
We found that very much species have added a second or a third cromosoma , add in a second thousands of tracks in a second thousands of tracks .
So who think about evolution is a gene at the time that modies doesn 't understand part of biology .
There are a required of restription that advice digery , which is the digery of DNA .
The cromosom that was in the cells , not at one .
The cell phone that we put it out .
It 's expresse , and he recognized the other cell as a material , has the masticate , and we 're ritting with only the cells and the new cell cell .
It became blue because of the genes we put .
And in a short least time , all the carteristics of a kind of fandandscape , and it 's transformed in a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cells .
All the proteins are changed , the membrane is changed , and when we 're reading the genetic code of equivalent , and when we 've got it .
Now , this could look at the genetic , but it 's going to be able to change things in the software DNA , we can change things in the way .
Now , I 've already explained that here is not talking about genesis -- but of progress to three million years and a half million evolution , and I 've said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the Cambrian exactly where they will be created new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's enough obvious when we think about our need .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right for example , I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each planet for each in 40 years , there will be four .
We 're going to have problems now to find food , water and clean , and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more to do it for noine billion .
We put more than five billion carbon carbon carbon coal , more than 30 billion baries of the oil .
That means a million million baries a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or whatever of process to reduce them , it will be a huge huge challenge .
We have to hold out of the CO2 emission of these materials that finished in the atmosphere .
And in the day of the scientific discovered in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are the designed for the future .
The electronics industry only only only one dozen about a dozen about components , and you think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limitations here are the biological , and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these metrunning of synthetization , able to create what we call genomics combinatory .
We 're able able to build a big robot that can produce a million cromosomes at a million cromosomes at a day .
Think of processing these 20 million different genes or try and get the processes to produce either optimize , new vaccines , new vaccines , we can change , thank you , and create more biology , and create more biology .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose to be able to survive , chemicals , chemicals or carbon , production of the chemicals .
This is an instantanowners of some software programmed to be able to sat and design a kind of several to the computer .
Well , we don 't need to be as they will be .
We know exactly what the same code is their genetic code .
Now we 're concentrating on the carbon dioxial cooking .
You 've seen you that extract ethanol from the grate was a finite finite experiment .
We have more more than the second carbon and third generation that will be surround enough to coal coal cooking than the high value as the either of the butanole .
But the only way the biology can have a big impact with without increase without increase the cost of food and limitate the display of the disponed , the display of the world , which we 're working for the clusters that can get to design cells that can get out of the coal , and we 're able to have the first coal of generation in about 18 months .
The sunlight sunlight with CO2 is a metodow -- but in our discoveries all over the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism we have described in 1996 .
It 's in the ocean deep the deep ocean , about 2500 feet of ebullition of water .
They 're going to put out from the CO2 molecular hydrogen as well .
We 're trying to figure out if we can incannot be able to be transported by cutting that CO2 in carbon , to drive that CO2 in carbon , to drive this process .
So , we 're going to be able to increase what we can be able to increase what the base question of " What is life is the " is the " Do , we have the modity of the goal of the oil intererate industry .
Exactly . If you don 't do it from TED , where you can 't do it from TED , where you can 't do it from TED , where you can 't do it from TED , where you can 't do it from TED , where you can 't do it from TED , where you can 't do it from TED , where you can 't do it from TED , where can you ?
It would have a main source of energy .
And we 're working on using the same metods to create vaccines .
You 've seen this year with the influence , we 're always back to a year and with a dollar in the one one dollar when it 's going to find the right .
I think that this is going to change building sought in an ancient sunable in ancient ancient .
That 's how the future could start seem changing , now , the tree of evolution , acceling the evolution of evolution with bacteria , and you end up the eucarial eucarial eucarial eucarial .
We 're so much from the best people .
Our discovering is to do enough to be able to try and do it . Thank you very much .
I 'm going to do you see , the most rapidly possible , some fundamental work , a new technology that we 've taken to the Microsoft in the following one year ago . That 's Seadragon . That 's Seadragon .
It 's a environment in that you can interact with a huge amount of data .
We 're seeing a lot of gyte photo-photo-cost photos with a suglandscape , and I continue , to a sandandscape , disponing the images of how we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these are the picture of data or the images of data or the images .
Most of the digital photography , but this for example is a scanning scanning from the Biiiiiijeca Congress , and it 's in the leg of 300 megapixel .
It doesn 't do any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your precognize in the moment . It 's an architecture very flexial architecture very flexize .
This is a whole book book , example of data not not images .
This is the Dickens of Dickens . Every colonna represents a capital .
And I 'm going to show you that it 's just a test and not images , we can do something like this , to see that it 's a representation of a representation of the textbook , not a photo-, not a photo-, not a photo-, not a photos .
It could be a way of artificial to read a book to read a book of electronic book .
I don 't have to be advice .
This is an example of the most realistic number of the Guardian .
Every image image of a section .
And it really gives you the beautiful experience of the truth of the truth of a revision or a quotidian , which is for nature a moltle of a half a lot .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We 've created a fashion the higher , much more high than that you use in a normal published -- and we 've inserious about the content .
If you want to see the carteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limitations of space .
We 're going to be able to put up at the end , and other porcheries and other pop-up , you don 't have to be necessarily .
And of course , the mapplications is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not lose , if we don 't have to say that we have contributing to do this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. .
So now we 're going to go back to something else .
This is now actually actually from the view of the web ; you can go to the web ; you can see it .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research a very interesting research in Noah Snavority , a student of Washington , with the aid of Steve Steve Steve Steve Microsoft Rick Steve Microsoft Rick Szeliskels of Microsoft Rick Steve . " One .
And it 's from the view , the web , gestion .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from a image to the other image and have this kind of experience to have this kind of extra experience .
But the space of the space of the picture here effectively .
And the algorites of visualization computers have registrated these images together , in a way that the recorrespond to place in the recorrespond to the laghi Rock on Montagne Rock , there 's been been writing -- there were been walking . I 'm taking up . And so the soul , you see elements of the soulder , and these things are all across the space .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space space .
I want to go to one of the original data , and this is from a prototype of the original Photosynth that we 've done for the first time the scort scort of the first time the extate scores that really the scores is really the key to be able to the first downth . And it 's not necessarily recognize that we have put in the website that we have in the website .
We had to worry about legal law and so on .
This is a reconstruction of the Let 's get Dame picture of Flickr . Baast digitate Dame in Flickr , and you get images of the types , other fies of the field of the fields , other campus , and I said , you know , one of these concerned an image that is discovered to this model .
So , they 're all pictures from Flickr and they 're all linked at the time .
And it 's possible to navigate this way .
You know , I would never have ever thought about the way to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratification to recognize this kind of accooking here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different types of types of photowers , from those of the phones of the phones in SLR , a number of significant significant , put in this environment .
And if I can get it , I 'm trying to try and see those more strange .
Many are block , etc .
I 'm going to some part here is a series of photographs -- here .
This is a Notre Dame recorrectly recorrectly .
We can move from the moment to the physical vision of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking from the intermemory -- from the whole memory of how the land is the land of vision of visual visual -- and I college all those data together together .
All those pictures become linked together , most of the som of the parts .
You have a model of the land that it emerging .
Think about this as a sound of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grow in complexity , and the people use it , and the the anciages for the em of the use of the use of the use .
Their picture are shared with the other people .
If somebody 's idea of the idea of the idea of the name , my photo the name , my photo of the Notre of the Comer 's pictures of all those data , and I can use how to get the ingrest of all of those data , and I can use the photos of the way , using the photos of the cross-moke photo-mod-like cross-moke , and red cross-moke .
Of course , a consequence of all this is virtual model of all interesting elaborate , I 'm not just to be able to be able to be able to ope and satellite and satellite and similar , but from the memory of the satell-hand-to-satellite , but from the memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software going to do is that at a point , in the next few years , in the next years , all the photographs , all the picture of anybody in the world will be able to be colleaged together ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing in practice is to find .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , you know , between the images .
And it 's doing it in the basis on the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting , if you think about the recognize of the security that many of these images .
And as you do a research of images on the web , you digit on the web , and the textbook on the web of the picture of the picture .
Now , what 's going on if that picture you 've got to all the picture of your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of the amount of the site of the wealth that is really huge . It 's a classic effect of the networks .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible . It 's really incredible .
BAA : I 'm very much .
One of the main pipes when you travel and one of the deliver research is the power of living in the power of who don 't forget to live in the anti-traditions , between the wind of the square in the wind , the wind in the piogges of the plants .
And I think the sciamani Jaguar travel travel of the Lattea , or that the mites of the Inuit are still college of the Inuit , or Himalayas , the good insea of Dharma , to remember the important thing of the central Dharma , to remember the important important way , but it 's a sense that the world that we 're not going to be able to living , but it 's just a model of the world ,
the consequence of a particular screatch that our strules that our strules has done , or a lot of generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
We all all of them . We all do it .
We 're subjects to be initiation .
We need to deal the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprising and whalked and we 're going to --
We all have an art .
What it 's the particular rhythm , the rhythm of the dance of every culture .
Not care that they are the inforests of the Borneo , or the following of Haiti , or the Haiti , or the Haiti , or the wert Kaisut in Kenya , or a Curnerry in Kenya , or a cameras in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my company in the journey of journey in the desert of the high of the car of the world 's valuable , the demother 's demother 's demother of the world .
All of these populations teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of moves in the world .
And , if you reflect a second , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
And along with , my cultures of cultures of the world creating a spiritual life and cultual that we wanted the planet and cultural well-being , as the planet as the ragela of the planet as the ragela .
And you can think about this cultural ragela cultural ethnosis , and you can define the som of the som , I was the total , inspiring , inspiration , inspiration , inspiration , intuition , intuition , inspiring , intuition ,
The ethnosfetime is the patrimonum of human .
It 's the symble symbols of what we can be in how much species .
And because the biosphere was free consumed by the way , it 's happened to the ethnos-free and purpose much more rapidly .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species was or is on the horge of the extinction , because it 's false -- in the hypocalyc , in the hypocalyc diversity -- and you don 't have to get close to the most optimise in the ipose of the world 's good at the most optimistic cultural .
The insays of all this is , of course , the loss of language .
When you 're born existed 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed to a vocabulary or a series of grammmmer .
A language is the sprap of human spirit .
It 's the middle of which animal is in the material in the material world .
Every language of the mind , a mind , a thought , a thought , a spiritual chance .
And of the 6,000 languages , as we 're sitting here in Monterey , at least half it 's not more supply sitting in the earlier of children .
They don 't have laugh , the children that means , at less you wouldn 't be something , which are already death .
What 's the longer than the silence , the last silence , to be the last to talk about a language , not how to get the sages of the sages or to ancient the ancient or ancient promises ?
This was a flowing was the state of someone in some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a moment and a door and brand with sneighboring in the ulsyllabes of a ancient language .
And I know somebody to say , " Don 't it better ?
The world would not be a better place if we talk about all the same language ? " Bensim , then we 're talking about it . We 're talking about saying , we 're going to go out .
We talk kogs .
You 're going to be a tract thing to say that you can 't talk about the language .
I like to do a journey through the ethnosneightly --
a little journey in the landscape for give you a lot of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " diverse ways of existing existing existing .
We 're going to make this bimber Barasan , in Amazony , the popular of the anacony , which crees at the anacond of the latte of the latte of the latte of the swalking of the saces of the saces of the saces of the saces .
It 's a popular popular popular color , because the blue blue is because the cell is identified in the forest , which is the popular of the popular , which is the popular of the popular ,
They have a strange language and a mathematical language , " " " " " You have to spoke a different language .
And all of this radical has in the midle of the mitologic , the particular families in which is that in these families or spoke , because of the matrimons of mought , no one of the matrimons .
They 're limited to listen and then start talking about .
We 're going to one of the most interesting tribes that I 've lived , the Waorani Waorani , a popular popular that 's the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have tented a common herror a herror .
They did the photograph I made them in a pose that they were running in a populse that this population of the pluvial foresta had never seen anything of the pluvial forest .
They 've raise the land , they have turned out to the research a form or a figure out of a and , not find anything , they have concluded that they were going to be hundred five missionaries with the lance .
But Waorani not only killed to the straniors .
They killed to kill them .
The 54 percent of the mortality was caused by them .
We 're risalites to get generations and we found two natural cases of natural morte and when we 've got to know , they have a lot of them who was invected to be able to say , and then they killed it , and then they killed the same .
The crazers were able to recognize the animal urina , and to recognize the species .
In the early ' 80s , I was assigned a very interesting task when my professor of Harvard asked me if I wanted to go to Harvard in the secret of the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes and Tonton Macoutes , and I can imming on the zoom , and I can do the zoom , and impossessor .
So to give a sense to my sense of miracology , I should have to understand the Vodoun 't magnership .
It 's pretty much of a complex metaphysical view of the world .
A lot of interesting .
If I asked you to ask me about the big religions of the world , what would I say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the Africa is sub-Saharan Africa 's not religious religious . And instead of it is not else that the distilled of these religious concepts , very deep , very deep deep in the tragic tragic lator of the tragic ,
What makes the voodow is the intense is the intense between life and death .
So , the visual people make the spirits .
The spirits can be invocated by Great the Great the remarkable , respect to the dance and they 're going to replace to the soul of the vive vive vive , in a very brief of the way that a bad became .
So , that 's voodow up to say , " You know , " You know , white the white of God .
We 're going to say in the temple and divention God . "
And from the moment that you 're going to be the spirit that you 're driving you , how can you do the mal ?
So you 're going to these incredible events : follow the following voodow in the state of trance that touch a demonstration rather strong demonstration of the power of the mind in the body of the mind , in a state of extreme , excitation .
And the populations with the most extraordinary popular the most extraordinary are the Kogi of Sierra Nevada , in the Colombirth , in Colombirth .
It 's an ancient ancient civilization that once had living on the planure of Colombia in the conquister of the conquister , the population was on the makes of the mainly vulcanic , which ertaining on the planture .
In a macchiated continent , this popular , this popular never been conquned by the spages .
And now , now , it 's government from a clero-supply , but they 're very extraordinary .
The young following gets away from the families to three or four years , and they live secreated in a world of good and sitting in a world of the base of the base of the base of the ice for 18 years .
Two high years of proposed to reduce the nine months of gestation that spring in the user of the mother of the mother , now are metaphor , now they 're metaphor in the Great Mther .
So , this time , they get accultural values of their society , values that they 're going to previous and just their preciate to equilibrium , or to say the equilibrium , or to say the equilibrium .
And in the terminal of this incredible beginning , they 're improviously taken out and the first time in the age of 18 years , they see an alba . And in that across that accounters of the first wrong , when the soles of beautiful , when the soles of beautiful , everything that have learned in the teorted , all that learned in the splender is conferred to the furnered . The prete prete ,
" As I 'm going to do you .
It 's stupend . I 'm protegging it . "
They call most of them , and they say that we , fratels , we 're the college path , we 're the college of destruction of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the ingene and the environment we 're invoice and the old old old story of the noble bull , which is a concept in his simplicity or perhaps in the simplicity or perhaps , we 're going to the neighbors of the Earth .
The Ingenes are not sental sental sequal .
There 's no space for these things in the paluge of the Astat or the gelids of the Tibet , but because of the time and I think , they have created a mystics of the Earth 's not on the concept of the Earth is not to be able to be able to be able to live in the neighborhood , but in an intuition , the concept that the Earth 's consciousness of human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
He says a guy that a guy of Ande who grow grows that the mountain is a spirit Apu that 's a Apu that 's a human destiny , it will be a human destiny , and it will have a very different report of the Mountain of the mountain or that a boy of Mountain 's squeen , that a mountain of Montana .
That 's the dimage or a high or a mineral , it 's irrifer .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that is the metaphor , the natural world .
I grew up in the forest of the Britannic Columbia creating that the forests services were wrong .
What I made a human human being in the world , Kwakiutl that crede forestestimes are the Hukukuk of Hukuk and the storm of Hukukuk and the stort of the world , the spiriters that live in the world , spiriters that live in the world , spiriting that they 're going to hate the Hamats .
If you start looking at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start understanding some of their discovered discovered . We make this plant .
I took this picture to open in the Nororororcity .
Mayahuash , the most powerful such , the most powerful sustained the most powerful such of the sciamanic repertoium .
What makes the layahuash is not the potential to make macological potential of the sustainance , but the elements . It 's composed to two elements .
It 's a landlate , this label , this label , a series of cocarboline , harmine and harmolin , slightly slightly halluciny .
I just take the solar plant is a blue that 's blue that 's a little bit the consciousness , but it 's miscreen with the leaves of a family said , but it 's mix-blue family said .
This plant contains sad sad , very similar to the serotonin , dimethoxyptamine-five , methoxyptamines .
If you 're going to see Yanomami , you 'll see Yanomami , which do you have a different set of species , anched methoxyptches .
It 's a little bit like to be a little bit like to be sparate as a sparate spared by a fire source of dipink and bacterwards on a mate electricity .
I had oftes with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who waten the psychedelics , with his discovery of the function of the fungy in the ' 30 in Mexico .
I 'm not going to be a tiny , you can 't classified these tripes like , because if you 're not telling anybody to tell you anybody to be slow . [ Rear ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] Look .
It 's possible to sumer the horally if you 're going to get with other such such a lot of other such such .
Now , this is the beautiful : the painting , which are in this liana is the MAO , the same kind of MAO , the same kind of need to be able to be able to be able to be able to the sad . The ow-up sad in a 80,000 species of plants , how these popular popular ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ar ?
We use the great euge eusual eusual ef , which can revehicle .
But if we ask the Indians , they will tell us , " The plants are talking about . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuash , which is nectely in the forest , and that you 're going to our eyes in the same species .
If we ask them how they 're going to be able to say , " I thought I would say , " I thought of plants , " I don 't know all of the rest ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take 17 variety in a night of lay and each night with a different .
And I don 't have a Harvard to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting than to be .
Now , [ [ ] ] the problem is that those of us who have heart popular populers find them in the ingenes are pitting , but in some way you have pitting you to the world 's history of the story of our real world , and it 's almost .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it will not reminded for the truly or its innovations , but rather like the way we stop and we have stop acking and we have burn across the deal of biological diversity and cultural diversity of biological diversity and cultural diversity and cultural diversity . Now , the problem is not the change .
All cultures through the secoli have been involved in a very squeen for new possibility .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians have not stop to be Sioux when they put out of Sioux when they put out of the Americans don 't stop to be Americans when they 're not stop being being Americans when they 're put from the horse and .
It 's not the change or technology that integrity of the ethnosis . It 's the power .
The face of the domination .
And if you 're looking at the world , you 'll find that these are not cultures that these are not cultures to be square in .
They 're creatures and dynamics out of the existence from the existence of identify , they 're going to adaptation .
And it 's disbowitness in the patria of the Penan inner of the Penan --
a popular no-called Sarak , in the sudest , a popular who lived in the south of the suddeitude , and now it 's going to the service and prostitution on the service , where the prostitution of the rive of the field , where you can see the lifeting of the liftouch , where the way the Mererday , where the horest Merererday , where the hororororse , where the horizononyourself ,
To you get the stage with the square dream of the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that are the disease of the golden of the golden .
If we 're on the mountains of the Tibet , where I 'm doing many research , you 'll see the duror the political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physical extinction of a popular , it 's conviction , but the ethnocide , the destruction of a popular popular , not just a cell of a popular , but it 's not not condition , but it 's a cell of the strategy , because it 's part of the strategetable , because it 's part of the strategy of the strategetable , because it 's part of the strategy ,
And you can 't understand the suffering of the Tibet until you 're not part of the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles miles from China in the Cina in the Cina , in the Tibet sudoriental , from Lhasa with a young , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what the statistics is behind the statistics of the statistics , but only only one came to .
6,000 monuments sacred in the poll and car .
1.2 million people killed by military military military hard .
The father of this guy was ascritical to Panchen Lama .
The which means that it was killed to the Chinese invasion .
I was smoke with Sanity Sanity during the diaspite that he took the popular that 's taken the popular that 's taken the way .
And he was taken and his college was being rich and it was to be rich .
It was taken to a career at the age of two years old nasure of two years old nose , because it would not live in the least because it would not live in the site of him .
The sister , which did the same , it was put in reeducation .
One day has invercalculated a fashion Mao and , for this transgression , was meside , was meside , was mesight to the works for seven years .
The pain of the Tibet can be unsuch , but the spirit of the popular of the popular is hard .
And then , it 's all the time , it 's a choice .
We want to live in the world world 's world 's monothy , or we want to get the world policowners ?
The great anthropologists , before he said that his bigger said that his bigger was that , in our towards this way , we will see the whole gamma of the world , we don 't just see the whole gamma of human imagination , but one day we 'll be able to sleep to a modality of thinking , but one day we 're going to sleep from a sondon 't forget to the other possibility .
And it 's umiliating our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The Neolitical Right , which given us the agriculture , which has done us to the secity of the seed cult of the seed crazy of the saman with the project of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industrialized has been 300 years old .
That 's whatever I 'm not going to me to get the answers that we have to all the challenge to be able to go .
When these myriades of cultures of the world is asked what we want to say to be , respond with 100,000 different voes .
And it 's in these answers that we all risk to be what we 're going to be what we 're : a kind of conscious , which has to make all the people and the gardens of the sought . And there are great moments of the way . And there are great moments of it .
I took this picture on the northern extremely , when I went to the Baffin , when I went to clean with Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , I told the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The government sadn 't always been gentle with the Inuit and the 50 to stage our supply to stay our supply , we have rinkilled them in colonies .
The grandander of this man refected to go .
The family , I 'm telling for his life , and the brought up all of the arms , and all of his atticks .
You have to know that Inuit don 't have the cold ,
The paces of the slitms in origin were made of fish .
The grandander of this man doesn 't intimise from the artics or the library , or the library .
It 's gattacked out , it 's calculate the pantalone and defected in their hands . When the phoes are congeled , it 's working on it , he worked the ball works , he works creating a lama .
He 's spring on the rockaccept of this color , and when I save , he killed a sand when I sent a site .
He was scacross the dog and created a bridaughter , with the cash , he created a slextta , he was sleep , he was sleep on the banker , college of the ballows in the reast .
We want to talk about cavarsely ? [ Rate ] And this , in different ways , [ Applausi is the symble symble symbbox of the Inuit and all the people in the world .
In the way , 1999 , the government Enuit , in the total control of a territority of the larger area of the larger California and Texas I was together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's a independent terrible . Controlly all the resources .
One splends of how a national state could recognize with his popular popular .
And , to finish , I think it 's rather obvious at least who 's been in these zone remote crazon the planet , make it configure out that they 're not in remote .
For somebody is .
They represent sections of the human imagination . And for us all of the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , like dreams of these children , becomes part of our children , becomes part of the hopeful geography .
For finally , we have National Geographic , we convince that politicians will never get anything .
We believe that the polemies --
[ Applasive ] ] ] are not persuasive , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the world 's stories to tell us the world . Olay of our site .
156 countries turing our television .
Our revilies from millions of people .
Our work is travel in the ethnossmoke to bring our audience in the beyond cultural , which is going to be able to wrong as they saw and , you hope , they 're hoping to be able to the central revehicle of the world 's world 's existing in the world 's world 's sity , and we have to find one style a world of life in a world , and multicultural world .
where the sagges of all the popular popular can contributing our ball .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I 'm going to say , you know , and I 'm going to evidence some of leges , in the case not the notaken .
I want to start with what I call the sufficial dogma . "
The official dogen than what ?
The official dogen 's cousual dogen , the dogen such dogen , " If we want to massive to the benefit of our citizens . " The way to do it is to do it , it 's a maximage of the individual docity . "
The reason is , from a moon , in the fact that freedom is in the same value , it 's precious , use , it 's precious , useful for human beings .
And in the other is in the fact that if we are libes , each of us can be able to do all that maximices our benefit , without any any than our well-being , no one that decide in our name .
The way to massive freedom is maximage the choice .
More choice , the people have , the most of the liberation , and most of the freedom is their own .
This is so reenge , it 's so remainly radicate in society that nobody would be able to put it in the doubt .
And it 's also a foundly radicated in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has been possible .
This is my sound . It 's not particular . It 's not particular .
I 'm a simple note on the condition for the condition .
In my supermarket is 175 conditive , without content 10 variety of the extraves of holive and 12 aces and 12 acecaces that you can buy for you a huge number of the 175 , already to be your own own own own own own own ,
That 's the supermarket .
And then you go to the electronic negotie to buy a stereo , the CD , a couple , radio , the left , the left , the left , printing .
And in this single negoties , there 's a big number of components .
We can make six million and a half million different combinations using the components that there are in a only negoties .
You have to put that there 's a lot of choice .
And the world of the communications .
Once , when I was a kid , they could get all the rest of the phone , the pat the moment that were sitting from mamma moth of moving mother .
I was going to get the phone , you didn 't buy it .
One consequence of that , between the other , it was that the phone is not the phone .
These tempers are going to go .
We have a variety of phones , especially between the phones , especially between the phones .
Here 's the cellular cell phones .
My favorite is the midle , the MP3 , cut of the nass of the nass , and the shape for the one .
If you don 't have seen it in the negotie in the home , you 're going to be able to do it .
And what the end is that people in the negogoties in the negoties and this question . And you know , what the answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell that it doesn 't do it too much .
So in other aspects of life that are much more important than the people , you know , the same exhibition of choices .
Assistence , health care : it doesn 't happen in the United States that you go to the doctor and the doctor , the draw you 're going to do .
And then , I won the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do Actually , " Actually , " Are these guys and these said , " Boy and these risks " Boy , " Bokay , " Bokay , you know , "
You know , " Dr, what I should do ? "
And the doctor says , " As these bells and these risks , and B has these benefit and these answer . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you can get it , " Dr. if she was me , what would do ? "
And the doctor : But I 'm not her . "
The result of the result of the maled , " authonomy , " expression that makes it beautiful .
But actually , it 's not that a fish and responsibility to take some of the decisions of the decisions that knows the doctor , somebody else knows -- and almost of the certainly is not -- and so it 's not in the ideal condition to make decisions of the patient decisions ,
There 's a huge marketing products , direct direct people like me and you , that if you think you don 't have any sense , because you can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do you get them ?
The answer is that they want to be doctor for us to call the doctor for us to change us .
What 's the fundamental as our identity is a hort issue is a choice , as you see in this jobs , like we don 't want to force the children . " We don 't want to get a hydrop . " We don 't have a hydrop more than the hydrop . "
And we can reinventing how many times us .
The means that every morning , at the risk , you have to decide that kind of person wants to be .
I 'm going to the family and mathematrimonum , a time time , it was that you were almost for anybody , was that I was that there was the most possible , and he started to get the most possible , and he started to get the most price possible .
The only true choice was with who , not when you 're , and not not not when you 're doing after .
And it 's really to play .
I 'm very intelligent students , and I do it for 20 percent of work respect .
And it 's not not less brilligent , because they 're not because they 're less diligent .
But why are they impensive , I mean , I 'm going to ask , " Would I do it right now ? "
" I should I spokill ? I have to think before the or of the career ? "
I 'm interrogative .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even though this implics that you don 't completely get the compitation that you have to get a vote to my own own .
And they really do it . They 're really important questions .
Now , the work , we 're lucky , as Carl , because the technology technology allows us to work every minute , every day , every single day , every every single day , in the world 's Hotel Randolpleasure .
I 'm talking about , there 's a corangle , and I don 't tell anybody where the WiFi works .
I don 't say , because I want to use it .
What means , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to work ? That 's going to work ? That 's going to keep , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son , you can play , with the cell phone , the Blackberry in the other , and the notep , and the notep , the ginoccurred .
And even though they are all spent , every minute we see our son , we 're also asking the game , we also asking , " Who would say , " Who would say to this called ? "
" I have to answer this email ? I had to get this letter ? "
And also when the answer is " no , " , this makes the experience of your son 's gone very different from what would be in other conditions .
So , by any part of the things , small things , and big things , and the materials of life , the materials and lifetime , the life is a question of choice .
One time the world was this : Ovtrue , there were some possibility , but not all this choice .
The world today is a slide today , the dilemma is , " Is it 's a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Shit 's Shit .
The positive souldn 't all of those negative ones .
And this choice two effects two effects effects on people .
The first , paradoxtially , it 's that produced paralysis that instead of liberation .
With options that the options of which choose to choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I 'm going to give you an example , a conduct study saying volunteers .
A columer had access to the data of the Vanlook at the gigantic of the source of pension , with about a million clients of the funny of the source of the source of the Vanlook at .
What she found found is that for every 10 solutions that is offered in more , the percentage of adesion of two percent .
With the 50 source of offering , there 's 10 percent in the adesions of the deallows , because ?
Because with 50 source of which choose , it 's males , it 's males to decide , and the choice is remainly remainly remainly .
And I 'm asking questions , and I 'm asking questions , and of course , and of course , I 'm going to ask .
You know , it means that these works from the old old old old food for cans because they don 't have enough money , because they will not have enough money , to say that decision is so ostics that they also lose the fund of the work of the dator of work .
It 's not going to talk about , they 're losing to five dollars from the dator of work , which would be able to be true .
So the paralysis a consequence of having trouble .
And I think it makes the world .
" And finally , to finish , the longer , or maionese , or maionese ? "
You 're going to take the right decision , if it 's the right , it 's why ?
You don 't want to choose the source crowd , and you can 't have the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second one is that we can get the paralysis , and do a choice , at the end we 're not sitting out of how we were in with less options of how we had been with less options of what I wake up .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with the condition of the condition , if you buy , you can 't be perfect , it 's not perfect , it 's not perfect , you would have been able to do a different choice that would be better . And what 's the alternative imagined industry , and the recognize of the choice , and the recognize , and the rise , and the rise , and the ridraw ,
And when it was a very good decision .
The choice is , the most choice is easy to be dispileasure of any drive option of the option of choice .
And there 's what economists call an expensive opportunity .
Dan Gilbert asked very well as the value we 're going to depends on what we 're going to depends on what we 're going to do .
And in the rest , when there are a lot of the options of the options of the alternative carternative , you know , and be less unso-to be less undreams of option that option is choice .
Here 's an example . I school with all those who who are not New York .
But it 's what you probably think about it .
There 's this couple of Hamptons .
A place of lussian .
It 's all over . Ottim . Ottim days . It 's all for them .
Nothing . But what he think he 's thinking , " Well , built , it 's Ausually . "
" Everybody my neighbors to Manhattan is . "
" I could talk about front of the front of the house . "
And I 'm pass two weeks , the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it .
The decreates the such deflows for what we have , even when the choice was old .
And the more options we have to look at , the more the characteristics that are going to be able to be against opportunities .
Here 's another example .
This vigneting tells us many things .
It 's going to be the moment , and maybe the living slowly .
But the most important point is that whatever you choose to do , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
The things that we don 't have a lot of attractive attractive what we do .
Terzo , it 's growing up to the expectations .
I tried it on my skin my skin .
I 'm almost always jeans .
As the jeans were only one , they were just buy and vestivestivestivesty , were dissively , only after they took them a living and worked a lot of times , started to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple when the old old old old the old old old old old old ones , " I 'm going to have a couple of jeans , this is my wrong . "
The commodity said , " Look , easy , easy , reaxed fit ? "
He wants with the bottle or with the bottons ? " Stonewashed or " " Aidwashed " or "
" Who wants to straight ? "
" Sott them want to the rock , " Bla bla , " Continured to elens .
I was sitting , and after a little bit , I was able to say , " I want the type of the only kind of the only kind of , " I don 't have idea what it was , so for a hour , I thought all of the jeans , then use out of the negotie , I would like to have .
It was the massive . I had the best choice .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was worse about the worse is that with all the choice , the jeans had to be perfect , jeans should be perfect .
I was wait . I didn 't expected me . I didn 't expected anything exciting when I just have a kind of 100 different , but when I 'm living 100 different , at least a kind of had to be perfect .
What I was going to buy , but not perfect .
After I was talking about this choice with what I was sitting in the front of the expectations .
The addition of the options in life 's life not going to increase the expection that these have respect to the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the
And this will produce less under the results , even when the results are good .
No in the world of marketing in the world of marketing .
Because if they knew , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth is going to this .
" The reason he was better when he was worse " The reason he was better when he was worse , he was that when he was worse was going to be able to meet .
And in the world , in the world we live -- opulent , industrialized industrialized , the citizens of perpection -- the synthrow that things are at the height of the expectation .
You 've never surprised because your wait , my aspectative , my aspectative , you are ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse wait , " Yes , you want . "
I mean , small authobiographic , which is really sitting and my wife is really stupend .
I wouldn 't do better , I don 't have accontent .
But you don 't always always always is a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of the jeans , when there 's just that kind of jeans is that when you 're not sitting , and you ask you , and I ask you ? "
" Who is responsible ? " The answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a sleep , and you ask you , and you ask the who is responsible , it 's the responsible , it 's the responsible to you .
You would be able to do better .
With available of available , there are not squeen for the insuccessful .
So when people are taking decisions , even though the result is walked , they feel the insuit and they 're sitting and they 're going to be in the same .
In the last years , the depression is expression in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but important -- this is the only important , but the important people have experiences of the depression of the depression of because the standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the colate is their college .
So the final result is that we 're in general , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you remember .
This is the official dogen , what we all take for good and it 's completely falready .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than not not at that but that 's not going to have to be a little bit better than this is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm sure we 've superperperated by a piece of the level where the choice the best choice .
Now , from the political point of the political view -- I have been on the political point , the political nocity , the nocity is the following .
What 's allows all this choice in industrial society is the rich material .
There are many places in the world , and you know parecks , where the problem is not that they have been choice .
The problem is that they too poorse .
So the face of the face that I 'm talking about is a mal-being exclusive , recognize societies .
And what does deprimate and array is this : Steve Levitt talked to you about how those expensive and discovering and discovering seats for bucky . It 's a sphere .
I mean these choices , complicated and dispendispendispending , it 's not just inuseful .
They 're saying to the landscape .
They do it worst worse .
If a little bit of what in our societies is going to choice was reversed in those where people have too powerful , it would be not just the way to be able to improve , but also our life .
That 's what economists call a pareting pareting .
A redirection of the redirection ago , not just to be the poor -- because of this choice in exception that it back .
And to end , " Let , you can become all be what you want --
You know , people of culture , you think , " What does that fishing ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get to a boat a boat . "
" A imagination imagination , a limited of the world -- "
I 've interpreted it , at the beginning .
But then , I realized , I realized that that that fish the long knows .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you eat the boat , in the way that , " all of the freedom , it 's not the freedom .
If you 're going to be the bocket in the way that it 's possible to be defy .
Accer the paralysis , and you 'll reduce the well-being .
All they need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too much , maybe even for the fish , and it 's sure for us .
But the assumption of some symbolic symbolic symboard and , for the rovement .
Thank you very much .
