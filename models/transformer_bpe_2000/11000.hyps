And the year I showed these slide to show that the glacial glacial , which for almost three million years of the 48 of the United States continental continental , you have the United States continental continental .
But that 's the floor of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice .
The calcalculus is , in a way , in a way , cup of the global climate system .
You can be slight-up and reverse it .
The next slide is going to be a carlated carlated on the last 25 years .
The ice ice of ice , the ice of the red .
And as you see , you extend to the blue .
That 's the ice in inverage , which is reverse , that you can realize .
You can see that the ice ice ice ice ice , of five years , of five years or more , is like sangue , which is like sangue , which is , from the body .
In 25 years , it 's spent by so ,
This is a problem because the whole scale is the whole three-threatened around the ocean artical where there are huge of coal congelated that , slight-up , switches , they 're transformed in metimes .
I spect to spect the atmospsphere , the quantity could be global warming , that quantity could be rading , superfored this point of not around .
In some laghes in Alaska , the metry is already rebulating out of the water .
The professoresse Walter Walter of the Alaska of Alaska , a team pressed with a basement of the scored scored .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : I 'm going to be .
A reason is that this third of the Groenland from the North .
This is a remain regime .
And the brought it never reached them .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the sud-west in the Greenland .
If you want to know how you know how to do the favor of the ice of ice , here 's where you reach it , here 's where you reach it .
These corrents are rent rents are .
Another of the planet : Antartide , the biggest block of the planet .
The month , the month have dichieved that the blood of the ice is negative , and that Antarcttarcttarcttarctttarcttops , is particularly rapieces , is particularly rapid in the scientist .
Equeen in six meters of the across the action of the action , like Greenland .
On Himalaya , the biggest block of ice , you see new laghes , which few years ago were gaciaced .
The 40 percent of the world 's remember half of the world 's population is going to the wind .
Sulle Ande : this ice is the source of the water of the populable of this city .
The brought is increased .
But when it diminutes , the same accepts of the pounds .
In California , the neve on the Nevada is diminuge of 40 percent .
The crisis in crisis .
The predictions , like you read , I 'm free .
The growth of the world 's popular to a night of the incends of the incends .
The environmental disaster are clear out of the normal and without precedents .
Four times more number number of years , in the last 30 years , you know , 75 .
This is a whole thing that is a whole thing .
If you look at the context if you can see the context .
In the last five years , we add 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours of CO2 , 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the Pacient area of the Pacient , from the American , from the Americans , and both of the subcontinent , where there 's a sould-oxygen , where there 's a radical impoverithygen of the oceans .
Most of global warming , together to the deforest , which is 20 percent , is the 20 percent , is the use of comcomics .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worst .
The United States are one of the two countries with the most emissions , together at China .
And it 's proposed to build a lot of other coal .
But we 're going to have a change of direction .
These are the projects of the last few years , and some projects of the real real real real real .
And every way , there 's a politics in our country .
The carbon industries and the oil of the oil and the last year for the last year for the last year for coal , which is a simb .
And that picture I remember something --
I see Natale , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion sons of the coal scories .
Maybe you saw it sounds .
This is the most flow of the great flow scories in America .
It 's successful around the Natale .
The public of one of the coal industries of one of the coal industries was this .
Video : Actually , the carbon is a bunch of a allegro and happy .
It 's abondant here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
Frosty the carbon is always more pulisted .
It 's a good , adorable , adorable and the workers are the workers .
Al Gore : Da is free part of the West Virginia .
The biggest society is Massey Coal . This is Massey Coal . This is his friendly .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'm going to be a clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they are talking about .
Al Gore : So Alleance for the Clim for the Clim has launched two campaiged figure out .
This is one of it , one part .
Video : Acccket : ALergy see the climate change like a serious of a serious mine .
So , we have to be investing a great amount of money in a very big sforce to make public reslict and conflict the truth .
In fact , the coal is not sport .
We think it 's a good -- it 's a good good .
So , not preocupatevs of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Acclean : Aclean -- you heard a lot of .
So , I do a glyon a ger structure to the coal of the carbon dioxed .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little rumorous , but this is the sucket of the coal technology .
The coal consumption is between the main re-scale main global warming , but the night is of the coal technology that you see it changes .
Do you have a : this is the odiern technology of the coal coal .
Al Gore : I finally , the alternative positive connects to the whole clock and the national ceasy .
Video : Comition : The America is in cription ; the economy , the national crisis , the national crisis .
The challenge that all : our dependence from the combustic combustic , as the coal and the importance .
Now , let 's have a new , audent , audent solution for use .
Repower , 100 percent of energy , in the 10 years .
A piece of reput the work of America to work , and help us to stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that bastic solution to solve our problems .
Repower . Scool .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Comition : Yeah , it 's to America .
One of the most faster ways to be able to the dependence from the comics of comics that kills our planet .
It 's going to do : The future is here . I mean , just a new energy , one of the energy .
What it 's two : two : Novoves for the retribes of bought bought .
Comment : Repower . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old proverbio says , " If you want to go to the sun , you want to go to the sun .
If you want to go away , you go together , you go together . "
We need to go away , speaking , speaking .
Thank you very much .
They swalked up the year at the LHC .
And I promise to the hornate to the car .
So , I did it . And for the other time , there were no , the LHC is the biggest experiment ever .
His the complex is to remember the conditions that were less than a million by the beginning of the universe -- until over the second of the universe --
And all of this is simply environment .
This is the car under Ginevf .
And we 're pictures these mini-Bang Bang Bang in the recently .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLATLATLATLAs -- is a 44 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLATLAS in building .
To the 10 tember year we have acceso the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAs .
It 's because of immense festeggs in the saving of control .
And it 's a picture of the first of particles that had done all the around of LHC , both , both in collision , with a part of LHC , and spread particles in the LHC , and spread particles in the reator .
In other words , when we see that image that image the 10 10 settember , we understand that machine work , which is a great vitting .
I don 't know if it was this to do exultremely , when someone went on Google and vide that the page was the beginning was this .
That means we have a cultural impact .
And a week after , there was a week after , there was a problem with the car , and they had to these dorrip here -- these dored dort .
These figure out 13,000 press when the machine machine works in power .
Now , the technicians between you 're going to be going to say , " It 's not true . I 'm too sotttles . "
And instead can do it because when they 're very freezes the cosidge of superconditions .
So , at least 271 , at a temperature in the inferior to the stars of the stars , these files can bring that corrent .
In one of the most noveils of the novemle magnetic in the LHC , there was a floor of fabor .
So the fidge rewarming , and 13,000 le-based , and 13,000 le-drive resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think these magnetic , and that 's more than 20 tons , and that 's spot of about 30 centimeters .
They are damn about 50 magnetic .
We had to take them , what we 've done .
We repristined and traveled .
Now , they are ritorning all of their soil .
And the end of the end of the LHC is is going to be again .
We 'll accendered , and we expect to get the data to juy or light , and we continue to be able to find what are the morning of the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these critical incidents reacting the dibate of the science and engineering of the science and engineering .
I think the fact that 's so difficult , I think it 's the limits , I think is this value of things like LHC .
I 'd like to conclude with the words of a scientist Inglens , Humprey Davy , which , imagine , in the defense of his public , his public , his public Michael Faraday , he said , " Nichael Faraday , " Nichael Fareas a , which is not very douldn 't really , which is about our monkeys are not very souldn 't really , and our mounds .
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to rethink about when , children , you play with the morning .
As you understand how to reach them and floor , and you take them , and then you get them , learned them , learned to think and resolving them .
The space is exactly connected to the way we understand the way we understand the world around us .
So , by information , by the information with our interaction with objects , together at my physical interaction , and my collaborator , and my collaborator Kalanithi , I started to ask me , I started asking a computer , when we use a computer , instead of the mouse , instead of the mouse , as we can make a well-up of the digital , and I could make a wassumption of the information with the hands of the hands of the hands .
and sistemulate our plinment ?
The question was so interesting that I decided to explore the answer , building the answer , building the Siftable .
In poords , a Siftable , a very big computer interactive as a bircool .
In poords , a Siftable , a very big computer interactive as a bircool .
He can move with hand , can see , " you see , " between them , " I feel the movement and they have a radio and a radio radio .
But it 's extremely , I 'm physical , like the morning , you can just music .
The Siftable of a new ecosystem for a new ecosystem for the digital information .
And as as as as physical , consciously , of the other , and as as as as as as as the physical , of the other , of the other , of the other , as we move , we can exploring new interaction .
I 'm going to do with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show of the video : if you includes it in a direction , the video rats .
These are interactive connecting to other .
If you look at them , you know what it 's their own around .
If they are circle , they notice , and they can act a little bit .
If they are circle , they notice , and they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power of the data , to example , " a color like that if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , we have three Siftable as secks and I can use them to the color in the clock , where you miss .
and I can use them to speak of the color in the central , where you missing it .
If we are too , we can put a little bit of it .
I also see the possibility of appractice , as languages , mathematics and logics of logics where people can try and see the quickly , and you see the results of the immediately .
Now , I 'm now --
This is a Fibonacuge sequence that I do with a equations of equations .
Here we have a word of words that is half between Scarabeo and Boggle .
Pratically , every turn a literally , in every Siftable , Pratically , every turn a literally , every turn to every Sift-hy-up , and while certainly words him .
And then , after about 30 seconds of it remised , and you have a new new new possibility to try to be .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came in the Media Lab , I did it , I did it , and I did it and I turned a video .
They were very much .
And one of the interesting things of this is that kind of application is that you don 't have to give the many of many instructions .
And I said , " What about the words , and they will sesare , and they sat .
Here 's how other people who try it .
This is our most young header , there 's the right there .
In fact , it was just to take them .
They just have a morning , for him .
Now , this is a very application of a interactive chart .
We wanted to build a tool for the appractice of Lui is Felix .
And it can inserve new characters in the scene , solving the Siften , solved the Sift-clean .
And it can inserve new characters in the scene , solving the Siften , solved the Sift-clean .
Here , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sole is source .
David Merrill : Now he took a track in the scene .
Video : The arange attor .
Bel ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah
So , in the Siftable and put up close close , can make the characters of the characters ,
Video : Bau !
I inventing their story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It 's a final story with final , and it can decide him how you slide .
DM : It 's a final story with final , and it can decide him how you slide .
Video : Video : Do .
DM : The last example I 've got time to show you is a crazy , realized of the recent , and extent music .
It 's a tool , recently , to recently , to walk and exeguess .
The Siftable here , basis on the base , based and the base .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose to choose .
And then you can inside these suons in a sequence of ble-bunch .
And modify it just doing a suund , " and a sequence . "
These are actually that you can control from the vive , as the reverbs and filter .
I attacks to a particular , and then including it .
And then there are the general effects like time and fly , which you applicate the whole sequence .
We look like it works .
Video : We 'll start a base in two Siftable , " sequence , " sequence , we put in a series , we add other base .
Now , I put a basement of basically .
Video : Now I add some percussions --
Video : And I 'm going to put the bacteria , so I can control the effect of the view .
Video : DM : I can know quencing the whole sequence , in a later or from one side .
Video : And I 'm going to add the basis to give more expression .
Video : I can see it 's the sequence " at the flight . "
So I don 't have to plan , but I can improvate , and it 's more cord or more cord .
And now , finally , I can do it sequence the whole sequence inclinking to the Siftable . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new interface to the whole faces and more soon as much more sometimes as well as our brain and correct .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this , and also some possibility that we try to bring out from the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that 's coming up to this new generation of the extremely designed to interact with the digital media , which will brings in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the now I 'm not going to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writing .
I 'm going to realize is my profession , of course , is more than that is , of course .
It 's also the love and the fash of my life .
And I don 't expect that I can change .
But , said , something particular , something particular happened in my life and my career , which took me to remember the whole whole whole recently ,
And the particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called " Manogy , Prega , and I 'm going to the books , and I 'm going to be a big , a very big , sensatisatisfic , became a big , became a big , three-interaction .
And the result is that everywhere , people are now , people are condence me how if I were condannoed .
David -- condanned , condanned ,
They don 't have to me now all worried and say , " I don 't have to be able to do better than it ?
Don 't you know , you know , you know , the lifests of life without power to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to someone ? "
that can be important to someone ? "
It 's rassure , you know .
But it could go , as a worst , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I wanted to say to the people -- I wanted to be a writing .
I was going to meeting the same based by the car .
And people said , " Don 't temes to be able to be able to be able to success ?
Don 't you know that the use of the rifigure out of the rified ?
Don 't you know , you know , the extracting for all life without the narrow , and dead on a cumoon of a floor with the both of floor of floor of falliment .
So , you know .
The answer -- the answer to all of these questions is : " Yeah . "
Yeah , I 've been putting all of those things .
I always had a purpose .
And I also have a lot of other things that people can not indeed .
As the algaxide and other things .
But , how do you look at the time , and I thought I was going to ask and I was the last mentially ?
Is it 's rational ?
It 's logical that anyone who has to be spent by a job that you 've been sent by a work that you 've been doing .
But what 's all of this particular in the impress creative advanced us to the health health health worky , in a way that other careers do do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemistry and I don 't remember a only in the time in the 40 years of activity where they were asked if she had a lightest to be engineer ?
Don 't have -- that block of the engineer John , how do it ?
Don 't work that , you know ?
Onestly , engineers like group , chemical engineers , in secos , drive , drive the reputation of being high .
We have a writers , we have enough this reputation , and not just the creative of every genef , we have this reputable reputting of all this .
And I don 't think about the sad of the magnificent of the magnificals of the magnificals that just in the 11th century , died , they die and often often .
And also the ones that are not suicipate data , they 're actually disdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisdisorder .
Norman Mailer , before you die , in the last interview said , " Ogn my book has killed me a little bit more . " One extraordinary floor of the work of life .
But we don 't bad cison when we feel because we 've heard these things really long-that in some way we 've been completely interized and accepted the none that creativity and the car , and the end of the art , in the end , at the end , the end of course , in the end , the end , in the end .
And the question I want to take all of the time today is : you 're accord with this idea ?
It 's good for you , because even looked from a centimeter of a distance to me , I 'm not good for all this supposed .
I think it 's odiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodist .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the next century .
I think it 's better incording to our big creative minds .
And I think , in my case -- in my case -- it 's a very dangerous of the way I was going to hear that I was going to feel the circustances in which I was in my career .
And that 's the real -- insom , I 'm quite young , I 'm just about 40 years .
I still have about four decadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadeca
And it 's very likely that anything I 'm going to write now , it will be judated by the world as the work that used to be able to the last book .
I 'm going to be , because we 're all more or less friends here -- is likely my biggest success is my biggest my biggest success is .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know , this is the gender thinking that 's taken one person to start to ball of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep going to keep this work that we call .
So , the question is , how do it , how do it ?
And so it looks , after many reflective , which the way to work to keep the way to writing is to create a psycholgical psychological protected , right ?
I have to make a very safety of me , which I 'm writing , and my natural natural , and my natural natural reaction that 's going to be able to do it . And as I was trying to look through time , I started to look through time , trying to look through time , trying to see if they could have the best society to see if they could be better society to see if they could have the best ideas .
in how to help people believe the creative people to gesting the inherent people in the creativity .
And that 's a research brought me to the old Great and the ancient Rome .
I 'm going to do it in the circle and then back back .
Nelil Great Great Rome -- people don 't seem to believe that creativity was from the men , OK ?
And it was thought that creativity was this spirit of the divine and that came from a few people are saying , and sunder , for reasons and soubder , for reasons .
And the creativity of the spirits of creativity " demons . "
Sock , wonderful , created to have a demon a demon that elargives from the saging .
The Romania were of the same idea , but called that species of the spirit .
The which is great , because Romanized , because Romanized , they didn 't really think a intelligent was someone particularly ,
They have to be a genius was this species of entity that created had been living in the middle of a study , a little bit like the Dobby , and that 's like the Dobby , and that came out of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of that work .
Emention--- this is the distance of which is the distance of which is the psycholgical psycholgical that you 're protect from the results of your work .
And all of know that was so that it worked , right ?
So , the artsts were protected by certain things , how to narcism , how do we don 't ?
If your work was except that 's extent , all of course , all of course , all of the way , all of course , they had been helped by this genius .
If your job , if your work , it was not all all ball ball bad , right ?
And all of all know that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people who concepile of the creativity in Occident for a long time .
And then Rinascient the Rinascient , and nacize this big idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe , and the misters and more more left space and more to the creatures and more to writing out of the divinity .
This was the main human rational and people started thinking that creativity was completely by the ishing of the ishing is completely by the ishare .
And for the first time in the story , you know , it 's reference to this or that artist like a rather than a piece of a piece of the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big herror .
I think I lose to someone , one one person to create a simple person to be like a recipient , the essence and the sigers of all the mists of all the divines , creative and inoscible and a responsibility to the humanity .
It 's like to be like to ingoes to the sun .
Deform and distores completely the ego and creates all of these inestible wait on the performance .
And I think it was this pression to destroyed the artists in 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it 's , and now ?
We can do it different ?
Maybe , to be a more extremely of the relationship between human relationship and mistery .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can 't cannot cancell 500 years of thinking in a 18 minutes .
And probably there 's people between the audience that would be laitycle scientific nurse on the nection of the nurse , you do people do squeen , and you have the projects .
I 'm going to convince you all of this thing .
But the question I 'd like to take is -- why no ?
Why don 't think that way ?
Because it 's more than any other thing that ever ever ever heard to explain the exasperformance of the creative process .
A process that , as anyone that has ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever , all of this , you know , you know , you don 't understand it .
And , in fact , it can sometimes it looks completely paranormal .
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poetesis , and that he 's 90 years , but it 's been a poetesis , but that 's been a poetesis , and he said that during his infancient Virginy , working out in the Virginia , and he was working on the car .
He said that was like a fragorous trenor .
And that was rotoling to her from the landscape .
And he heard it , because he was so much , because he was under his lands under his feet .
He said to have a solar thing to do that point and it was , words , " corring how a map . "
And so it 's going to be insequences , and he wouldn 't have to make a piece of card and a map enough , and a maker enough , as the traphion , as the hand and the wake on the page .
Sometimes , I can 't be faster , so correct and correct recorded and the round of the rotoling and the poem was rotoling through and the performs and the performs and the performs would keep up through the landscape . "
And then , there were those times -- this piece of the way , I 'll never have -- there were almost losed , right ?
So , he was the home and he was trying to the card and the poem was going to the moon , and he was a willing in , and then he said , and then he said , and he said , and he said , " which was like you lists with the other hand the floor .
He was the poem of the coda and the reput in his body and turned the page .
And in these cases , the poem is going to be on the perfect and the last word , but the last word at the first word .
So when I thought , I thought -- it 's crazy , is exactly equal , is exactly equal .
I don 't all my creative process -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a moon , and my way to work is ; I can see it 's about the same day , and I 'm going to go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go out .
But even , in my head , I 've been meet , I 've been meet against that , sometimes .
And I imagine that even many of you have the han .
You know , even if the work and ideas were to ideas to me from a certain of a certain crowed , I can 't extremely saperlo .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relationship to extra it , but , rather , rather than it , but , rather that do you do it ?
And so , as I look at the best example , the best contemporary contemporary that I have is the music in Tom Waits , which I 've been different years ago for a nal day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of the life was the incarnation of the artist , and trying to control , by trying to control these species of impulse , dominate these species of impulse creative extremely interized .
But then , he 's calculus , and a day day as he was drive on a car in Los Angeles , changed all for him .
And it was going to be faster and all of a sent sent , that 's very small framment of the chedia , which is inspiration , and the wants , and the wants , and the want , and the wills , and the desidentire , but it doesn 't know how to take it .
It 's not a piece of card , it 's not a math , it 's not a mathemath .
So I started to feel this species of old , and I 'm going to lose , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to sessional , and I 'll see .
I don 't really have enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of go to the panic , you stop .
I 'm going to be a whole process and fall of it , and it 's completely new .
And I 'm going to just the sky and said , " Scuses , I don 't see I idention ? "
" Do you know , you know , " Do you know ,
If you really want to be , you know , you know , as a more opports when I can take me clearly brought me .
And so , you 're important to important to be .
I got to disturbing Leonard . "
And his process process , he 's working on this .
I don 't work , the work was still dark as a always .
But the process , and the weight that was releft when the genius was releft when the genius , the genius of him , and the genius was remandyed to the other problems and liberated it , and I realize that didn 't have to be a whole thing .
but it 's just a lot of this peculious , wonderful bizarre a conversation between Tom and this strange that allow was not Tom .
So how to feel that story is that story is to change a little bit even the way I was working on and already me .
And this idea , I 'm going to writing , " Manogy , Prega , Ama , " and cads in one of the disperation that we 're going to do all when we 're working on something and we can 't start thinking that will be a disaster , which is going to think that 's going to be a books .
Not just just a bad , just the worst book .
And I started thinking about gecting this project .
But then I remember to Tom that talk about the air and try to it .
So , I got my face in the hands of the hands and I recognize my fall of the room .
And I said , " Sent , what 's both , you know if this book is not going to be brilliant , not be a brilliant , not be a very bad ,
Because how I see I 'm going to be able to be able to be I don 't have that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to give you and make your part .
Okay . But if you don 't , you know , you know , I don 't do it .
I 'll try to writing the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to do that I was recorded that I 'm presented to do my part of the North , " because of the end of the North Africa 's not so , OK , OK , and it was a soulder of the dances of the clear , and music that they were going to go on and high .
And they were always magnific , because the ballots were professionals and were wonderful .
But every so , so , it 's going to be transpent , and one of these artists was actually transcent .
And I know what I 'm going to talk , because I know you 've seen , at a point , a way , a performance .
And as if you stop , and the balloon the walking through a species of balloon , and he didn 't do anything that 's just just a different from the sunder , but all of the time , all sorts .
And at the improvement of not just as a human human human .
But it 's going to be accinated in the winitched by the smot of the divinity .
And when this is going to happen , you know , people know , people know what it was , called the name .
They know , God , and they begin to sell , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God , God , " God . "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note storics -- when the More invasy the Sph , the sud of the Spouth of the South , and the sounds of the Elah , Allah , Allah , " Olle , " that 's still , " that you can still feel in the corride .
In Spay , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , " Allah , " Allah , " Allah , " Allah , I 'm going to be , " I was a God of God .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem is the day , for the balloon the back , when you see and the swake , and discover that are 11 of Martedrive , and the walking .
It 's just a mortal with gran with gineye , and perhaps perhaps never going to be able to be able to be able to be listen .
And perhaps no one will be the name of God still as it , and what 's going to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most pain a creative life to make a creative life .
But perhaps not have to be so angotiate if you can 't believe , inside , the most extraordinary of your own being are from the same .
But created , you just think that 's data in the prested by a inimaginable squisity of this squisity of your life that you 've got to be a few other when you finally you 're going to be .
And , you know , if we think that 's this way .
And so I started thinking , and it 's sure , and it 's sure how I thought I was thinking about the book that I was going to public time , I 'm going to adversus , the dangerous , spently , I 'm going to the exisse of my great success .
And what I have to keep it when I feel feel electric , I feel that 's not going to have .
I don 't get you . It 's just your work .
It 's a deal of you represented to your part , any of it can be .
If your work is balloon , balloon .
If the divine , I asked me to do it , I asked up to leave some kind of wonderful wonderful , for a moment through your forced , then , " Os ! "
And I did the same tumor .
And " Ole ! "
I think it 's about it .
" Ole ! " And , even only for you have had a human head and tops tals to be taken .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I 've been talking about some of some of these designs , what can meaning and the discovery of new genes .
Now we 're starting a new fashion , we started digitalize the biology and now to the digital code of the biology , we 're both in a new phashing of biology , design and snail .
We always try to take big questions .
" What is the life ? " It 's something that many biologists I think they have tented to figure out .
We tried to be a different approved , reduced to the third of terms .
We 're digitalizing by the time .
When we sequenced the human genome was going to spent from the world of the world of the digital world of the digital world .
Now , let 's ask us : can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the most small species of those who can authorem in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little more small .
We can make a hair of the genes of the 500 of the 500 of about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his maps to his maps , is relatively simple answer to our .
I think that 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes we can eliminate , one at the time , is very improbbad that this can bring a living .
So we decided that the only only way to provide to provide some of these fundamental questioning to make some of these fundamental questioning to the components of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the " Posis , we can synthesize a cromosom ? "
And I can hear the chemical chemistry of these big molecules that we never able to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a cromosom , we can make a cromosom ?
A cromosom is just a piece of chemical material chemile .
The speakest that we are able to digitalize the life is growing to the exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , degree rather lently , but it 's better .
And our most recent results the recently , the exponential curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process process has require , by by the way , by by the biothic , we began to be first experiments .
But we found that we found that that is very difficult to be very difficult .
There are thousands of car clouds of the world that produces of DNA , of the longer of 30 to 50 to 50 lect-50 lect--herrors , more herrors are .
So we had to develop a new metodo to make these framments and correct these framments and correct .
And this was our first tentative , to go to the digital information of the Phi , 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills .
We designed the framments , effected the correction of the herrors and get a molecule of DNA , about 5,000 lectiny .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material , and we inside the bacteria , and we inserious in the bacteria , and we put this code in the viral particles and protection of virals .
The viral particles are , then you 're going to the cell , are back back and they distruted the Ecocket .
I 've been talking about recently recently the oil of the oil industries that their certainly compress that they have certainly compress .
They remember it remember .
We believe that this is a way that software can really build the same hardware can really build the same hardware in a biologist .
But we wanted to do things more in the largest things .
We wanted to build the whole cromosom of the bacteria .
I 'm more than 580 mies of code code .
So we thought we 've thought about the seven of the virus of the virus , so that we can change the cassed seven to understand what they are the components of a living .
The design is crucial , and if we start with the digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accurately standard was a herror for every 10 miles .
We found , resequency , 30 herrors . If we have used that original sequence , we never have been able to do it .
One part of the process is designed segments to 50 lect-50 lect-50 lecting of 50 lectiny , and the most small small small , and more small small , and more small than working together .
We actually see elements here .
You know , you know that we 've read that we put the floor .
And so , think that 's that we have a genetic code on four lettle-lected , and To , and Two .
Three of those lectest must them together 20 frights , and there 's a specific order to be a specific order to every hundream .
So we can use the genetic code to writing words , framework , pensive .
What we did in the beginning was the beginning was autographed .
Some of the fact that it was not poetry .
We designed these segments to simply make them simply to the exists .
There are the existence of them , and they put them .
And we started to heads , starting with segments , starting with segments of five to segments , unending the way to make segments of 24 mile , until the side of 24 mile .
And every step , we produced these sequenced in the south of sequencing that we 're going to create a very good process .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this looks like the tabellon a basket .
When we arrive these very long , more than 100 mile , more than 100 mile basis , not growing up in Ecocket .
You get the limb of the modern of the molecular biology .
So we 've been considered to be a few mechanisms .
We had to have a other mechanism called recombination , which in biology , which in biology is use to slim in biology .
Here 's a example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiohs , can absorbed three million rad rate .
You can see in the summmb as his romosom is destruct .
In 12 hours , 24 hours is exactly how it was before .
And Esists of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can seouth .
They can live under the vacuum .
I 'm absolutely certainly , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know ,
And in fact , the NASA has showed that this is .
This is a imagine of the molecule that we 've been doing these processes , just using these processes with design , just using the lower of inserious segments .
The lists listatically listically .
This picture was not wait with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule , that we can see it with a microscope with a microscope .
These are pictures that they couple of about six seconds .
This is the public that we did .
I 'm more than 580,000 lectest of code .
It 's the most great molecule of a definitely created by man .
It 's a molecular soon a molecular summming .
If you 're going to be in a careful 10 without spaces , we would like 142 page , just to transcequal this code .
Now , how do we work ?
Of course , traditions a virus is a young of young .
It 's a little more complicated when you use the bacteria .
It 's simple when it 's the ekariote as eucks like our : you can just extract the nucleo and inserve it . And it 's basically the process of clonation .
In the bacteria , the bacteria is instead of a cell , but we have recently demonstrate that we are able to do a transppiece of a cromosom by a cell of a cell .
We can refied a cromosom parting from a microbial species .
The two are different as men from the tops .
We add a few gene in the way , so we could choose to choose for this cromosom .
And then the sciolden with the way to kill all the protein .
And when we put it in the cells was stupend -- and opened our graph , you know , our graph , the new cell .
And we started thinking that we can 't go out , but we tried to spaces , but we tried to spaces us .
This is one of the most mechanisms of evolution .
We found that a lot of species have added a second or a third of a third , added by some of a hundreds of new tracks of a hundreds of of new trats .
So who think about evolution as a only gene at the time that modies is not understood of biology .
And Esists called me restrition of restrition that advanting digerism that advocity the DNA .
The cromosom that was in the cells .
The cell phone that we have inserito------crowed .
And it 's expressed , and remember the other cromosom as a material , and it 's masticated , and we 're rythrown with just the new cell and the new cell .
And it 's became became cut of the genes we 've been done .
And in a short time , all the careers of a species are going to be lost , and it 's transformed the whole new species , based on a new species , based on the new software that we inside the cell .
All the protein are changed , and when we read , and when we read the genetic code of the crazy is exactly what we 've been transfer .
Now , this could look alchemy genetic , but alters the software , but we can change things in the manist enough .
Now , I 've already explained that here 's not talking about genesis , but of the explane of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the Cambrise in which will be able to create a new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's enough obvious when we think about our necessity .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half a billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give example : I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each other , in 1946 , and there 's a year , there 's four .
We 're going to find the problems now to find food , fresh and repulse , medicinals and a half a million people .
It 's going to be more driving to be more .
We 're more than five billion coal , more than 30 billion baries of 30 billion baries of the olize .
That means millions of baries a day .
When we try to find biologic processes , or whatever , or any kind of a remains , it will be a huge challs .
We have to have the more of CO2 of CO2 from these materials that finishes in the atmosphere .
Al day , thank you to find scientific discoveries in all the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think are the components for the future .
The electronics industries only only just a dozen of components , and think about how many things are come out .
Our limits here are major and our imagination .
Now , we have the techniques , thank you very much of the synthesization , in fact , we can make what we call a combinatory .
We can make a big robot that can project a million cromosomes that can produce a million cromosomes at a day .
Think about it these 20 million different different or to try and get a very different processes or to try to be to be a little , and then , and then , and we can change , thank you , thank you , thank you , thank you very much biology , and create more biology , and create more biology .
And it 's just a standard standard .
We can choose to be a chance of survive , production , production , chemical or carburbing , production of the etc .
This is a few of some software programmed on that we 're working on to be able to be able to sen us and design species .
Well , we don 't know how they will be .
We know exactly coms is their genetic code .
Now we are concentrate on the carbon of the generation of the generation .
You also see you that extract it was a finished by grate , it was a finished .
We have carbon secondly , and third generation that are going to use a coal of the most treatment of the high , as a high or different butanol .
But the only way the biology can have a big impact without cat the cost of the cost of the food and limited disponed the CO2 months that we 're working on the CO2 in matter , which we 're working on the cell that can add the cell that can add the coal of generation in about 18 months .
The solar solar light with CO2 is a metodow -- but in our discoveries .
This is a organism that we described in 1996 .
He lives in the ocean profound , about 2500 meters of deep deep in the ocean .
They put out of CO2 , using a molecular crazy as a molecular source of energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can incancer CO2 , which can be translate , to be translamed , convertil that CO2 in carbon , to drive this process .
So , we think we can be able to be able to be able to increase what the question of the base is , " which is life is Not , real ethy -- we have the modity of remains the entire industria goal of re-to-oil industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where you can 't do it ?
It would be a main the car of energy .
And we 're working on the same metods to create vaccines .
You see this year with the influence , we 're always back to a year , and with a dollar , when it 's a dollar in the right .
I think that 's going to change building fighting combinable in antician in anticipate .
Here 's how the future could we start to look at change , now , the high of evolution , accelerating the evolution with batters , archaote , and finally , and finally , and finally , and finally inside the ekey .
We 're so as as the best people .
Our is to do it , so that 's to live enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
And I 'll be going to show you , the most rapidly possible , some fundamental work , some fundamental work , the new technology that we 've taken to a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a local environment that you can interact is to the local level that remote with a huge amount of data .
And here we are seeing a lot of photos of photos with a photos , and continuous , to a quote , disponing the images of images like .
And it doesn 't matter how big amount of information we see , how are these are big these are big collected or pictures .
Most of the photographs , but this is a digital scansion , but this is a provide from the Biiiblic , and it 's reentered in 300 megapixel .
Not a difference because the only thing that 's limits prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel in any time . It 's a very flexel in any time . It 's a very fleximage .
This is a whole book , example of data , I don 't images .
This is the Dickens of Dickens . Ogn represented a chap .
And to show you that is just a test of textest and not images , we can do something of this is a real representation of a representation , not a photos .
It could be a way of a little artificial book to read a book .
I don 't have to be advice .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the Look at the Look .
Every imagine is the beginning of a section .
And it 's going to you to have the pleasure and the beautiful experience of a review or a quote of a crazy , which is a lot of a cool .
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of the Look at the Look .
We created a fasules a fasules -- much more than that is because it 's a normal in a normal public -- and we 've been involved .
If you want to see the careful of this authomobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even specific specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We 're going to be able to put it up , and in the pounds and other downniture , not have to be necessarily .
Naturally , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if we don 't know , we have to give it in this camp .
These are all the streets in the U.S.
So now we 're going to be something else .
This is actually actually from the view of the web ; you can see .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual computer in the computer very interesting computer in Noah Snavah Snavah Snavity of Washington , with the Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Msoft Rick Steve Sezeliskels .
And it 's from the Web , gests from Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can spent from a picture of the other and have this kind of experience to reple .
But the space of the space of the space here has actually a meaning .
And the algorites of the computer recorded of the computer registed these images together , so that we have to have places in the recorresponding to the Roccial , all of the neighbors , and you 're sought-scaces -- are you have been waitches .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some examples .
I want to spend up a original data of Noahhhyet -- and this is from a precedent of Photosynth that we did it works for the first time the first time the extremely , the technology that is really the city that is really the clear behind technology , the technology , the Photosynth . And it 's not necessarily , and it 's not necessarily realize .
We had to worry about the laws of the laws and saying .
This is a rebuild Notre rebuild Notre Dame picture of the Flickr . Bast digitate Notre Dame in Flickr and you get images of the fields , other fields of these arants , other field of these arants arants of these arants arants of these arants arants of this model .
So , I got all images , and they 're all all college to the space space .
And it 's possible to navigate this way .
You know , I never had thought I 'd never thought about the end of the Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying this kind of across here .
I think you see that it 's a lot of different types of different kinds of photocameras , from those of the photocameras , in the SLR , a number of meaning , they put in this environment .
And if you can , I prove to try to try to try to try to try to those more strange .
Many of them are block , etc .
And it 's a few of photographs , I 'm going to be a photographs -- that 's a very .
This is a Notre Dame registed .
We can spent from the poster to the vision of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do with the social environment . This is taking data from the entire memory -- from the entire memory , from the point of vision , from the point of vision , from the point of vision -- and college all those data together .
All those pictures become together , most of the som of the parts .
You have a model of the entire entire the entire of the land that emerge .
Think about this as a cool of the work of Stephen Lawler on the Earth virtual Earth .
It 's something that grow up in complexity , and the people who use , and the lizens that the lizens of the car .
And the picture of them are sweet with other people .
If someone is the idea of the idea of the saying , my name , my photos of the Notre picture of Notre Dame improved all of those data , and I can use how to inside the moment of all those data , and I can use the mothththers , and you can use the whole thing else , using the universe , and have a clelele-mos-mot cut out of the red red and red out of the critical --
And in fact , a consequence of all this is very very extremely elaborated in the early , collected of the earth , and you 're not just to achieve and similar satellitarian and similar , but from the memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software is that you can do is that a certain point , in the next few years , all the time , in the next few years , all the whole world 's going to be going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to do is that you can do it .
AA : Yeah . What 's doing is doing in the most of the tradly .
It 's creating the hyperlink , if you want , between images , between images .
And it 's doing it in the base of images .
And the thing becomes very interesting , if you think about the remember of the semantic information that 's semantic .
As when you do a research of images on the web , digit 's a frase and the web on the web of the picture of the picture .
Now , what happens if that pictures you have all the vote pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of semantity and the amount of recognive that 's really huge . It 's a classical classical classical classical .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible .
BAA : I 'm very much .
One of the main piaces when you travel and one of the deliveries of the research of the research of the ancient , who have not dimented the anti-tradimented , who have the past in the wind , the wind of the floor , the wind of the plant , is , by drive the floor of the plants .
And the fact that sciamans Jaguar travel of the Great the Via Lattea , or that the model of the Inuit are still colors , or who are in Himalaya , the good death of Dharm , to remember the important thing that the world 's going to remember the important thing that the world 's going to be able to be in the idea that we live in sense , but it 's just a sense of the idea that is ,
The consequence of a particular screatch that our strops that our strops is done , well , many generations ago .
And of course , we all share the essential trats .
All we all have . We all procrease .
We are suggests of the beginning .
We need to deal the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprised and ballide ,
We all have a art .
What is the particular of the canzone of the canzone , the ritm of every culture of every culture .
I don 't matter that are the ininforest of the Borneo , or the Vodoo , or the Haiti , or the window of the Kaisut in Kenya , Curnail , or a wake of the Anysstent , or a wake of the Saitor , or a wood of the Saititor , or , or a wind .
He was my company in the journey in the desert of a month ago , or a high of the cyak , in the Everest , demand in the world of the world .
All of these places , they teaching there are other ways of that exists of thinking , other ways of the model of thinking , other ways of the world .
And , if you reflected a second , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
Insit , my myriathuge of cultures of the world create a spiritual and cultual that 's where the planet is important to the planet and cultual well-being as the planet as the ragela pheroosphere .
And you can think about this ragela cultural as a critical , and you can define the som of all the concepts , som , in mites , texs , in the ctually , ideas , inspiring , inspiring , inspiring , intuition from the humans of the consciousness of the consciousness .
The thnosfhere is the great patrimonium of human human human .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how to inquiss .
And because the biosphere was a very much more rapidly , it 's happened to the etnosfera and purpose too much .
Noil biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species was in the oref of the extinction , because it 's falready , or the most apocalphyss -- in the most apocalphysical -- and you can 't even even even even more than the power of the critical -- that 's the most otimistry of the world 's been inside .
The indiction of all this is , of course , the perdrive languistic .
When you were born , they were 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not just by a vocabulary , or a series of rules .
One language is the sprap of the human spirit .
It 's the midle of every culture of every culture is revered in the material .
Elacguy is a forest of the mind , a boin , a thought , a thought , a spiritual system .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we seat at Monterey , at least half is not more supply in the orecchies .
They don 't see children , the children , which means , at less than not wasn 't walking something , which are already deaths .
What is there 's more trils of being the silence , of being the last I 'm going to talk a language , not so that we can 't have a way to transmitted the pattern of the tiny or of the ancient or of the ancipes ?
This orring was the state of someone in some of every two weeks , every two weeks , every two weeks , a moon and door and door and door in the cloud of a ancient language .
And I know someone of you say , " Don 't it ?
The world would not be a better place if we talk about all the same language ? " Benissim , then we talk about it .
We talk about kogs .
You know , a lot of something means that it means not to talk to your language .
And I would like to do you make a journey through the journey .
a little journey in the etnosfhere for a little bit of what we are lost .
Many of us dimented that when I say , " different ways of exists , " I really think of exists .
We can make example of this bimmmor Barasis , in Amazonia sector , the popular of the anacon the west cheeast of the saces of the sacred bats of the sacred bacet .
It 's a popular that 's not able to be able to be able to be blue , because the cell phenced because the exta time of the forest , which depends the popular , which is the popular of the forest .
They have a strange language and a monial rules , detect " exameous languistic : you have to spot a person who talks about a different language .
And all of this radical radical in the past , yet the particularity is that in these families in those families that are about six or seven or seven , and seven multiple , no one basically basically a language .
They get to listen and then start to talk about .
We can make one of the most interesting thing with which I lived , the Waorld , the Waorn Ecuador , a incredible popular that has had the first contatts in 1958 .
In 1957 missionaries have tented a common contact a herror .
They did not have been doing the photographs that they were rying them in pose that were used to the pose of the forest , that this popular of the forest , and that this popular had never seen anything of bi-dimensional bi-dimensional bi-dimensional bi-dimensional .
They 've been telled to the ground , they turn the research of a or a challenge and , not find nothing , they concluded that it was the diavels of diavels with the missionarian , and they kills with the slolots of the laweld .
But the Waorani doesn 't just killed the straniests .
They killing between them .
The 54 percent of the mortality was caused by them .
We 're sites to be realized two death of morrow and when we 've been sought to know , they 've been a lot of them was invected , and then they were actually death it , and then they killed it . And then they kills it .
The clacers were able to recognize the urina of 40 step and recognize the species .
In the first 1980s , I was assigned a very interesting when my professor of Harvard asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti in the intruly secret of the Duvard of the Duvice of Duvalier Macoutes and the Tward Macoutes , and impossed me to make the zombiombios .
So to give a mirhor , I 'd have to understand the Vodoor , and that Vodoo and the Vodoo is not magnia .
It 's rather than a complex complex , of the world .
Many interesting interesting .
If I ask you to ask you to tell me about the big religions of the world , what do you do ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Sharian Africa is not a religious of religious religious . And instead of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious company of these religious complex , which is the tragic of the tragic ,
What makes the voodow is the voodoor is the intense of life and death .
So , the view of the spirits .
And the spirits can be invest by the Grande Acqua , they answer the dance of the dance and they replaced temporary to the way that for a short of the way that for a short became .
So , so , the voodoodos to say , " You can be a little white white bunch .
We say , " We define in the temple and diventire . "
And from the moment that you 're sitting , is the spirit that you can do you do the mal of the mal ?
So you 're incredible events , you know , the following voodoor in the state of the power that touch a rather shows of the power of the power of the power when it 's made in a state of the body when it 's catalyzed when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme .
And all the populations with the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary are the Kogi of the Siwar Nevada , in the Colombia stric sector .
As the ancivilization that once a living on the planure of Colombia of Colombia in the clity of the conquista , the popular sitive crum that you can make the slide of the caibics .
In a drug continent , this popular , this popular never been conquire from the spages .
And so , in fact , they 're government by a clery , but their formation is decided .
The young people come out of the families , and live in a few three or four , and live secreated in a good world , and they live in a good world , and the base of the base of the glaciacilaciaciaciacilaciaciacaciacacross the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base in a base of the base of the base of the base of the base in the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the
Two drugs that reduce years , I 'm going to reduce the nine months of gestation that translate in the mother of the mother , now are metaforically in the Great Mther .
So , so , so they 're accultural values of their society , values that their predicts to their predict and just their predict , they 're going to be able to say , equilibrio .
At termine of this incredible beginning , they 're improvement , and the first time in their own , in 18 years , you see a high . And in that across that across that accounters of the first wrong , when the sun of the first cut , when the sun of the beautiful , all that they learned in the midle , all that learned in its spend . The predict is a furn .
" I said , " I said , " I said .
It 's stupend . Now it 's to you protect it . "
They call them the most of the most and saying that we , fratels , we are the collies of the destruction of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think about the indeed polations and invote , we call Resseau and the old old story of the noble became , which is a razy in his simplicity or magazine or magazine or magazine or , and we say that these populations are more closer to the war of us .
The indeed indebults are not slow-indebults from nostalogy .
There 's no space for these things in the palures of Astststat or in the gelids of the Tibet , but because of the time and you 've created a mistics of the Earth , and they created a mistics of the Earth 's based by a bunch of the bection that the Earth can 't be sotest because it 's infection of the war is because it 's infection of the humana by-confied , because it 's infection of the Earth is that 's going to be able to be able to be a very very very very close of the ground of the Earth .
What does it mean ?
I mean a guess of the Ande of Ande that the montiny is a spirit of Apu that 's a spirit of his destiny is going to be a human being , and it 's going to be a very different report , and it 's going to be a different , or that place or a girls of Montana , which is a bunch of the Montana , which is a bunch of the Montana .
And that 's the dimage of one or a mineral cycle is irrifying .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the report between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forest of the Columbia credding that the forest forests of the forests of the rest .
And what 's realized my friends Kwakiutl that believe that the forest credate that the forests are the Hukukuk and the stories of the paradies and the spirits of the paradies that live in the world , spiritures that live in the world , spirits that live in the world , spirits that are going to the Hamats .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different , you can start to understand some of their discoveries . We can make some of them discoveries . We can make this plants .
I walked this picture in the Amazonia Nororororcity .
Maybe some of you have heard of the ayahuasks , the most powerful sustained the world 's repertors of the sciamanic .
What makes it fascinating the ayahuasks is not the power of the sustainance of the sustainance , but his elements . It 's composed .
And in a longer , this launched a series of a bune , harmful , harmful , harmful , slightly binged .
To redrive the solar of the piece of the cool that alters a little bit of cool , but it 's miscreen with the leap of the coffee , and it 's a Psychotridge of the coffee ,
This plant contains , very much powerful , very similar to seroent , dimethoxyptamines , methoxyptamines .
If you ever see the Yanomami to the nass of the nass that do do do a different species , anched methoxyptamine .
Tirate that pollution on the nass is a little bit like being sparated by a fire spared by a fire and reef and reef on a mare of electricity . Risn 't creates a storsion of reality .
I was spected with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who waten the man who waten was psycheel , with his own own own own own own own own own own in Mexico .
I 'm not going to be a tamine of tamine , and you can 't tell these tripes because if you 're done , you can 't tell a lot of being holding .
It 's possible to be absumerely if you just lists with other sustainances that money money in the MAs .
Now , the beautiful : the beautiful , the beautiful die of the MAs , of the MAs , the same kind of necessary , the same kind of necessary . The question is , in a 80,000 species of 80,000 species of feet , as they do these two of a piece of 80,000 species , but if you have a lot of them , but if you fight a very cycle , but if you fight a real time , you have a lot of the parts of the parts ?
We use the great eufy of the prove and the herror , which can revehicle .
But if we ask the Indians , they will tell us , " The plants talk about " . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , the Cofan , 17 variety of ayahuasks , which is nected in the forest , and that our eyes will be in the same species .
If we ask them how do you say , " I thought , " I thought I was going to do , " I thought I was going to figure out , I don 't know all all of it ? "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night of lads and obnect a slide .
And I don 't have to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting to content the stams .
Now , [ [ applauses the problem is that also the ones of us that have cuor populs them are in the indigenes , but somehow reducts you to the real world of the story of the real world , and it 's alyzed .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it 's not remember for his innovations , but rather like the world , but rather like the was where we are stopped and we fasted and we have a lot of the biological and cultural accepted by the world . Now , the problem of the world 's not change . Now , the problem . Now , it 's not change .
All cultures , the secos have been involved in a dance for new possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Soux didn 't stop to be Sioux when they put from a part and free , and frectly like Americans have been Americans when they put out of the Americans , and calm .
It 's not the change or technology that minacts the integrity of the etnosfhere .
The during the floor .
And if you say , you know , you know that these are not cultures that these are not cultures to sleep .
They are creatures and dynamics , the existence of the existence of the identify of their adaptation .
And I think it 's discouple in the patria of the thinking of the thinking of the inequy .
a few na-called Sarawak , in the sud-asiath , a popular that has been libed in the forest , and now to a generation of the servites , and now to provide the servites of the rive and prostitution on the rive of the rive Borneum , where you see the light-based by the Borneo , where the Merian Cinese Merian Cinese , where the navels
You take the standing to reempive with the dream of the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that are coming up with the golder .
If we spot on the Tibet , where I 'm doing many research , you 'll see the during of the political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physical extinction of a popular , is condition to the universal , but the destruction of a popular , destruction of a popular , not just condition , but it 's not just condition , but it 's part of the development , because of the strategy of the development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet of the Tibet until you 're going to the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China through the Tibet , from the Tibet , from the Tibet , and just come to Lhhhhasa , but just came to Lhhasa , I realized what we feel about .
6,000 monuments sacridts in pollen and cenlists .
1.2 million people killed the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical to the Panchen Lama .
The means that it 's been killed to the temple of the Chinese invasion .
I was smote with Santity in Santity during the diexpasive diachieving the popular in Nepal .
He was a mother was regioned and his college was recognized .
And it was brought to a bunch of two years at the age of two years under the gonna because it would not live without him .
And the sister , which has been moved in reeducation .
A day has been a day , it 's been a fashion a fashion Mao and , for this transgression , was moving in seven years .
The Tibet can be insopatible , but the spirit of the popular is from the holding inside of the popular is .
And then , finally , all of it reduced to a choice .
We want to live in the world world 's monoothy or we want to take the world of the world of the so-ds of the different world ?
The great anthropologioga , before he dimented her to death that his biggest couple was that , in our modity was that , we can 't just see the whole gammous gammous of human imagination of human imagination of human imagination , but a day we 're going to be able to be able to a sleep , but one day we can see it .
And it 's equiet that our species is there for 60,000 years .
The Neolitics , which has given us the agriculture , which has done us to have a seed clusts of the seed clertaining the clery of the clery , creating the gerarching gerarching of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world has been 300 years .
And that 's a story of history , I don 't suggests that we 're going to all the challenge of the challenge that we 're going to be .
When you do these myria-cultures of the world is asked what we want to say to be , " Humans , answer to 10,000 different .
And it 's in these riskers that we all risis of being what we are : a conscious , which is a conscious , which has to make all the people and all the gardes of all the giardbs can figures . And there are great ways of hort . And there are great ways of the right of the things that we are ,
I walked this picture on the northern extremely , when I went to balthough I went to clean with the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and this man , Olaya , he telled me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The government canadn 't always been gentile with the Inuit , in the 1950 to stump our prematia , we have rinkils them in colonies .
The grand-of this man refied to go .
The family , I 'm going to his life , brought up all the arms , and all of his attens .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't temen the cold , the swait .
The packs of the origin were made of the origin were made of a caribalload balload .
The grand-of this man doesn 't fintimise from the night or from the cycle , and the public .
It 's sleep , it 's calculated the pantales in the skin in in the skin and defected in their hand . When you do you do it , they have the mounting a lama .
He 's sprhed on the points of this photos and when it was sunction , he killed a spot .
He wasn 't the dog and created a brilliant , with the cases of the claim , has a bleap , and it 's sleep on the balloon the balloon the balloon .
We want to talk about cavared with nothing ? [ Risn . And that , in different ways , in different ways , [ Applausi is the symbol of the popular of the world .
In the 1999 the government of the England has redied to the Inuit of a territory of a largest California and the Texas the Texas a together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavails .
It 's a thritoration . It 's a threat all the reamples .
One splends , I splends like a natione-state can remember with his popular .
And , to finish , I think it 's rather obvious at least who 's been in these crazon the planet , remote of the planet , remote that are not remote .
For someone is home .
They represent sections of human imagination that are treating the high of the time . And for us all of these children , like the dreams of these children , as the children , becomes part of the hope .
For finally , we have National Geographic Geographic , we never arrive .
We believe that the polemies --
[ Applauses , they 're not lost , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and perhaps the best institution to tell stories of the world . Ogn n month of the world . Ogn our sign month .
156 countries transmitted our television .
Our revilists from millions of people .
Our work is travel in the etnosfhere to bring our public in places of the wonderful cultural , which is revehicle , and hope , you know , hundreds of the central anthropology of the world 's exists of the world 's exists of the world 's exists of life , and multural in a world .
in which the saggeness of all the populations can contributed our well-being college .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you 're already hearing and I 'm going to give you some of the connects , in case , in case not them .
I want to start with what I call " the dogma official dogma . "
The dogen official of what ?
The dogen city of all society Western society , the dogma city : " If we want to massive city , " If we want to massive city " The way to do is massive liberty . "
The reason is , from a late , in fact that liberty is in the same one , is precious , use , essential , essential , essential humans .
Another is in fact that if we are libes , each of us can act for all of us can act all be , not one that 's going to be , no one that 's going to our name .
The way to massive liberty is massive liberty .
As the choice people have , more libed , and most libed , and most of the liberty is their benefits , most of the benefit is their benefit .
This , I think , it 's so foundly readicated in society that nobody 's got to put it in the bbbbban .
And it 's also profound in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has realize .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly great .
I lost a simple note to injumped .
And my supermarket , there are 175 condition , without content the 10 variety of the extracks , and 12 hundreds of them , and 12 huge that you can busams a number of condition in the including constance of 175 , no one of the 175 of them are in your degrees .
Here 's the supermarket .
And then you go to the negotior to comprate a stereo : casse , slector , lefer , radio , radio .
And in this single negotior of electronics , there 's a big number of components .
We can realize six million and a half of different combinations that there are in a negotial .
You have to love that there 's a lot of choice .
Altri camps : the world of the communications .
As a child , when I was a child , you could get all the wish of the telephone , and they were sitting , and they were in the mom Bell .
And he was re-floor , it doesn 't understand .
One consequence of that , between the other , was that telephone was that 's never roped .
These tempts of the time .
Now , we have a variety of telephones , especially between the phones .
Here 's the cell phone .
My favorite is the midle , the MP3 , tops of the nass , and foreign in the ball .
If you don 't have seen it in the negotior under home , you 're bought to make it .
And what is the end of the end is that people in the negoties and it 's what is is . And you know , it 's the answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell that doesn 't do it .
So , in other things that are much more important than the people that are very important of the same explosion of choice .
Assistence sanitary : It 's not going to be the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor , what you do .
I mean , you won from the doctor , and doctor says , " OK , we could do do a hard , or you can do it , or you can do it . " As these benefits . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Dottore , what I should do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , and these risks , and these risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you can see it , " Dottore if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I don 't . "
The result of the result of the lab of the disease , expression that does it seemate it looks like a beautiful thing .
But in fact , it 's not that one is that one of the slight-taking decisibility to someone that 's something , you know , you know , nothing -- and almost certainly , and so it 's not not a -- and so it 's not very much .
There 's a huge marketing of products , direct people like me and you , and you know , you know , you know , it 's not a sense , because we can buy them .
But if we can 't understand them , why do you don 't understand them ?
The answer is that they want to doctor to call the doctor for ask to make it required .
And what is the fundamental as is our identity that 's ever a choice , as you see in this visual jobs , like you can 't make the children . " We don 't want to force the right time . " We don 't want to be a more identity : We need to invent .
And we can reinventing how many times we have to be .
The means that every morning , at the right right , you have to decide you that kind of person want to be .
I 'm going to be spect the family , a time time , a common time , under the community , under , and it was that you can be able to be able to be .
The only only real choice was with who , not when , and even when , and even what to do after .
On the day , all is really to play .
I mean , I 'm very smart , and I do the 20 percent in less than a time .
And because they 're not brilligent , not because they 're fligents .
but why are they impensierites , I mean , " I should sleep , " I would say , " I would do it now ? "
" I should have later later ? I had to think before you 're going to the boat or the career ? "
I 'm interrogatives .
And they try to answer to these questions , even if this implessy doesn 't completely completely the complionies that listen and I don 't get a beautiful vote to my exam .
And they have to do it . I 'm really important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , as Carl soon , because the technology of the technology , allows us to work every day , every day , every day , from every day , in the planet , in the Hotel Randpattern .
And in the parently , there 's a corner , and I 'm not going to tell you , where the WiFi works .
I don 't say , why I want to use it .
What means , this incredible liberty of choice that we have to work on the work ? That 's the work of the work , we have to work or no .
We can go to see our son son , with the cell phone , with the Blackberry , the Blackberry in the other , and the ntexture .
And even if I are all sorts , every minute that we see our son , we are also asking the partses , we are also asking this called ? "
" I have to answer to this email ? I had to get this literate ? "
And also when the answer is , " no , all this makes experience of your child 's very different from what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the look , small and big things , small and large materials and the lifting of life , is a living in life ,
One time the world was this : Ovue , there were some possibility , but it was not a choice of choice .
The world of today is that : The dilemma is : " That 's a positive , or negative ? "
The answer is South .
The positive slide slide , so I 'm going to talk about the negative .
And all this choice , all this choice two effects on people .
The first , paradoxsically , is that produces instead of liberation .
With the options of the options that wake up , becomes very difficult to do it .
I 'm going to give you a meaning : one study of floor of fly fly .
A clear college has had access to the data of the Vang , the giant society of pension , with about a million clients in 2000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of the two percent .
With 50 percent of offered , there 's 10 percent in less than adesions , when they are are just five percent . Why ?
Because with 50 of floor of which wodd , is maledclear , and the weld is remains .
And I 'm going to ask , and I still questions , of course , and of course , I 'm going to ask ,
You know , it doesn 't mean that just these work on the old hands of the hands of people are going to be sun because they don 't have enough money , it 's so ostics that allows also , that 's so ostics are also so othic of the work of work .
I don 't talk , they 're losing , they 're losing to five dollars from the dator of work , which would be bought .
So the paralysis a consequence of having a lot of choice .
And I think that makes the world .
" And , " And for the finish , the ketches , senape , senape maionth ? "
You know , if it 's going to take the right decision , if it 's for the eternity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong cut , and neppurs the condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can get the paralysis , and do a scale , we 're not sodried by how we would have been in the result of how we would we have been with a free floor that I wodds .
And that 's for the reasons .
One of these is that with the tants of those is that wodds , if you buy , you know , it 's not perfect , it 's easy , it 's easy . And what 's happening is that it would be better . And what 's alternative is that the alternative extremely images that it would be better . And what it 's the extremendous choice ,
And even when it was a decision .
As there are , more is easy , more is easy , easy it 's insudden that is insodly involume .
And , there 's what economists called the economist-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has been very well as a lot of how the value we see things about the things that we see that depends on what we 're going to do .
In the rest , when there are many options , is easy to represent the careful cars of the alternative scarted and be less sodwimming , and be less than the option that is choice .
Here 's a example . I 've all all the ones that are not in New York .
But it 's what probably think about it .
There 's this cople to the Hamptons .
A place of lusse .
It 's floor . Oten day . It 's all for them .
Not . But what he think he 's said , " Well , malaria , it 's Again . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan is . "
" I could talk to me just to talk about the home . "
And it 's two weeks , as a few weeks , every day -- every day -- every day -- the chance of park where it wants .
The deminud-opportunity is to be the floor for what we have , even when the choice was old .
And more are the options that we 've been to look , more the careful characteristics are going to be recognity .
Here 's another example .
This jobs us tells us a lot of things .
We talk about the moment , and perhaps of living lently .
But the most important point is that any of you choose , you can see it , you won 't do other .
The things that we don 't wood the things that can make less active , which can make less exactive what we do .
Third point : spiral growing of the expectative .
I tried to my skin bunch a new couple of jeans .
Aceans always , jeans .
One time , the jeans were just a kind of , comprecord and vestivestivestivestivestivestivestiated , just after you know , they were going to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple when the old old ones were , and I said , " I 'm going to give me a couple of jeans , this is my wrong . "
And the commoved said , " Let wants to slim , easfit , relaxed , relaxed ? "
Who want to make the cernist or with the bottons ? "
" Who want to be strapped ? "
" Sotble is going to be a ble or ble , " Continured , " Continured it .
I was sbalordit , and after a little bit I was going to say , " I want to say , " I want to do it , " I want to be a very , so for a hour , I was going to be able jobs , and then used to the jeans , and with the best painting , I was going to be .
It was the massive . I got the best choice .
But I felt worst .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worst is that with all of the choice of the weld waaait were very high , jeans had to be perfect .
And I started expectative . I didn 't expect . I didn 't expect anything except when it was just a kind of 100 different , but when I liked , at least a kind of a perfect .
What I was going to do was good , but not perfect .
After I was sitted with what I was trying to do with what I was insodded in the wait .
The options of options in life of the people don 't do that these are the expected of the options of the options of options .
And this is going to be less sodrive , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing in the world of marketing .
Because if I know , I don 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth of the truth .
" And he was better when he was worst , " The reason you were better when he was better when you were the worst was that when he was worst possible .
Ost day , in the world that we live -- opulent -- opulents , industrialized citizens with the expection of the perspection of the expectation .
You never have surprised because your expectations because your expectations , myand you 're ingigantite , you are ingigantite .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is : " Basse , " Well , " Yeah , you want . "
I mean , I mean , I mean , I 'm really spot , I 'm really spot and my wife is really study .
I won 't have to do better , I don 't have a content .
But it 's not always a good thing .
And finally , a couple of the compremodel a couple of jeans is that when you 're not sitting , and you ask , and you ask , and you know , and you ask , and you know , " Why do you ? "
" Who is responsible ? " And the answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What can you do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a bunch a insoddisasassumption , and you ask you who is responsible , is the responsible , is the responsible , you know .
You would have to do better .
With hundreds of variety , there are no slightly .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is , you know , you know , you feel slowed and date the collies , and they give the collies .
In the last years , the last few years , is explose in the world industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important , important -- of this is , but important -- of this depression is right that people have experiences because the standard are too high .
And when they must explaining this situation is their collies .
So the end of the final is that in general , we 're better , obgously , but we feel worst worse .
Let me remember .
This is the dogma official , what we all take for good and it 's completely falready .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than I haven 't really have to be better , but by this is not sell .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been supped by a piece of the lifested scale in which choice our lives .
Now , from the political point -- I 've been finished -- from the political point , the nocycle is the following is the following .
What 's allows all this choice in industrial society is the rich material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , in which the problem is that they 're not very choice .
The problem is that they too pop too .
So , the face of the equal I 'm talking about is a disease of modern , remember the Western remember .
And what it does depriming and array is this : Steve Levitt talked about how those are inuseful . And it 's a floor .
I mean these choice , complicated and dispency , it 's not just inuseful .
I 'm adtelling the purching .
They make it worst .
If a little bit of what in our society allows , it was reversed in those where people have too powerful , it would be not just their lives , but also , we would be just the lives .
This is what economists called a better pareting .
One redistributed redent is good at all -- not just to the poor -- not just to the poor -- it 's cause there .
Father , " Famazing , you can become all that you want , "
You know , people think , you think , you think , you need that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make it nothing in a bunch of wind . "
" United States , a limited vision of the world -- "
And I 've been interpreted so , at the beginning .
But then , thinking , instead , I realized that that fish the longer .
Because the reality is that if you eat the bottom , it 's how it 's possible , " you don 't get the liberty . You don 't get the paralysis .
If you take the bottom , you know , it 's going to deminuliitely defation .
Atented the paralysis , and you reduce the well-being .
All of all have to a free .
This is almost certainly too much , perhaps for the fish , and it 's just for us .
But the asn of some symbooks is a recipe for infectious infectious and , for the rovine .
Thank you very much .
