I 've shown this last year , and I showed this slides to show that the artics glacial , which for almost three million years had the size of the 48 million years had the United States continental , it 's retrees of the 48 percent .
But this subjects the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice of ice .
The artics of the artics heat is , in a sense , the heart of the global climate system .
You can expand of inverinter and you reverse .
The next slide is going to be a quick card on on the last 25 years .
The ice lots of lots are signed in red .
You see , you see , they expand , you see , you see ,
That 's the ice in invernal , which is re-summer .
You can see that the ice ice ice ice ice lower , five years or more , it 's like , five years or more , it 's like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood .
In 25 years , it 's been so , in 25 years ,
This is a problem because the warming is the ice that the ice recognized the ocean where there are enormous quantity where there are huge amount of coal that , the switches , they get transformed into the metrics .
I repected to the totality of the atmospherical rewarming , that quantity could double , superty this point of not return .
In some laghes in Alaska little laghes , the metane is already bolding on the water .
The professoresse Katey Walter of Alaska of Alaska team took a team bottom of a team , you know , the winner-winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow it 's good . The question is if we 're going to be .
One reason is that this termal exchange from the Greenland from the northermal .
This is a glacial river .
The ported he had never reach to get similar sons .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the west of the Greenland .
If you want to know how the level of the sea level of the ice , you know how to get the sea .
These corrups are increasing rapidly .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctarget of the planet .
The last month , the scientists have been switch that the ice of the ice is negative , and that Antarctargets , which is particularly free , which is particularly fastern on the slightly .
Eququital to six meters of the accounts like Greenland .
On Himalayas , the third biggest block , you see new laghi , which few years ago were glaciers .
40 percent of the world 's population will be population half the population of the world 's population .
Sull Ande : this glacier is the source of the powerful water of this city .
The ported is increased .
But when it decrease , the same happens to the powerful water .
In California the snow on the Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The idenced hyourself .
The predictions , as you read , are graves .
The growth of secure in the world 's increasing the remarkable increase .
The environmental disasters are increasing out of the normal and without precedental and without precedental .
Four times more number of times over the last 30 years respect to previous 75 .
This is a whole thing about all insustainable .
If you look at it in the historical consequences if they can see the consequences .
In the last five years we add 70 million tons of CO2 every 25 million tons of tons in the ocean every day .
Look attentially the Eastern Pacific , the American Eastern , towards west , and on both west parts of the subcontinent , where there is a radical oxygen in the oceans .
Most of the global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , which is the 20 percent of the use of fossil fuels .
Oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the most emissions , and China .
And he was proposed to build a lot of carbon .
But we 're seeing a change of direction .
These are the annonothing in the last few years and some high-alternative proposes .
Every way , there 's a political fight in our country .
The coal and oil industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year for the last year to promoting coal , which is a oxymold .
And that image was remembered something --
I 'm Natal Tennessee , where I live , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion gallons of carbon diocarbon .
Maybe you saw it on on the news .
This is the largest second largest flow of scories in America .
It happened around Natal .
The nature of one of the coal of the carbon industries was this .
Video : Exide , the carbon , it 's a happy , happy ,
It 's abundant here in America , and growing our economy .
Frosty the carbon is more and more public .
It 's good price , adorable , and the workers are keep the stay .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The largest minerary society is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Peloges , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Protection of Clima has launched two campaiged .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : ALergy see : CALergy see the climate change as a serious threat to our business .
So our priority is investing a great amount of money in a effort to a huge amount of money to make public and confused on coal .
In fact , coal is not sports .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good on a fire .
So not preokpateves of climate change .
Let 's do about it .
Video : Actor : Carbone you hear -- you 've heard a lot of you heard a lot .
So let 's let us do a turn in a structure about the health of the coal ,
Stranderful ! The machines are a little noise , but this is the sound of the carbon technology .
The carbon is between the main global causes of global warming , but the night technology of coal , but the night technology of the carbon that you see changes everything .
Let 's look at a look . This is the coal technology .
Al Gore : Indeed , the positive alternative connects to economic economic security and the national security .
Video : Lovous : America is in crisis ; the economy , national security , climate crisis .
The flows that the bottom of all : our dependence on fossil fuel , like coal and oil coal and oil .
Now , but , there 's a new , audace solution for used to use .
Repower America : 100 percent clean energy , in the 10 years .
One plan to reput America to work , make sure , make sure , and help us stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that you can solve our problems .
Repower America . Scover more .
Al Gore : That 's the last .
Video : Comvice : It 's rewards energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to bring the dependence on the dependence that killed our planet .
What 's the future is here . Vinent , only only , a new energy network .
What about the two : Noves investment for burning jobs for bad jobs .
Comvice : Repower America . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old African old African says , " If you want to go down to the fast , go down to the only .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We need to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED phecks a LHC .
And I promise to advance to the way the machine works .
So here I am . And for those that the other time there were no , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever -- 27 miles of circumference .
His task is to remember the conditions that were present less than a billion second , the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
This is just environment .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
We 're photography Big Big Bang in the retimers .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLALATLATLALATLALATLALATLALATLAS -- it 's like a 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLATLATLAS in building so you can see the proportions .
Ten September , we have acceserate the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLATLAS .
It was because of immense to festery in control .
It 's a picture of the first particles that had done everything the LHC , entering in collision , by collision , by a part of the LHC , and spread particles in the reator .
In other words , when we see that the 10 September the 10 September , we figure out the machine worked , which is a great victory .
I don 't know if that was this to make us exultent more or this , when somebody went on Google and saw that the initial page was this .
That means we have a cultural impact beyond that scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to these duses here -- these dored drugs .
These files are bring 13,000 amps when the machine works at the power of power .
Now , the technical among you will look at the flows and say , " It 's not true . They 're too sotal patterns . "
And they can do it because when they 're very cold becomes the superconditions .
So , less 271 degreds , at a temperature in the space between the stars , these files can bring that corrups can bring that corrups .
In one of the guntures in the LHC magnetic , there was a fabrical fan .
So the flows down slightly , and the 13,000 printing improvious improvious met .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think these magnets more than 20 tons , and that you have been moved of about 30 centimeters .
They 're slowed about 50 magnetic .
We had to take them , what we 've done .
We restined them and adusted and favored .
They 're all coming back to their place on the ground .
And then the end of the LHC will be again .
We 'll accensive , and we expect to get it to juggling data and continue so our adventure to find what the morning for the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents reaccess to science and engineering the science and engineering in science and engineering . It 's easy to confuture .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact of going on , the fact of the value of things like the LHC .
I 'd like to end with the words of a Inglaughter , Humphrey Davy Davy , which I think , in the injusts of the experiments of his public , he was Michael Faraday , he said , " Nient is a lot of the human mind of the human mind of the human mind as rehold to the science of the human mind , which is not in nature , which is that our trifice , and that 's not about the new worldwide , and that we have a totonist of our words of the world , and that we are not knowird is a returned out to be completes , and the world , and the world , and the world , and the world , which is the world , which is not the world , and the world , and the world , and the world , and the world , and the word of our words of
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink about when you 're , you 're going to ask , played with the morning .
As you understand how to get them and deal with it , get them and get them , and get them , learned to think and solving problems , and you know , actually , to think of problems and spatial relationships .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand the world around us .
So , from information , inspired by the uslness of our physical objects , and my consultant Patts , and my consultous Patts , and my collaborator Jeevevan Kalanithi , I started asking to ask me , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only curror of the digital polluter , we could deal with a dest information with both a dest information with both a dest ,
and sistemard-pleasure ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer interactive , like a cookay .
In a few words , a Siftable computer interactive , like a cookay .
You can move them with the hand , they can see them , they can see their movement and have a radio and a radio screen and a radio screen .
But most photos , they 're physical objects , you can just move just to simply sandols .
Siftable Siftable is a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate information .
And as it is more physical , the other way , the other , the other , and as the other , and as they become more physical conscious , of the other , of how we move , we can explore new and fun new styles of interaction .
I 'll start with a few simple example .
This Siften is configurated to show the video : if they including it in a direction , the video rrush like this , if you including on the other side back .
These interactive rats are aware of the other people .
If you look at them , you 're interested what they 're going to do .
If they 're surrounded , they notice it and they can get a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , they notice it and they can get a little bit .
They have their movement and inclination .
We realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power of the interaction was the power of data , for example , " to put " a color like a color like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurated as a secks and I can use them to try to do them in the middle color in that central , where they missing .
and I can use them to do color in that central color in that central , where they miss .
If we 're too too much , we can restop a little bit .
They are also beautiful possibilities to learn , like languages , math and logical logical and logical logical things where people can try and see the immediately results of the immediately .
Now , I 'm --
This is a Steam of Fibonacci I do with a equations .
We have a game of the words of half that is half between Scarabeo and Bogle .
Pratically , at every turn a letter on every turn to be in Siftable , Pratically , at every turn on a letter on every Siftable , and while you 're trying to buy words control on a direceive .
And then , after about 30 seconds , you get a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came in the gen at the Media Lab , I did it and I did a video video .
They were very much .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people many education .
You just say , " We need to say , " We can do it .
Here 's how other people who are trying to do it .
This is our younger head , right there .
It really wanted to impilate them .
They were only morning , for him .
Now , this is an interactive application of a cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for languages . And we wanted to build a languages .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Siften , they sold the Siften .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Siften , they sold the Siften .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The only surprient is .
David Merrill : Now he 's taken a track in the scene .
Video : The arange treator .
By work ! Yeah .
So I school , I school Siftable and put them close can interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
and by inventing their own story .
Video : Hear !
DM : It 's a story with the final open , and it can decide him how you get .
DM : It 's a story with the final open , and it can decide him how you get .
Video : Vola , cat .
DM : The last example I 've got the time to show you is a tool , realized , to walk and exective music , to walk and exective music .
It 's a tool , realized , to pay and willing music and exececectual music .
Siftable here , like the sound of basic , based and the bacteria .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also put these sound sound in a sequence to you can buy your feeling .
And they just further , doing a sound and a sequence .
These are effects that you can control from the vive , like the reverbs and the filter .
I 'm attacks to a particular sound and then they including it .
And then there are the general effects as time and fly , which you applicate to the whole sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : DM : We 'll start putting a base in two Siftable Siftable , we 're going to put it in a series , we add other base .
So I put a low line of low .
Video : DM : Now , I add some percussions --
Video : And I 'll put the battery to the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the alive .
DM : DM : DM : I can fly the whole sequence by one side or the other side .
Video : And I 'll add the filter to the low low low low floor more expression .
Video : DM : I can recombine the sequence " to fly . "
So I don 't have to plan it first , but I can improvising it , and it 's longer or more .
And now , finally , I can smoke the whole sequence and they inclinding the Siftable to the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new men interface new multiple machine and more like how our brain work .
And I 've had time to show you one of the results of this lost , and also some chance that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to turn you is that it 's coming this new generation of projects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world as we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the hour to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writer .
I 'm writing books is my profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and my life ,
And I don 't expect to change .
But , he said this , something particular happened in my life and my career , which took me to realibrate the entire recently report with this work .
The particular thing is I recently written this book , this biography called " Mangia , " which , diversity , diversity from my previous books , for some reason books , for some reason that world , and become a big , sensational , blind , and it became a very interational , inational seller .
And the result is that everywhere go , people treating me as if I was convicted .
It 's true -- convicted , convicted , convicted .
They 're going to be worried , and they say , " Don 't you fear more than doing it ?
You don 't get to write for all life without power to be able to create a book that can important to somebody to create a book that can care about somebody ? "
what does it care about somebody ?
It 's rassure , you know .
But it could go worse , part of the one I remember that over 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a adolescent adolescent -- I was a writer .
I went to meet the same reaction based on the same reaction .
And people say , " Don 't you have to succeed ?
Don 't you fear that the humiliation of killed you ?
You 're not fear to do this mestive for all life without that nothing is ever outside and die on a cumulation of a dream of infrants with the dinner of failure of failure ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah .
Yes , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also argue of many other things that people could not have to walk .
As the other way the others .
But , how about this is what I thought , and I was wondered , I was going to ask me is why ?
It 's rational ?
It 's logical that anybody who should expect to be spent by a job that you feel like to do .
But what is there is so particular in the creative impress to make nervous health of other people in a way that other people don 't do ?
As my father , for example , he was a cheeef engineer and I don 't remember a only in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he had fear to be engineer ?
It was never -- that block of the engineer John , how does it go ?
Don 't it worked like this , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals like group don 't certainly have no , in the secoli , the reputation of being alcoolied .
We have enough of writers , we have enough this reputation , and not only creative writers of any gender , we have this reputation of being enormous mentally stable mentally .
And I 'm not going to look at the sad of the deaths of the magnifices of creative magnificent , only in the 20th century , they died young and often for them .
And those who are not suicipate is suicipate seemed to be real disdisfaced by their texture .
Norman Mailer , before he died in the last interview said , " Every my book killed me a little more " . Every extraordinary death of his life .
But we don 't buy , when we feel that we feel that because we heard these things that we 've done in some way we completely interized that we 've done the notion that creativity and suffering the notion that creativity and art , at the end , end , will be during the ang .
And the question I want to take all of here today is : are you agree with this idea ?
It 's good about this thing -- because he looks like a distance to me , it 's not good for anything about this supposed .
I think it 's hath .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encourage our great creative minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start fire out at the headly knowledge of the supposed to be in my career .
That 's really -- you look at the time , they 're pretty young , I 've got about 40 years .
I 've got about four decades work in me .
And it 's very likely that whatever you write now will be judged by the world as the work that I went out of my last book .
I 'm slavery , because we 're all more or less friends here -- is likely that my greatest success is my shoulder .
Oh , Gesus , who thought .
You know this is the gender of thinking that brings that brings a person to start behind the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would like to keep doing this work that I love .
So , the question is , how do it ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflections , the way to work to keep writer is to create a psychological cougical cour , OK ?
I have to find a distance of security between me , which I 'm writing , which I 'm writing , and my natural reaction on which is going to get it . And as I was going to look through the last year , trying to find other societies to see if they could have the best of the world to see if they could have the best ideas and healthier ideas .
about how to help people creative creative people to manage the emotional risks of creativity .
And that research has taken me to the ancient Great Rome .
Seep me because I 'm going to circle back .
In the ancient Great Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit severe seared and that came to the men somebody from somebody who 's source and unknown , for the distant reasons , for distant and unknown .
The greek called these spirits of creativity of creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a demon the wisdom .
The Romans were the same idea , but they called that spirit without a genius .
That 's great , because Romans wouldn 't really think that a genius were particularly smart .
They had a genius was a genius of entities that created was literally lived in literally in the walls of a artist , a little bit like the Doby , and that came out of assistance , and that came out of assistance and in the artest of that work .
Exept -- here is the distance of which I talk about -- that 's the psychological disusual that you protect from the results of your work .
And they all knew that it was so that it worked , right ?
So the anti-who were protected by certain things , like , like , for example , too narcissism , right ?
If you work was exceptional , you couldn 't take it all the goods , all knew that you were helped by this genius .
If your failed work , it wasn 't it all your own , right ?
And they all knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people han conceived creativity in West for a long time .
And then Renascivvvent came and everything changed , and nacked this big idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe over the universe all the mysteries and no longer leaving space to the sectors that write by divinity .
This was the pripe of humans , rational and people started to think that creativity came out of the ights completely from ishared ishared .
And for the first time in history , you started to referred to this or that artist as a rather than a person in the genius .
And I have to say , I think it was a big mistake .
I think that allow somebody , a simple person to believe that you can be as a recipient as the source , the essence and the kind of the mysteries of all of the divines , inosis a purpose responsibility for the great psyches .
It 's how to ask somebody to put the sun .
Deform and distores completely the ego and creates all of these inextremendous expectations on performance .
And I think it was this to have been this to destroyed the artists in the past 500 years .
And if that 's true , and if that 's the question is , the question of it 's , and now ?
Can we do it fun ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of rational thinking in a talk of 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people between the audience that would sold to the scientific subspects on the notion of , you know , you know , you know , you do follow their projects .
I 'm probably not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I 'd like to take is -- why not ?
Why not think that way ?
Because it 's more sense of everything that you 've ever heard to explain the exasperformance of the creative process .
A process that , as anybody who ever ever loved to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- it 's knows , you know , you know , you know , you don 't realized .
And in fact , it can sometimes it looks completely paranormal .
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poetetetesh RutStone , who has now 90 years , but that was a poetesh for all life and told me that during his childhood in the rural childhood , and he felt it , he was working out in the rural childhood , and he felt it , in the poem .
He said he was like a fragorous air track .
And that was rotating to the landscape .
He was hearing , because he was doing it , because he was doing it , under his feet .
He knew you had one thing to do about that point and it was , his words , " It 's a matter . "
And so it goes to home and come back to this poem , and it would not have to make a piece of paper and a match enough of paper and a match and a match enough match , while the trapparts and sweep , and he would be on the page .
Sometimes you couldn 't be fastly , so it goes and then it goes and then they were going to get into home and the rotated her and he would keep it up through the landscape and she would continue to rotate through the landscape , and he said , " another poet . "
And then there were those times -- this piece of the time -- there were moments where it was almost lots of moments where it was almost losing , right ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to paper and the poem was going through , and he was going to a hyourself in the time , and then he said , " He was like saying , " He was like sleep with the other hand the step .
And he was going to the poem from the tail and reput it in his body and transpypage on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page and it 's like the last word at the first word at the first .
So when I felt it -- it 's a crazy , it 's exactly equal to my creative process .
I 'm not a creative thing -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a music , and my way to work is , you know , wake up at the same time and setting up and go on and go on on and go on on the bottom .
But even I , in my head , I 've strished against that thing , sometimes .
And I think that many of you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , a lot of you , many of you , and I think of you have a lot of you , many of you , and I think of you have a lot of you , and I think of you have a lot of you have .
You know , even if the job and ideas came to me from a certain source I could not honestly know , I could not lost .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it to do it , but , rather , rather , but , rather , rather , that does remains healthy ?
So , as I 'm as a best example , the best contemporary example I have is the Tom Waits , which I interviewed a different years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life has been the incarnation of the life of the artest artance of the life of the artest , trying to checking these species of creative totally internal creative .
But then I went , he got up , and he was driving on a day as he was driving on a autoroad in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going to faste and everything of a tract tract of this little melodia , which is coming in his head of inspiration , electric and cheery , and you want , you , you know , it 's wonderful , and desider , but not how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it 's not a match , it has no register .
So he starts to feel this kind of old anxiety growth in him like , " I 'm going to lose it , and I 'm going to song from this song .
I 'm not enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , they stop .
And he was going to do the entire mental process and he did something completely new .
I just look at the sky and said , " Don 't you see that I 'm driving ? "
" You know , " How do you know , " Do you know , " Do you know ?
If you really want to exist , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
Otherwise , you go to care about something today .
You see Leonard Cohen . "
And his process of working changed after this .
I don 't work , the work was still known as always .
But the process , and the fish that was that attornized it was required when the genius , the genius of him who was caused to do something else that problems and liberated it back to where it comes , and he remaining it back where it was , he was doing that he didn 't have to be an interized and tormented .
but I 'm going to do this peculiar , beautiful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange thing that allowed and external thing that was not Tom .
So how I feel that story started changing a little bit , the way I worked on and already me once .
This idea , I was writing , when I was writing " Mangie , Ama , " and fall in one of the cave of the disperation where we all cause when we 're working on something about something and we can 't start to think that it will be a disaster , which is going to be the worst books .
Not just bad , just just the worst book , "
And I started thinking about gone this project .
But then I remember Tom that I talked about air and I talked about air and tried us .
So you zoos my face in the lack and I realized my common corner of the room .
And I said to high voices , " What , " do you know , " Well , if this book is not going to be interaction , right ?
Because as I see , I 'm going to put it out of this .
So if you want to be better , you have to present and make your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I 'm not going to do .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I would like to do for the middle that I 've been presented to do my part of doing my part of the North Africa 's deserts in the deserts of North people were soul for the kid of the middance of the middance , and music and music that they were going to go forward for hours and high .
And they were always magnifices , because the ballerini were professionals and they were great .
But every while , it 's something happened , and one of these artists become transancendent .
And I know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've all seen a certain point , a performance like this .
It was like the time stopped , and the dance ballery , and he walked through a kind of spot , and he walked through a kind of dancing , but everything else is slowly slowly down .
And suddenly , it doesn 't appear as a human .
But you get accurate from the dierd and over the fire in the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , at the time , people knew what was called it with her name .
They kay their hands and started to cantar , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God , Allah , God . "
That 's God , you know .
It 's known stories -- when Ms invads the South of the South , I was this abitude with their own and pronounded changed in the seats from " Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , " " " " Os , " the rds , " which you can hear in the rray or the fends of the rush of the rate .
In Spain , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , " Allah , " the rds , Allah , magnificent , Allah , " eunderstandable , " ecraft God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But the problem is coming , the next day , for the dancerin the morning , and you discover that the 11 of the morning of Martedday 's morning of Martedday , and God 's not .
It 's just a mortal with a bad bad with ginoccurred , and maybe never to get to that height .
And maybe no one will be the name of God still while it 's going to do with his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful recognition to make a creative life .
But maybe it has to be so angot-force if you can 't believe , indeed , injumped , inturing the most extraordinary aspects of your being from you .
But you just believe that they 're just going to be prested by a source of this squisite part of your life that you have to get to somebody else when you 're finished .
And , you know , if we think about this is this way changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly like this , and it 's a lot of the workers that I was publish , I 'm publish , spent , spent , I was a spent , I was a following of my own success .
And what I have to continue to say when I feel elected by this is , not going to be wearing .
You don 't just go down . It 's just your work .
It 's about your part , any way , any way , any one is .
If your work is balling , bad .
If the divine , you list in the divine , you know , I 'd walk some kind of wonderful , for one moment through your effort , then , " On ! "
Otherwise , you do the same dance .
And " Ole ! " " You know , the same .
I think , I think you have to teach it .
" On you know , it 's just for having the same , for having loor of humans to make you continue to give you keep it continuously .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
You know , I talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what is going on and the discovery of new genes .
Now we 're starting a new fashion . We started to digitalize biology and now to start to the digital code we 're going to a new phase of biology , designing and synthetic life .
We 've always tried to bring big questions .
" What is life ? " is something that many biologists I think they 've tried to understand and vococtopus .
We tried different approaches , reducending it up , reducending it .
We 're digitalizing almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treating from the analogical world of the computer biology in the digital world .
Now let 's ask us : we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest genome who can autoreum in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to make one more smaller .
We 're able to eliminary a hundred genes of the 500 that are here .
But when you look at his map maps , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
Let me , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes we can eliminary , one at the time , it 's very unliving , that this can bring to a living cells .
So we decided that the only way the only way to progreenhing this chromosom to get to modify the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " Can we synthetize a cromosoma ? "
It can be able to produce these big molecules that we never have ever been able to create these big molecules that we 've ever been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can we make a cromosom ?
A cromosoma is just a piece of chemist of chemist .
The speed that we 're able to digitalize life is growing exponential rhythm .
Our capacity to write the genetic code , instead , procrete rather slowly , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results the branching on an exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process has require many pasages , starting with a bioetic review before we started the first experiments .
But we found that that synthesize DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of machines in DNA , the longer segments of 30 to 50 letters and it 's a degenerative process : the more segment is longer , the segment is longer , the more errors there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembly these fragments and rhor the errors .
And this was our first attempt , to start digital information from the Phi Igenome 174 .
It 's a little bit of the bacteria that kills .
We 've designed the fragments , effectively the repes of errors and get a molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemist material , and we put it into the bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and produce the viral particles .
The viral particles were required by the cells , they 're back back and destruct .
I 've talked about recently with the oil industry , oil industry saying that they have certainly compressed this model .
They have more than you .
We believe this is a situation where the software can really build his hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in big .
We wanted to build the entire cromosom .
They 're over 580 mies letters of genetic code .
So we thought we 've thought of building it in the size of the virus , so that we can change the casses for the living of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accurately mistake was a mile for every 10 miles .
We discovered , 30 , 30 , 30 , you know , 30 , you know , we 'd ever been used that original sequence we would never be able to do it work .
One part of the process is designing 50 letters that are overwhelming segments that are in 50 letters to build the smaller subunits , to build smaller subunits work together .
We 'll see elements here .
You know , you know , you know , which we put on the figliguring .
So , think it 's a genetic code based on four letters : A , G and God .
Three of the reading , they code about 20 lots of minoacids , and there 's a specific order to each minothers .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , fralmost , thoughts .
What we did was autograph to do .
Some of them were deluses from the fact that it wasn 't poetry .
We 've designed these segments to just just just just to join them .
There are enzymes that repair them and put them care .
And we started assembly assemble parts , beginning with seven miles from five to seven miles , unending a segments to make a segments of 24 mile letters to get to 72 thousand reading .
So we have these sequences in abundance , so that we 're trying to make them sequence , so that we 're trying to create a very robustood process -- you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems like the tabellon a basket .
When we get to these very long segments , over 100 mile , over 100 mies , they 're not going to grow more directly in the E. coli .
It 's coming to the molecular modern tools .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We knew mechanism mechanism called recombination , which in biology to repair the DNA can be able to repair the DNA can bring the segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodures , can absorbed three million rad rad of radiation .
You can see in the super requarter as the chromosom is destroysom .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly like it was before .
There 's thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
You can get these organisms are completely .
They can live under empty .
They 're absolutely certain that life exist in space , and you move to find new environments of water .
And in the real , NASA showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processes , simply using the lifestimated of the segments that they 're going to put .
The least lies the automatically assemble .
This image was not taken with an electronic microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It 's a great molecule that we can see it with a bunch of a light .
These are pictures that are cover about six seconds .
This is the publish we 've done a little time ago .
They 're over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined structure that man 's ever created by the man .
It has a weight to 300 million .
If we stop a carrier 10 without spaces , you 'll take 142 pages , it would just take 142 pages to transpores ,
Now , how do we do it work ?
Of course , you do a virus is a guys .
It 's a little more complicated when you use bacteria are using bacteria .
It 's easier when it 's ekarios as ekarote as our : You can just extract the nucleus and put another , which is basically the clonation .
In the bacterium archaea is integrated instead of integrated inside the cells , but we have recently demonstrated that we 're able to do a transplant transplant of a cell to another and activity .
We 've got a bunch of a microbial species .
The two are as different as humans from the men .
We add some gene in the more way that we could decide what to choose for this chromosoma .
And then the skiolden with the enzymes in a way that we kill all proteins .
And when we put it in the cells was study -- and you 're apprecies our sophisticatoos -- the new cell cell has gone .
And we were thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we 've tried to spinering it in the longer .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We discovered that a lot of species have added a third or a second or a third thousands of new tracks in a thousands of new tracts to that species .
So who think about evolution as only as a gene at evolution , you know , you know , the only one of the biology .
And there is enzymes called restription that they 're digm , they 're going to say , DNA .
The cromosom that was in the cellent cellular cellent doesn 't have one .
The cell phone that we put cell on the cell that we put it .
It 's expressed , and he recognized the other chromosom as an expressed material , and we were returned with only the cells and the new cell cell .
It has become became blue because of the genes we put .
And in a short lass of time , all the characteristics of a species have been going to be lost , and you have transformed in a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cells .
All the proteins are changed , membranes are changed , and when we read the equival genetic code what we 've been transfers on what we 've transfers .
Now , this could look at genetic , but we 're altering the software DNA , we can change things in a pretty fundamental enough .
Now , I 've been talking about genesis -- but progress that we have been talking about three and a half million years old evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian explosion .
Why do that ?
I think it 's obvious when we think about our needs .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right for example : I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 , 40 years , they will be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean and clean and gasoline billion people .
It 's going to be more tough to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , over 30 billion oil , over 30 billion oil baries .
That means millions of baries a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to reduce them , it will be a huge challenge .
We need to keep the whole emission of all the CO2 emission from these materials that ends in the atmosphere .
And in the day , because of scientific discoveries around the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are the components for the future .
The electronic industry only only has a dozen about a dozen components , and think about how many different things came out .
Our limits here is basically a biological reality of our imagination .
Now we have a techniques , thank you very quickly , because of the synthetization , able to create what we call combatory combatory .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million cromosomes a million cromosomes a day .
Think of this 20 million different genes or to try to get the processes and try to get the process of the processes to produce eight-drugs , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for chance to survive , chemistry or fuel , chemistry , ethetc .
This is an instantaneous instantaneous instantaneous instantaneous , to be able to seatch and design species to the computer .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how they will be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
Now we 're going to focus on the fourth generation .
You 've seen you that extrards from the grate was a bad experiment finished .
We have a lot of second and third generation that will be enough to be soon as much higher than the high value of the higher than either either than either the of-value types .
But the only way biology that biology can have a big impact without increases the cost of food and limitation is to transform the cost of food and limited the CO2 in matter before , so we 're working for the design that we 're working for for design cells that can get to get the first generation of this , and we think we can have the first coal of what you generation in about eight months .
The solar light sunlight with CO2 is a metodowntown -- but in our discovered all over the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism we described in 1996 .
It lives in the ocean , about 2500 meters of deep depths to the temperature of ebolliance .
They rea molecular way of the CO2 using molecular hydrogen energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can clear CO2 , which can easily be transported by the tubes , convert that CO2 in the fuel , to drive this process .
So , we think we can be able to increase what we can be able to increase what the basic asks of what life is " life " is Nice , vercompared the whole goal of replacing the whole obic goal .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And we 're working on to use the same metods to create instantaneous vaccines .
You see this year with the flu , we 're always back a year , and a dollar in less when it 's about find the vaccine is the fair .
I think that this can change building fighting and fighting .
Here 's how the future could start to look change , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating the synthetic bacteria , archy , and finally , and finally , and finally , and finally cellubrates eucariote .
We 're so on the best people .
Our purpose is to do enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'll show you , the quickly possible , some fundamental work , some fundamental work , the new technology that we 've taken to the Microsoft , in a year ago exactly . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment where you can interact is to local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
We 're seeing a lot of digital gabyte pictures with a kind of zoom and continuous queery , for a panoramic sponing , disponing the images like we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these are collected or the images of data or images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this is a scanning scanning from the Bioownership from the Congress , and relower in the gamma of 300 meggapixel .
It 's not a difference because the only thing that limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen on the screen in any time . It 's an architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not images .
This is the Dickens of Dickens . Every colonful colonful represents a chapter .
And to show you that it 's about text and not images , we can do something like that , to really make a real thing of this , to really make a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial to read a little electronic book .
You don 't recommend .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading the version of a revision or a quotidian , which is nature a lot of a half .
We also did something with the corner of this particular , in the Guardian .
We 've created a fasulous advertising -- much more than what you use in a normal publish , and we put in a normal advertising -- and we put you put on the extra content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see it here .
Or other other models , or even the techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminary limits of space on the screen .
We hope that that means to put up to the pop-up and other porcheries , and other symillions , not needed .
Of course , the mapplications is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if we don 't say that we have contributes to give up in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. geospspspatial of NASA .
So , we 're going to something else .
This is actually from the Web , you can go to the Web ; you can see it .
It 's a project called Photosyxnth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research an interesting research on computer very interesting , made by Noah Snavity , a student of Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Szeliski , the U.S. . " It 's a very good collaboration .
And it 's from Seb , gested by Seb ,
You can see that when we do this pattern , where we can get from one image to another and have this kind of experience , and have this kind of experience in the multiple resolution .
But the space space of the images here has actually actually actually a meaningful meaningful meaningful .
The algorithms of visualization computer-standed these images together , so that they correspond to the real place in real spaces that images -- all of these are spaces . And so , you see the Roccious Roccious Roccious Death , they were down . So , you know , you know , you know , you see elements of a switch standing , and these things have been connected to spaces .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more spatial .
I want to go directly to one of the original Noahh-- and this is from a previous prototype of Photosynnthrown to show you what the first time the extent scorseum to show you what the key is really the key behind this technology , the Photosynthic , and it 's not necessarily evident about the environments we 've put in the website that we 've put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstantly reconstantly Notre of Dame images from Flickr . Baast Dame in Flickr , and you get images in the magicions , other fies of the campus , other fies of the campus , other figure out of the wind of the arancions represents a image that is discovery that it 's discovered to this model .
So they 're all images from Flickr Flickr and they were all connected to this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this way simple .
You know , I would never think of the end to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying , you know , this kind of accocket here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different types of spring : from the phones to the professional SLR : the phones to the professional SLR , a number of meaningful , men together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try to look for those strange .
A lot of them are block , etc .
Some part here is a photographs -- here it 's a series of photographs -- here .
This is a poster of Notre Dame recorded correctly .
We can go from poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the college of the entire memory of how the land looks like the land , from visual visual -- and connect all of those data together together .
All of the picture become connected , the higher of the parts .
You have a model of the entire that emerges .
Think about this as a Stephen Lawler 's work on Earth virtual Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as people are using it , and the advantages for people who are using it for the use .
Their picture are sea path , they put in the other people .
If somebody is the idea of contraction , the nothing that 's called the Tewo , my photo Do improvisely , you know , my photos of all of the data , and I can use it as a point of injumped to this space , in that metaphor , in that metaphing the picture of cross-model , red social experience of cross-mobile red , cross-mobile red and red red ,
Of course , a consequence of this is virtual models of any interesting , every part of the earth , collected every part of the ground , and you know , but from the college memory , but from the collective memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software will be able to do is that you 're going to do is that at a point , in the next few years , all the photographs , all shared together ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is basically discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the basis in the content of images .
What 's really interesting if you think about the wealth of semantic information that many of the semantic information that many of these images are .
As when you get a research on the Web , you 're digite a sentence and the text on the websentence has a lot of information about the images of the picture .
Now , what if that pictures you connect to all your pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection and the quantity of wealth that is really huge . It 's a classic classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible .
BAA : So , thank you very much .
One of the major pleass when you travel and one of the delights of the etnographic research is the living between who has no anti-traditions , between the wind , the living in the wind stones , the gate in the wind stones , he 's driving the plants of the floor .
Basti think Jaguar travel even beyond the Via Lattea , or that the elders of the Inuit still are meaningful , or that in Himalayas , which in Himalayas , the budddmist of Dharma , to remember the importance of the Dharma importance of the Dharma , and that the idea that the world that we live in absolute , but it 's just a model ,
the consequence of a particular set of adaptations that our own own own own own own own own stands , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all sharing essential tracts .
We all hired . We 're all going to do .
We 're subjects to be retremendous .
We need to deal with inesorability of death , so we don 't surprisingly and ballies --
We all have art .
What it 's the particular song , the phone of the song , the dance of every culture .
It 's not that they are the Penan " Borneo 's the Borneo , or the follows of Haiti , or the following Kenya , or the desert Kenya , the Curland of the Ande , or a cameras in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak , or a yak allows of the Qomolangerma , on Everest , the mother of the world .
All of these populations teachers that there are some other ways of exists of thinking , other ways of model in the world .
And if you reflect a second , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
And then , the miric world 's cultures of the world creating a spiritual life and cultures that has volved the planet and is important for the planet as the planet as the as the ragnatogical ragela note note as a biosphere .
And you can think about this ragnature as a cultural ethnosphery and you can defining the sum of the sum of the concepts , dreams , dees , inspiration , ideas , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions bring into the human consciousness .
The etnosphere is the patrimonium of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we 're and what we can be as a species .
And because the biosphere was just just just consumed as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as a as a very quickly as much as quickly as it was successful as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as as a as a faster as a as a very quickly as as a very
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species has been on the hort of the simply extinction because it 's false , or -- in the most apocalyphical diversity -- and you don 't even even even close to the most optimistic diversity -- that of cultural diversity .
The index of this is , of course , the linguistic loss .
When you 're born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the sprain of human spirit .
It 's the middle of every culture is coming in material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a spiritual , a spiritual chance .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we 're sitting here in Monterey , at least half the children 's ethens .
They don 't teacher to children , which means , unless you know , unless you wouldn 't figure out something , which is already dead .
What 's more sad about being the silent , the last several , the latest to talk a language , the lander of the landwisdom of the things ?
This is a faired of somewhere in the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , every two weeks of a old old old old old old old old old old ancient language .
And I know somebody to say , " Isn 't it better ?
The world would not be a better place if we 're going to leave all the same language ? " Well , we all talk about yorba . We talk cantonese .
We talk kogs .
You 'll find a tract thing that means you can 't talk about language .
I 'd like to do a journey through the journey --
a little journey in ethnosh to give you a hide of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of exists , " I mean , " really different ways of exists .
Let 's take for example this Barasana Barasana , in Amazon , the popular anaconia , who crees to the myth of the west river of the west race of the waste of snap .
It 's a popular that is not able to distinguish the blue , because it 's the green because it 's identified in the time of the forest , which depends the popular popular .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial rules , called " language " : you have to marriage a person who talk about different language .
All of this radical in the past , yet the particular families that are in these extended families that are talking about six or seven languages that are about seven , no one of the languages .
They 're just going to listen to listen to it .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I 've lived , the Waorani Waorani Eastern Eastern , a incredible populous populous popular that has the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have taken a comfortable contact .
They did come down from the photographs that were were in a few who were very few who were in a population , forest that this popular population of the pluvial forest .
They collected the picture of the land , they turned to the research of a shape and , not find nothing , they have concluded that they were treated that they were treated that the five of the diavel , and they killed the five missionaries with the lance .
But the Worani were not only killed the straneiests .
They killed between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by the same .
We 're eight generations and we found two of natural death and we found two natural death and when we insist to know , they have loved that one of them were invited so that he was indeed with , and then they killed it . And then they kill it the same .
The cters were able to recognize the 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the first ' 80s , I was assigned a very interesting task when my professor of Harvard asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti me if I wanted to go to Haiti in the first Duvalier and the Twon Macoues , and impossessed me of the Duvaliered I used to do the zombie zombie .
So to give myracological sense , I should have to understand the Vodoun culture and that Vodoun and the Vodoo is not magnerent .
It 's pretty a complex metaphysical complex of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to say the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianthesietic , Islam , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always let out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious feeding . And instead of doing the Vodoo religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of slavery in the tragic tragic concept of slavery .
What 's interesting about the voodoo is the intense report between life and death .
So , you know , the lifts of the spirits .
The spirits can be invited by the Great Acqua , they respond to dance the dance of dance and replaced temporary the soul of the vive is the following goes the follows of the follows is the follows .
So , the voodooists say , " You know , God 's like God .
We 're saying in the temple and divention the time and divention . "
And from the time you 're going to be , is the spirit that you 're going to driving you , how can you do the bad you ?
So you 're seeing these incredible events : following voodoo in state of trance that touches impunes of the power of mind of the mind of the power of the mind when it 's cataled in a state of extreme of extreme , when it 's cataled in an extreme extreme .
And in all the popular that I 've lived the most extraordinary of Sierra Nevada de Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta , in Colombia section .
Educk of the ancivilization , and they live on the planning of Colombic planning in the Colombia in the attention of the conquery , population was on the vulcanic massive planning .
In a macy continent mackrouted , this popular never been conquered by the spagnology .
At yet they are governed by a cler-odd , but their training is very extraordinary .
The young people are taken away from the family three or four years , and they live secreged in a world made of good and homs and homs in the ice of the ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years choices to reproduce the nine months of the gestation that spend in the user of the mother of the Great Mother .
So , so , so , they get accultured to the values of their societies , values that predict their predict and only their predict , they keep the cosmic balance -- or to say the best ecological balance .
At the termine of this incredible began , they 're improvivisually taken out and for the first time in life , at the age of 18 , they see a holds of the first short , when the sun backyes , when the sun backyes , everything they learned in theory , everything they learned theory beautiful beautiful landscape . The prete behind does a past . The pret does a past . The pret does a past holds , he does a past back and say ,
" Yeah , how I said ,
It 's amazing . It 's about you protect it . "
It 's called the greatest brothers and they say we , we 're brothers , we 're the holds of the world .
This is intuition is extremely important .
When we think about indeed populations and the environment , we 're Rousness and the old story of the noble wildness , which is a razy concept in his simplicity or perhaps we 're invote and say that these populations are closest closest to the Earth of us .
The Ingenes are not feelings or not feel undebull .
There 's no space for these things in the disease of malaria Astopped Tibet , but for the time and the rhs of the Tibet , but in the rhythics of the Earth based on the concept of being known , but on an unknowledge of the Earth can only live closed , but a very well , the concept that the Earth can only live accounterness .
What does it mean ?
That 's a boy of the Ande Ande that grows credating that the mountain is a spirit of Apu who will drive his destiny will be a human beings , and it will be a different report , and it will be a different report , and it 's going to be a fun of the Montana , and it 's a male of Montana who grows up that a men of the Montana 's going to be screen .
That 's the death of a mineral or a mineral craft is irrifying .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the report between the individual and natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Britannica Britannica creding that forests served to be cut .
That 's made me a human being at different from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that forests are the forests of Hukuk and the paradise of the paradise and the paradise of the paradise and the spirits that live in the world , spirits that live in the world , spirits in the beginning .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different , you can start to understand some their sensitive sensitive to be able to understand some their sensitive sensitive .
I 've taken this picture to open in the nordocted Amazon .
Mayahuashuashuashuasks , the most powerful psychoacaasks .
What makes the longer does the plahuashuge labs is the physical potential , but his elements . It 's composed to two elements .
From a lside , this lexide that contains a hand , harmine and harm-moles , slightly hallucinogens .
You can just take the only plant , you have a blue smoke that alters a little consciousness , but it 's miscale , but it 's miscreen with the leaf of the Psychotria spoken of the Psychotria slide of the Psychoth said .
This plant contains striple , very similar to the seroonin the midd-the-five , methoxypamine-thoxyplyplypamines .
If you ever see Yanomami , you know , you know , the nse that they make a different set of species , anchy , which is contains methoxypamine .
As it 's a little bit like the nose is like being disappeared by a fire of a bunch of wind woods and landing on a sea of electricity . It 's not creates the stortion of reality .
I often my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who waiting the man who waiting the was psychedelic , with his discovery of the Mexico .
I mean , my thesis , you can 't get these tripamines like hallucinogens because if you can 't tell any one of being hallucined . And they can 't tell you that . But you can 't tell you very horical inhurrented by a enzyme , because they are money from a naturally enjoyed by a enzyme that you are naturally in the intestine , detectured .
It 's possible to absolutely , if you can just get to other chemicals that money , MAO .
Now it 's the beautiful : the beautiful beautiful dioxide , the same kind of MAO , the same kind of need to be able to be able to be the tripsts . The question is in a free spontaneous spontaneous source : in a free free free , but if you combine in this way , create a version of biochemic version that is summmmmmmmma is summmmmma on ?
We use the great euge euging of error , which can be infruttify .
But if you ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " The plants are talking . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuge , which are nected in the forest , and that our eyes would be in the same species .
If we ask them how they are going to be , they 'll say , " I thought , " I thought of the rains , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , " No . "
The solution is : you take the 17 varieties in a night of a while , and each night with a little bit of a different .
With this is not a fluid to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that contt stami to contt stami stams .
Now , [ [ the problem is that 's also the problem that even have the ingenes that are puts in the ingenes are painting , but in some reducts , in a reducts of the story of the real world , and pass beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it 's not reminds for his wars or its innovations , but rather as the era that we were stopped and we used activity or accepted destruction of the biological diversity of biological diversity of biological diversity of the planet .
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new lifests .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux don 't stopped to be Sioux when they put out of the Americans and free and falled as well as Americans have been wallowed by horse and hot .
It 's not the change or technology that , which is the integrity of ethnosfic . It 's the power .
The during the domination .
And if you look at the world , you 'll find that these are not cultures that these are not cultures of these are not cultures .
They are living creatures and dynamics spints out of identifable existence that are beyond their ability to adaptation .
Which is that you 're disboxes in the Penan ,
a popular nomake of Sarak , in the Sarak , the asian popular who lived on the forest to a generation , and now reduced to the service and the prostitution on the record of the rives of reflection , where you can see the floor of the rive reflection that looks like the MCinese MyCinese Merian , where the naves of the naves ,
ready to refun the living woownership with the wood forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are come with the gold .
If we move on on the Tibet , where I 'm doing many research that you 'll see the hard of political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physical extinction of a popular , is convicted to universal level , but ethnocide , the destruction of the lifestyle of life , not only is condition , but it 's a remarkable celebrated , but it 's part of the strategy of development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet , until you 're not part of the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in China in China , in China through the Southeastern Tibet , coming to Lhasa with a young lines , but only came to Lhasa , I figured out what behind behind the statistics we feel about .
6,000 sacred sacred to polly-handed and fall .
1.2 million people killed by military military during the Cultural Revolution .
The dad of this guy was ascritical to the Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to the time of Chinese Indian Chinese invasion .
It 's floor fleap in Santity , during the diaspora who 's popular Nepal .
Her mother was impresoned and his colputs was rich .
It was taken of black in the age of two , I hired two years old hidden under his gonna because it could not live without him .
The sister , who did the same , was mesh in reeducation .
One day he wears a day shephass a coffering in Mao and , for this transgression , was mesh works for seven years .
The Tibet can be insopurable , but the reputting of the popular popular is .
And then , it 's all about a choice .
We want to live in the world monoromatic of the monothic world or want to across the poloowners ?
The big anthropologa Margaret Mead , before he died said his greatest fear was that , in our going to go towards this love of the world , not only will see the entire gamma of human imagination , we 'll think , but one day we 'll see from a saving of a sonnote mode , and even even even that there were other possibilities .
And it 's umiliating the species of our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Neolithic Right , who gave us the agriculture , which did fight us to the seed cult of the seed of the seed of the holding spoetry of the herarchy of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has been 300 years .
That shapes that is not to be suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we 'll have to deal in the millennia .
When you get these miriades of the world is asked what it means to be human , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all risky the chance to be what we 're : a conscious , which has to make all the people and all the gardens can make all flows . And there are great moments of optimism .
I 've taken this photo the northern extremity of Baffin , when I went to the hunt of the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , he tells me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The government canadly has been not always gentle with the Inuit and in the ' 50s to stay our softs , we 've require them .
The grandfather of this man refuted to go .
The family , teaching his life , took him all his own reards , and all his reef .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't themselves the cold , frankly ,
The bad of the slexes in origin were made of cartoon .
The grandfather 's intimise , you didn 't put by the artics or the library that suffering .
It 's gathered off , you have hot the pantalone , the focused in the skin and defected in the own hand . When I did the flip , they worked by making a lama .
It 's spring on the door of this clue , and when they became solid , he killed a dog .
He swimmed the dog and created a brid , with the actic cash , he 's got a sleth-shared , and it 's disappeared on the bankners , you know , a ballows on the reast .
We want to talk about cavarsely with nothing ? [ Rism ] and that , in different ways , [ Apausi ] is the symbl of the Inuit and all the popular popular popular ] and all the world 's popular .
In the 1999 , the U.S. government canader redded the total control of a greatest area of the greatest California and the Texas together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's an independent territory . They 're all the minerary resources .
One splendisplay of how a nation-state can reciliving with his popular .
And , finally , I think it 's pretty obvious about who of us was in these remote zones of the planet , remote that they remote that they are not remote .
For somebody is .
They represent sections of the human imagination that are treating at the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , like dreams of our children , become part of the geography of our children , become part of the hope .
For finally , we have National Geographic we convinced that political political areas will be never to get to nothing .
We believe polemiics --
[ Applauses are not persual , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the world , maybe we 're the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month 35 million lives .
156 Paese , they transmitted our television .
Our laughs from millions of people .
Our work is travel in ethnospheral to bring our audience in places of wonders that they will go away from the way , they can get out of how they saw it out of how they saw it , you will be able to get the central reveation of the exists of the exists of the exists of the world , and multicultural life in a world .
where the wisdom of all the popular wisdom .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some of the things I wrote in this book that I hope you 've heard other than you 've heard and I 'm going to try to evidence some connections .
I 'd like to start with what I call " the dogma officer . "
The dogma offical thing ?
The dogma offical dogma 's dogma , the dogma offical dogma recently , " If we want to massive the well-being of our citizens . "
The reason is , from a side , in the fact that freedom is in itself a value , is precious , useful , essential for humans .
And the other is that if we 're free , each of us can act for their connection to do everything that massive thoughts our well-being , without any decided in our well-being , no one that decided to name .
The way to massive freedom is massive freedom .
More choices , the more people are free , and more is their liberty , the major freedom is their well-being .
This , I think , it 's so deeply radicated in society that nobody would have to put it in doubt .
And it 's also deeply radical in our lives .
I 'll show you some examples of what progress you can .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I 'm just going to give me a simple note about conditions .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without content 10 variety of oil and the 12 acetables of oive oil and 12 acetages that nobody of the 175 acesage of the 175 of your degree , which no one of the 175 of your degree .
Here is what supermarket .
And then you go to the electronic store to buy a store . CDs , letter , radio , radio , radio , piathemselves , radio , piece , prints .
And in this single electronic negotie , there 's a great number of audio components .
We can do six and a half million different combinations using the components that there are only in one store .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Other tray : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the phone phone services , and they were provide mamma , and they were provide mamma Bell .
It was doing the phone , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , between the phone was that the phone has never rocket .
These days are gone .
We have a variety of the phones , especially in the phones .
Here 's the phones of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cut of the nose , and the holds to the burn to the burn .
If you don 't see that in the store under the negotie , you 're going to get .
And what happens is that people enters in the stoes and does this question . And you know what the answer is ? The answer is No .
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important of the purpose , is the same explosion of choices .
Assistence healthithanitary : It 's not happening in the United States you walk from the doctor and the doctor , what you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do A , or B , you can do . As these benefits these risks . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Doctor , what would I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , and B has these benefits . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebad , " Doctor if she was me , what would do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not she . "
The result of the result of the maled , expression that makes it look like a great thing .
But it 's actually not that a move the weight and responsibility to make decisions from somebody knows that you know , you know , you know , to somebody else -- and almost of course is sick -- and so not in the ideal condition to make that the patient .
There 's a huge marketing of drug products , direct people like me and you , that if you think about it has no sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why are they publishing them ?
The answer is that they want to doctor , we call the doctor to ask them to change .
Something that fundamental as is our identity is a question of choice , how you see in this vivital , " We don 't want to force children . They don 't want to hold their children . We don 't want to hold their sex an identity : We have to invent identity .
And we can reinventing how many times you do .
That means that every morning , at the morning , you have to decide that kind of person wants to be .
I 'm going to look at family and matrimonium , a time perspective communal , almost for anybody , was that he was that you marriage the most possible possible possible , and he was beginning to make the most possible possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not when , and not even that what to do after .
And it 's really to play .
I teach very smart students , and I 'm 20 percent of work , under I work with a time .
And not because they 're less brilligent , because they 're not because they 're diligent .
but why are they impensierites , I mean , " Would I wish or not I would have to get to do it now ? "
" I should be later ? I have to think about the children or the career ? "
They 're logorant interrogorange .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this implies , not completely to get the tasks and not get a beautiful vote to my own extremely .
And they really have to do it . They are very important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl underlucky , because it allows us to work every day , every single day , every corner of the planet , and every corner of the planet , transpent that the Hotel Randolphion .
It 's a parently , there 's a corner , and I 'll not tell you that , where the WiFi works .
I don 't say , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about the work ? It 's continuously decide , if we need to decide , and if we need to work or not .
We can go to see our son and look at the board , with the cell phone , the Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the notebook , on the ginnearly .
And even though they 're all spent , every minute that we see our child 's our baby , we 're also asking it , " I have to answer to this call this " ? "
" I have to say that email ? I have to get this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , this makes the experience of your child 's game very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the little , and big things , and big materials , materials and lifestyle , life is a question of choices .
On the world was this : Obuts , there were some chance , but it 's not a question of choice .
The world of today looks like this : The dilemma is , " Is it a slide thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Sholds .
The positive lesses we all know them , so I 'm going to talk about the negative ones .
All this choice is two negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxally , is that produces paralsis that instead of liberation .
With the many options of which choose choose to choose , it becomes very hard to do it .
I 'm going to give you an example : a study study conduct on flies .
A colleagues had access to the Vanologigantic data , the gigantic societies of about a million clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the lower of two percent .
With 50 funding funding on the way , there 's 10 percent of adesions respect when they are available only five . Why ?
Because with 50 funds of the flows , is maledly difficult to decide , and choice is remains the choice .
And then I 'm going to ask , questions , questions , questions , of course , questions , and of course , questions never get .
You know that means that these workers are going to mangering food for canoes because they 're not going to have enough money , it means that the decision is that lose the decision is that lose the funding of the complementary complementary the dator of the work .
Don 't they 're losing , they 're losing to five dollars a thousand dollars for the year , which would be well disposed to be .
So the paralysis a consequence of the tropps .
And I think it makes the world like this .
" And finish , " ethernity : ketchup , honesh , or maionese ? "
You want to take the right decision , if it 's for the right , if it 's for ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong bottom , and you can 't be the wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoid the paralysis , and we 're going to do a choice , finally less options from the result of how we would choice .
And that 's for different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions that you have to choose , if you buy a lot of them , and it 's not perfect , you guess that you could do a different choice that would be better . And what happens is better . And what happens is that the alternative images us industry of choice , and the replaced the squeery of choice ,
And when it was a very good decision .
More choices are , the easier , the easier is easy dispioneer-insod-insod-in-fest option of choice .
And there is what economists call constood is constood .
Dan Gilbert asked a lot of stammed as the value we 're going to things about things that we are the value .
In the rest , when there are many options , it 's easy to represent the characteristics of the scared alternative , and be less slightly of the option that you have choice .
Here is an example . I school with all of the New York .
But that 's what you probably think .
There 's this bad with the Hamptons .
A place of luses .
Samaden . Ottim . It 's all about them . It 's all for them .
Nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , that 's August . "
" All my neighbors at Manhattan is away . "
" I could talk about front of home . "
And it 's two weeks , from the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the chance of parking -- every day -- the chance of parking .
The constood is decrease the satisfation for what we have , even when choice was excellent .
And the more options that we have to look at , the more the exists attractive , the more expensive opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This vision tells us a lot of things .
It 's about living the moment , and maybe living slowly .
But the most important point is that any thing you choose , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
The things that we don 't choose to attract active that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : Expury growth of expectations .
I tried it on my skin beating a new couple of jeans .
I 'm just going to jeans .
And once the jeans were only like , they buy them and bestivestivestivestivestivestivestivestive , only after you 'd get them to go well .
So , I went to buy a new when the old old old old were , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
And he said , " You want to do fit , fit , easfit , connected to fit ? "
Do you want to be with the certainly or the bottons ? "
" Do you want to be strapted ? "
" You get them to large them , a blah ? Be blah . " Be blah .
I was slaughter , and after a little bit , I was able to say , " I want the guy that was the only kind of , " He was the only kind of , for a hour jeans , then I went out , I went out , I went out , I 'd come out of the jeans that I 've ever had .
It was the massive . And I had the whole choice , I had got the best .
But I felt like it .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to figure that .
The reason I was worse that I was worse with all that choice , the jeans had to be perfectative , jeans had to be perfect .
I was expectations , I was wait . I didn 't expect anything excited when it was only a kind of like , but when it was living 100 different , , at least one of a lot of like to be perfect .
What I was burning was good , but not perfect .
After I had compared that choice with what I was trying to do , I was insatisfied in compared .
The add of options in life does not increase the expectations that these have respect to the excellence of the options of the same .
And this will produce less satisfation , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world marketing if you realized it .
Because if they knew , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more about this .
" It was better when you were worse , " The reason you 'd better when he was worse , it was worse when he was worse he was worse , you can meet the surprisently .
And the world we live in the world that we live -- opulents , industrialized citizens with the expection of perfeature -- the massive thing that we can hope is that things are at the height .
You never surprisently , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you 're ingigantic .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse expectations " Yes , you want it . "
I mean , small autobiographical moment -- which I 'm really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't have done better , I couldn 't have a recognized .
But that 's not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of the jeans , and you know , when there 's only that jeans of jeans is that when you 're not satisfied , and you say , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " You know , the answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a jeans , and you buy who is responsible , it 's the responsible , it 's just as a clear that responsible is you .
You should have do better .
With hundreds of available variety , there 's no further .
So when people take decisions , even if the results is walking , they feel insed and they give the colcolate to them .
In the last few years , the depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this depression is just that people have deludate experiences because people have deludent experiences because the standards are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that colcolors are .
So the final result is that we 're better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me reminds you .
This is the dogma officer , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than haven 't at it , but it 's not going to sell that it 's better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magical . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been playing that we 've played by a piece of the level where choices are improved .
Now , from the political point of view -- I 've almost finished -- from political point of view , the political noct .
What 's allows all this choice in industrial societies is the material .
There are many places in the world , and you know about it , where the problem is not they have too choice .
The problem is that they have too a little bit too .
So the faces of the modern I 'm talking about is a while modern existed , the Western societies .
And what it does to have to be like , and the one is this : Steve Levitt talked about how those expensive and discovered you to be inuseful . It 's a money . It 's a spreef .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendious , it 's not just that they 're just useful .
I 'm even deleterie .
They get worse .
If a little bit of what in our societies allows were reversed in those where people too few possibilities , it would be not only their life to improve , it would be improve , but our our life .
That 's what economists call a pareting improvement .
A redistribution of the refined refined , not only to the poor -- because of this choice in excess that it comes back .
So , to end , " Let , you can become everything you want , "
You know , people of culture , you think , " What does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get it in a glass . "
" A imagination , a limited view of the world --
and I 've interpret this , at the beginning .
But then , think , I realized that that fish the long-gone of the knows that the long-gone .
Because the reality of fact is that if you send to the boat the boat , so that " all you can 't get the freedom . You get it . You get the paralysis .
If you break the boat in a way that everything can diminulives .
You get to the paralysis , and you 'll reduct the well-being .
They need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too , maybe even for fish , even for fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some symbolic sphere is a recipe for infection and , for roina .
Thank you very much .
