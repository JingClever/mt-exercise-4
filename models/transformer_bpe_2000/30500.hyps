I showed this year I showed these slides to demonstrate that the glacial calculation , which for almost three million years had the size of the 48 States , is record of the 48 percent .
But this undergravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice .
The artical calots is , in a sense , the heart of the global climate system .
You can winter down and you reach .
The next slide is going to be a fast-in-year-old , the last 25 years .
The ice lots of gathered in red .
You can see , you can see , they 'll expand the wall .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is inverners .
You can see that the ice cosidgn , along , five years or more , is like the blood , which is like blood , that here from the body .
In 25 years , it 's been so , in 25 years ,
This is a problem because the interest warming the ice land around the ocean on the ocean where there are huge amount of coal congeled that , slightly , saying , they 're transformed in meter .
I respect to the totality of the atmosphering global warming , that amount could double , superfort this point of not .
In some deeper side in Alaska little deep in Alaska metane is already reboling from the water .
The Katey Walter Walter of Alaska of Alaska was recented with a team caught on a bottom of the University of Alaska , the winter property .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wake good . The question is , if we 're going to be .
A reason is that this thermal exchange from the Greenland from the northers .
This is a glacial river .
The ported her never reached levels .
This is the Kangerlusaq , in the West Souast Greenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea level of ice , the sea stand-up , here is where it reaching the sea .
These corrents are going to grow rapidly .
On the other side of the planet : Antarttttarget of the planet .
The month went down to the scientists have districts in the negative , and that Antarctica , and the Antarctica , which is a poor in some islands , which is particularly in the sea , particularly in the several islands .
Exial to six meters of the floor in Greenland .
On Himalaya , the third biggest blob block , and they see new laghi , which few years ago were glacier .
40 percent of the world 's population will be able to be able to the bottom of the water from the wake .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water source of this city .
The ported the downstroyed .
But when you decreases , the same happens to the water .
In California the snow on the Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The backbye is in cribs .
The predictions , like you read , they 're graves .
The growth of the world leads to a remarkable increasing in the field .
The environmental disasters are going to a return out of the normal and precedented .
Four times more numerous than the precedented 75 years ,
This is a whole thing that 's a sustainable likely .
If you look at it in the historical consequences .
In the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of tons of CO2 every 25 million tons of tons in the ocean every day .
Look attently the East area of Pacific , the American area , to the west , and on both wns , and on both the sides of the Indian oxygen in the ocean .
The biggest cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuel .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions , together at China .
And he was proposed to build many other central mix coal .
But we 're seeing to a change of direction .
These are the annoullished projects in the last few years and some of alternative proposes .
Everything , there 's a politics in our country .
The coal and oil and oil industry have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting coal , which is a likely .
And the image of this image --
Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion gloss of carbon dios .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second largest scories of the big scories in America .
It happened around the Natal .
The nature of one of the coal of the coal industries was this .
Video : â™« Frosty , the carbon , is a piece of alleger and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's going to grow our economy .
Frosty the carbon is and more and more published .
It 's a good price , adorable , and the workers are keeping the bowl .
Al Gore : It 's here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest minerary societies on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his amministrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'm going to be -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Rid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Proteition of Clima has launched two campaiged .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Acore : ALergy see the climate change as a threat our business .
So , our priority is to investing a big amount of money in a public public force to make public and confused to the coal .
In fact , coal is not spored .
We think it 's clean , it 's also good .
So not preoken to climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Atbone : Carbone -- you heard about it .
So let 's let 's take a turn in a structure at the pattern for how much of coal published .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noious , but this is the sound of the clean technology .
coal consumer is between the main the main global warming , but the night technology of coal warming , but the night that you see changes .
Date a look . This is the clean technology of the clean technology .
Al Gore : In the end of the native security is connects to the economic issue and the national security .
Video : Comvalent : America is in the crisis , the national security , the climate crisis .
The flower that that the whole thing is : our dependence on fossil fuel , like cooil and oil , oil , the coal and oil .
Now , there 's a new car , a new car solution for used to use it .
Repower America : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A floor to reput America to work , make sure , and make us more sure , and help us stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that you would have to solve our problems .
Repower America . You cover more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's about re-energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to get to the dependence on the combustible combustible that they killing our planet .
What it 's the future is here . Vine , sole , a new energy network .
What it 's two : Noves investment for a good job retribute .
Comfi: Repower America . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old slide proverbio African says , " If you want to go fast , go to the fast .
If you want to go away , go together . "
We need to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
The year at TED , I did a TED introduction .
And I promise to figure back to how the machine works .
So here I am . And that the other time , there were not , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever taken -- 27 miles of circumference .
His task is to rererererequire the conditions that were less than a billion in the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
All of this is just environments .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
We took these mini-Bang Big in the relationship .
This is what I work . This is called ATLATLATLAS -- is 44 feet . It 's a 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLATLATLAs building , you can see the proportions .
Ten September last year we have access the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was cause of huge to control in the control .
It 's an image of the first particles that had done all the LHC , entering in collision , by the collision of LHC , and spread particles in the LHC , and spread particles in the redent .
In other words , when we see that image 10 , the September , we understand that the machine worked , which is a big victory .
I don 't know if this was this to do you get more or this , when someone went on Google and saw that the beginning was this .
That means we have a cultural impact on the other than the scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to these dorry sleeping here -- these dored dorate .
These flows to 13,000 amps when the maximum works at the massive works .
Now , the technicians between you look at the kids and say , " It 's not true . I 'm too sound . "
And they can do that because when they 're very cold dames become the supercondition .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a inferior to the inferior to the space between the stars , these floor .
In one of the guns between the most novemiles in the LHC , there was a defect of fabrication .
So the floor of leather , and the 13,000 printing suddenly encounter an electricity .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnets more than 20 tons , and that you have been moved of about 30 centimeters .
They have damaged about 50 magnetic .
We had to take them , what we 've done .
We repristined them and favuates .
Now , they 're going back to their place to their place .
And the end of the LHC will be again .
We 'll accening it , and we waiting this , and we 're going to go to right or lights , and we continue our adventure to find out what the morning .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents reacting the debate on the value of science and engineering in frontier .
I think that it 's so hard to go beyond the limitations , I think it 's the value of things like the LHC .
I 'd like to end with the words of a Inglaughter scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I imagine in defense experiments of his puppiler , the Michael Faraday , said , " Nient is a lot of humans as the mind of human mind as the mind of human mind as the way to be definitive human mind as the sunthat are definitive , and that there are not in the way that the trifloor , and that 's new sonists are not a totally . "
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink when kids , from kids , playing with the morning .
And as you realize them and slaughter and they 're going to get them and moving them , learning to think of solving problems and problems in the caping and manipulating space relationships .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand the world around us .
So , from information , inspired by the useful ininteraction with physical objects , and my consulting Patts , and my consulting Patts , and I started to ask me , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only cursor of the mouse crails that moves on a wild of the digital crawling , we could dealing a physically fashioned information with the hands ,
and sistemulate our further ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a big interactive computer like a cookie .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a big interactive computer like a cookie .
You can move them with hand , they can see them , they can see , they feel their movement and they have a screen and a radio pattern .
But most of them , they 're physical objects , like the morning , you can just move it .
The Siftable is a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physical , conscious , the other , and the other , and as they become more physicists , conscious , of the other , of how we move , we can we move , new and different styles of interaction .
I 'll start with some simple example .
This Siften is configurated to show , if it in a direction , the video running it , if you including the other side back back back .
These interactive rats are aware of other people .
If I do do do that , you know what they 're around .
If they 're circummit , they notice it and they can act a little bit .
If they 're circummit , they notice it and they can act a little bit .
They have been going to be their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power of the data , for example , " to put a color like a color like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurated as a sitting cabove and I can use them to the color in the middle , where you mix .
and I can use them to put them in the middle , where you mix .
If we 're going to get a lot of it , we can put a little bit .
They are also beautiful possibility of learning , like languages , the mathematics and games where people can prove the things fly , and you see the results of the immediately .
Now , I 'm --
This is a Fibonacci sequence .
We have a word of words that 's half in Scarabean and Boggle .
By , at all the time , you get a letter to any Siftable , in every turn to every turn to the letter to every turn to any letter in the Siftable , and while certainly try and control about a direceive .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you can remix , and you have a new set of letters and new chance to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the kids came to the game in the Media Lab , I did tried them and I took a video .
They were very much .
And one of the things that 's interesting about this application is that you don 't have to give people a lot of instructions .
You 've got to say , " Compones of the words , and they know what to do .
Here 's how other people who try it .
This is our own own younger tester , on the right .
It really wanted to impilate them .
They were only honces , for him .
Now , this is an interactive app .
We wanted to build a tool for the Lui appractical languages .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving Siftable to the Siftouched .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving Siftable to the Siftouched .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sunlight is sunlight .
David Merrill : Now he 's taken a treat the scene .
Video : The arange arange .
By work ! Yeah ! Yeah !
So I school by I school , and I hit up to put up neighbors --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing their own story .
Video : Hoo !
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him how it 's going to be able to do it .
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him how it 's going to be able to do it .
Video : Voly , gets .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool , realized , to walk and realized music .
It 's a tool , realized , to wait , to walk and make music .
Siftable here , they 're going to be like battery , based and the battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also insert these sounds in a sequence to buriers to your fall .
And they just modify it to do a " and a sequence . "
These are actually you can control from the vive , like the reverbs and the filter .
I 'm going to a particular sound , and then including it .
And then there are the general effects as time and fly , and fly , which you know , you know ,
Let 's look at how it works .
DM : DM : We 'll start to put a base in two Siftable Siftable , we 're going to get them to a series , we add the base .
I put a bottom line .
Video : DM : Now I added percussions --
DM : And I 'll put the filter to the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the vive .
DM : DM : DM : DM : I can fly the whole sequence by a time or on the other .
Video : And I 'll add the filter to the low to the flow to the flower to get more expression .
Video : DM : DM : I can recombine the sequence .
So I don 't have to plan it first , but I can improvising it , make it longer or the short .
And now , finally , I can spent the entire sequence the left to the left the Siftable Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new murders , more and more like the way , and more like our brain work .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this , and also some chance that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that 's coming this new generation of projects designed to interacting with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writer .
And I 'm writing books , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and the love of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But I said this , something particular happened in my life and my career , and I said , to recently recently , recently , I 'm going to realibrate the whole relationship with this work .
The particular thing is I recently wrote this book , this biograph called " Manogy , " Manogy , Prega , Ama , " which , diversity , for some reason , and it became a big sensationship , and become a huge , sensationship , bestseller .
And the result is that everywhere you now , people treat me as if I was convicted .
Do -- condanned , convicted ,
They 're going to me to worry and say , " Don 't you get to do better ?
You don 't have fear to keep writing for all life without power to create a book that can important to someone who 's going to do someone ?
What can it important to someone ?
It 's rassure , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember the 20 years ago , when I started to say , people -- I was a adolescent adolescent -- I was a writer .
I meet the same reaction of the same reaction .
And people said , " Don 't temes I 'm not going to be able to succeed ?
Don 't you fear that the humiliation of the reflute killed ?
You don 't have afrants to do this all of life without that nothing that you ever get out and death on a cumulate sowers to stop a crawling to hell on the foot of fallisment ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yeah , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I 've always had afraid .
And I also fear of many other things that people could not have to have .
As the algap and other things .
But , as I think of it was write about and I thought , and I would ask me , and I would say , "
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone who has to wait to be spaved by a work that you feel like to do .
But what 's this particular in the creative impress to make us nervous about health in a minute , in a way that other people do not ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember a only in his 40 years of activities where he was asked if he was asked to be engineer ?
Never -- that block of the John , how to go ?
Don 't work that , you know ?
Onests , chemicals like a group of the chemistry , they drive the reputation of being alcoolied by the reputation of being handed .
We have enough this reputation , we have enough this reputation , and not only the creative , but creative of every geneous , we have this reputation of being huge .
And they 're not going to look at the sad of the creative deaths of the creative magnificent , only in the 21st century , they died young and often for them .
And the ones that are not suicides seem to be real disfaced by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he die , in the last interview said , " Every my book killed me a little more . " A extraordinary affermation about work .
But we don 't buy the bad digital , when we feel this , because we 've heard these things that we 've completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and the notion is that creativity and the art , at the end , at the end .
And the question I want to bring all over today is : you know , you know , you know , what about ?
It 's OK this thing -- because also look at it from a hundred distance to me , it 's not good for anything this suppose .
I think it 's hate .
And I think it 's dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encourage our big creative minds to live .
And I know that , I know that , in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start at the end of the dark , especially to the surround , especially to the circumstances where I 'm in my career .
That 's really -- you look at this , they 're pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I 'm young .
I 've still got about four decades in me .
And it 's very likely to write about now , it 's going to be judated from the world as the work that was going to go out of my last book .
I 'm going to be square , because we 're all likely to be that my biggest success is to my shoulder .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that leads to start behind one person to start behind hind a morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep to keep doing this work that I love .
So , the question is , how ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflections , that the way to work to keep write is to create a psychological cougical protected , OK ?
I had to find a security distance of security between me , which I 'm written , and my natural anxiety on which reaction will get . And , as I was trying to all the time , trying to be looking through the time , trying to find other societies to see if they could have the best ideas and health care about how to be ideas and snailing .
about how to help creative people to manage the emotional inerent emotional reativity .
And that research took me to the Great and ancient Rome .
Seep me because it gets to the circle and then back .
In the Great and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity was giving that creativity from men , OK ?
He thought it was that creativity is this spirit is about the injumped and that was in the men , and unknown , for reasons and unknown .
The greeeef called these spirits of creativity .
Socrate , wonderfully , he believed to have a demon that elevening wisdom .
The Romanes were the same idea , but they call that spirit the kind of spirit .
And the great , because the Romanes were not really thought that a genius was someone who was particularly smart .
They had to think that a genius was this kind of entities that created living in the walls of a artist , a little bit like the elfy Dobby , and that came out to care of the artist , and the living of the articulate work and model the result of that work .
Exctional -- here is the distance of which I speak about -- that psychological cougical that you protected from your work .
And everybody knew that it was so that it worked , right ?
So the anti-to-certain artists were protected by certain things , like the too narcisixes , right ?
If your work was except for your work was not to take all the way , everybody knew that was helped by this genius .
If your failure , it wasn 't all your own , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable .
And so people han conceived creativity in the West for a long time .
And then Renascivvvent came and everything changed , and it 's born this big idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe on the misters and and no longer and let 's go to the devices that write by divinity .
This was the Rational of humans and people started to think that creativity was completely from the ishing ilient .
And for the first time in the story , you start to refer this or that artist as a rather than a genius in a rather than one person in the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think that allow someone , just to believe , a simple person to believe as a recipient as the source , and the source of all mystery mystery , creative , inknowledge and ethrow is a responsibility to a very big truly psychchches .
It 's like to ask someone to ingue the sun .
Deform and completely destroyed and creates all these inexistable inestible on the performance .
And I think it was this to have been this pressure to the artists in the past 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think it 's the question , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and creative mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of rational thought in a 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would be able to be legitimate the scientific notion of , unsometimes , you do that they follow people to spend on their projects .
Probably not to convince you all about this .
But the question I 'd like to take is -- why not ?
Why not to think that way ?
Because it 's more sense of anything that ever ever heard to explain to explain the exasperformance of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever ever ever ever tried to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- it doesn 't buy rationally .
And , in fact , sometimes it seems to completely paranormal .
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poetetesse Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but it was a poetesse for all life and told me that during his childhood in the Virginia , working out in the Virginia , and he was working out in the rural , and he heard it was in the paay .
He said , " I 'm like a broker of air .
And that was rotating to her from the landscape .
He heard it to come , because it was so much of the land under his feet .
He knew you to have one thing to do at that point and it was , " that it 's words like a math . "
And so it goes back home and came from this poem , and it wouldn 't have to make a piece of paper and a crap , while the trapp , and he would take it , and he would take it and slauce it , and he would take it on the page .
Sometimes you couldn 't be fast , so that it would be run and correced to the house and the poem rotles through her and he would keep her through her and he would keep it and keep rotolar through the landscape , and they keep rotolating , like , " he said , " another poet . "
Then there were the time -- this piece , I 'm never going to forget -- there were moments where it was almost losing , right ?
So , it was running up to the card and the poem was looking through , and the poem was going through , and he was a hyourself in , and then he said , " Well , that was like you smoke up with the other hand the coffering .
And he was walked the poem from the tail and reputting it in his body and transmit on page .
And in these cases , the poem was shown on the perfect page and intact , but on the last word at the first word .
So when I feel that -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly equal to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a mulo , and my way to work is , and wake up to the same time every day and I 'll go and go and go to go and go and go on on the godddly .
But even I even , in my mind , I 've striked against that thing , at sometimes .
And I 'm imagine that many of you , the han fact .
You know , even if the work work and ideas were to me from a certain source I could not honestly know .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it to do it , but , rather , rather , what does , but rather , rather , what does it do you get to save us ?
As the best example of me , the best example of the Tom Waits , which I have been interviewed Tom Waits , which I interviewed a different newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of the artist came back , trying to contemporaneous , trying to control , and retrofer , to dominate these species of inhyourself , involved in the same way .
But then I invent , he was calculated , and one day as he was driving on a drive to a floor in Los Angeles , he changed everything for him .
It was going to fast fast and all of a sent tract this little broadly broadly , which is in his mind as inspiration , and straight it , and the wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and it wants , but not as to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , has not a match , it 's not a register .
So it begins to feel this kind of old anxiety growing in him , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'll obsessed by this song lost , and I 'll get the obsessed by this song lost .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , they stop .
And he was completely new eventually process and made something completely new .
And he just look at the sky and he said , " Don 't see that I drive ? "
" You know , " Do you know , " Do you know ?
If you really want to be , back to a more opporter when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you go to important somebody else today .
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his work , and then working process .
Not work , the work was still dark like .
But the process , and the fish anxiety that was re-left , when the genius , the genius , the genius that was going to do something else that we had to do it back to where it was , by making it from , and the way .
but it 's got this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange thing that allowed and external thing that allowed was not Tom .
So how much the story started to change a little bit the way I worked , and I worked , and I was save me once .
This idea , I was writing , " Manogy , Prega , Ama , and I cadds in one of those cave dispersation where we all cave when we 're working on something and we don 't do and we can 't start to think that it 's going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst written .
Not only bad , just the worst book .
And I started to think about gone this project .
But then I remind to the air and I tried to do it .
So I got my face in the manished and I realized my hundred a vacuum corner .
And I said to high voices , " What , we know that if this won 't be brilliant book , not be interaction , it 's going to be all my , not going to be interaction , not ?
Because as I see it 's what I 've got , I 'm going to do , not have more than this .
So if you want to be better , you have to introduced and make your part .
Okay . But if you don 't do it , I know what , I don 't do .
I 'm going to writing the same because my work .
And I 'd like to do that I 'm now , I 'm presented to do my part of the world today , " because -- at the end is so , OK -- secoins ago , in North the people were sitting for the midddle of the launch of the launch of the launch of the hours and hours .
And they were always magnifices , because the balleras professionals were and wonderful .
But every once , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists was actually transendent .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you all seen it , at some point , a performance like this .
It was like the time stops , and the dance ballery , and it walked through a kind of a bral branching and not doing anything different from the usual , but it was moving up .
And suddenly , not appeared as a human .
But you accurated from the divinity in the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , at the time , people knew what was , they call it with her name .
They knew hands and started canting , " Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , God . "
That 's God , you know .
Curious known -- when Ms invasero -- when Ms the South , the South , they took this habitude with their own and pronounders changed in the secles from " Allah , " Ole , " the site , " which is , " which you can still feel in the round or the floor in the floor .
In Spain , when an artist has done something that impossible and magic , " Allah , the word , Allah , magnific , burst , " ununderstandable , " -- a God of God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But the problem is coming the day after the dance , the dancing dance , when you wake up and find that they 're the 11 of Martedyes and I won 't have it .
It 's just a worter bad with ginock , and perhaps never to get to that height .
And perhaps name the name of God , while I still have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most pain recilization to make life .
But perhaps not need to be so angoods , if you can 't believe , inside , the most extraordinary aspects of your being coming from yourself .
But you just believe that they 're going to you from a unimaginable source of this squisite of your life that you have to have to go to somebody else when you 've finished .
And , you know , if we think it 's this way of changes .
And so I started to think , and it 's certainly like this , and it 's just like this , I thought , in the work of the book that I publishing , I 'm going to publishing , I 'm going to do it , and I 'm going to think about it , and it 's a very success .
And what I have to keep to keep when I feel elected by this is , not fear .
Not to go . It 's just your work .
Continua presentest for your part , any way , whatever it could be .
If your work is dancing , ball .
If the divine , absurd genius to let me walk up with a few kind of wonderful kind of wonderful , for one moment through your effort , then , " Oh ! "
Otherwise , do the same your dance .
And " Ole ! " Oh , " Oh ,
I think I guess it has to teach it .
" Ole ! " at yourself , even for the hyourself , for a living love and touching tals to make you keep up continuously .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And you know , I 've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , what it 's going to mean , and the discovery of genes .
Now we 're starting a new way : we started to digitalize biology and now , we 're going to digitalize biology , we 're enting a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We 've always tried to bring big questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists , I think they 've been trying to figure livels .
We tried different approaches , reducing it to the terms .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was to go from the analog world in the digital world of the computer world .
Now we ask us : can we regenerate life , or create new from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome that they can authoreum in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little more smaller .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of the way .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple to our .
I redetecting me , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , is very unlikely that this can bring a living cell a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to provided it was synthesize this cromosoma so that they could modify the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " Pomosoma , " Cromosoma ? "
The chemistry connecting these big molecules that we never could create before create before we could now ?
And , in a conermatively , can we work a cromosoma ?
A cromosoma is just a piece of chemist material .
The speed that speakers we can digitalizing is growing to exponential life is growing to exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead of procreates rather slowly , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results the results to a exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process requires requires , beginning with a biothic review before we started the first experiments .
But we found that that synthesize of DNA is very hard .
There are tentens of thousands of machines in the world that are producing small segment of DNA , the lectively , the lectively is , the longer segment is , the longer segment , the more herrors .
So we had to develop a new way to assemble these brothers and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , to start digital information , and the IIgenome , 174 .
It 's a little bit of batteries that kills .
We designed the fragments , effectively the recorrection of errors and I got a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material , and we put it in the bacteria , and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and producing the viral particles .
The viral particles have been releft by the cells , are back and they distroyed the E. coli .
I 've talked about recently with meaning of the oil industry said that they have certainly compressed this model .
They remember the more than you .
We believe this is a situation where the software can actually build the same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the bigger things in big big .
We wanted to build the whole cromosoma of the bacterium .
They 're over 580 miles reading genetic code .
So we thought we could build it in the size of the virus , so that we could change the casses to understand what the components of a living cell .
The design is critation , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these are to be very accurate .
When we sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 , accuratezing was a mile for every 10 miles .
We found , resequence it , 30 error . If we had the original sequence , we never would have been able to do it .
One part of the process is to design segments that are survive in the 50 letters that are survive with all the other 50 letters to build the smaller subunity that working together .
We try to do the only one here .
You 've probably read that we put on the physical filighter .
Think of this : We have a genetic code four letters : A , C , G and To .
Three of those letters together codify about 20 minoacids , and there 's a specific order to every adminoacid .
So we can use genetic code to write words , framework , framework , thoughts .
What we 've done in the beginning was autograph .
Some of them have been to the fact that it wasn 't poem .
We designed these segments to just to join them .
There are enzymes that repair them and they put them assimed .
And we started assemble to assemble parts , starting with five to segments from five to seven miles , unending up to 24 miles letters to be able to make 24 miles letters .
We 've all the step we produced these sequency in abundance so that we 're trying to create a very very very robustood -- you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to authentic .
So , this seems like the tabellon a basket playoff .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 thousand , over 100 thousand , they 're not going to grow in the E. coli .
It 's coming to the modern instruments of molecular biology .
So we looked at other way .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination , which in biology , which in biology , in biology , which is using DNA can une the segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , it can absorbed three million rad of radiation .
You can see in the superior as the cromosoma is to destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it seems to be before .
They are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms you can be completely .
They can live under the empty .
They 're absolutely certainly that life exists in space , and you know , to find new water environments .
In fact , NASA showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built , just using these processes , just using the lightful design of the segments to insert .
The least assemble them automatically .
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It 's a big molecule that we can see it with a law microscope .
These are pictures that cover a six seconds .
This is the publication we 've done a little time ago .
They 're over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the biggest molecule of a defined structure that the man 's ever created by the man .
It 's got a weight molecular heighs .
If we were going to get it with a 10 without spaces , it would like 142 pages , it would like 142 pages to transform this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we activate it ?
Obviously , you love a virus is a game .
It 's a little more complicated when you use .
It 's easier even when it comes to ekarios as our ekariote as our : you just get the nucleus and put another , which is basically the clonation .
In the archaea , the cromosoma is instead inside the cell , but we 've recently demonstrated that we 're able to do a transplant cromosoma from a cell to another and activity .
We could have a cromosoma parting from a microbial species .
The two are different as the men from the topi .
We 've added some gene in more way that we could decide what choose for this cromosoma .
The later sent , with the enzyme , so that we kill the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell cell was stupendent -- and you 'll appreciate our sophisticatos -- the new cromosoma is went into the cell .
And we really started thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we 've tried to spingering us in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We 've found that many species have added to a second or a third cromosoma , to add a thousands of new tracts to the species .
So who think evolution as only as a gene at the time that you have no understood for the biology .
They are in the enzyme called restriition that advantage of restriition that they are digm .
The cromosoma that was in the cells , it 's not a way .
The cell phone that we 've got to cell phone that we put it .
And it 's expressed , and he recognized the other cromosoma as the expressed material , and we were returned with only the cromosoma and the new cromosoma .
it became blue because of the genes we put .
And in a short leaving time , all the characteristics of a species are went to a new species , and it turned around into a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cell .
All the proteins are changed , the member , and when we read the genetic code exactly what we 've been transfer to what we 've transfer to what we 've transfer .
Now , this may seem alchemissioned , but by the software DNA , we can change things in a pretty much fundamental .
Now , I 've already explained that here is not speak of genesis -- but we realize to the three million years and a half evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian explosion .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty obvious when we think about our needs .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion to nine to the next 40 years .
Right to give you an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each other in 1946 , there 's four , there will be four .
We 're going to find problems now to find food , fresh water , and clean , medicinals and benzine for six billions .
It 's going to be more training to nine billion .
We use five billion coal , more than 30 billion bets , more than 30 billion oil baries .
That means millions of baries a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or whatever kind of process to reduce them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep all the way of CO2 emission from these materials that ends in the atmosphere .
Now , today , because of the scientific discoveries around the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the designed for the future .
The electronics industry only only has a dozen dozen of components , and think about how many different things came out .
Our limitations are here , the limitations of biological reality , and our imagination .
Now we have the techniques , because of these rapid metods of synthesization , able to create what we call genomics combatory .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million cromosomes a million cromosomes a day .
Think about processing these 20 million different genes or to try to get the processes to produce either eight-year-old , and new vaccines , we can change , because of a little team , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology , and more biology , and create more biology .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for a chance of survival , chemicals , chemicals , chemicals , production of vaccine ,
This is an instantaneous instantaneous software programmed to be able to seat and design species to the computer .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how they will be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
Now we 're concentrating on what we 're going to concentrating on what generation .
You 've seen you that they 're ethanol from the grate was a finished experiment .
We have a second , and third generation that will be surround enough to the cooking cooking , as much higher value as the otan or different types of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact on without more impact the cost of food and limitate the cost of food and limitate the availability to transform CO2 in matter , and we 're working for design cells that can make this purpose , and we think we could have the first cost , and we think we could have the first carbons of what it 's going to be able to be about 18 months .
The light solar light sunlight on the CO2 is a metodownstroyed -- but in our discoveries all the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we 've described in 1996 .
It lives in the ocean , about 2,500 feet of deep deep in the water .
They removing from CO2 using hydrogen molecular hydrogen molecular source .
We 're trying to figure out if we can incanalone , which can easily be transmitted by the way , convert that CO2 in fuel , to drive this process .
So , we think we could make what we can make the basic question of the basic question , " which is life . " And we have the basic modity . " We have the goal of reduce -- we have the gotten industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where can you ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And also , we 're working on the same way , we 're working on the same way .
You 've seen this year with the flu , we 're always back in a year and with a dollar in less when it 's a dollar in less .
I think that that you can change by combination .
So , this is how the future could start to look change , now , the evolution of evolution , acceling the evolution with synthetic bacteria , and then finally cellubrate ekariote .
We 're so from the best people .
Our purpose is to do a long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
I 'll give you , the most rapidly possible , some fundamental work , some fundamental work , new technology that we took the Microsoft in the next year , exactly , exactly , this is Seadragon .
It 's a environment where you can interacting is to local level that remote with a huge amount of data .
We 're seeing here , so many gabytops of digital photos with a kind of zoom , and continuous , for a panoramic speaking , disponing the images like we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these are the data or the images .
Most of the photographs , but this is a digital scan from the Biooe from the Bioe of Congress , and reached in the 300 megapie .
Not any difference because the only thing that limits prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen on your screen in your screen . It 's a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data , not not images .
This is Dickens is Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
To show you that it 's about textbook and not images , we can do something like that , to really make a kind of thing , to really show that it 's a real representation of the text , not a photo .
It could be a little artificial way to read a electronic book .
Not you .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the beautiful and the experience of reading the real version of a magazine , or a quotian of a fifth of a fidddle , which is for nature a molteplice .
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of the Guardian .
We created a higher advertising to higher resolutionary -- much higher than one in a normal advertising -- and we put you in the extra crowd .
If you want to see the caractil of this automobile , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limitations of space on the screen .
We hope that that means to put up to the pop-up and other symps , and other symps , not had to be necessary .
Of course , mapping is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if not to say that we have contributes to give up in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. . Howner physical image of NASA .
So , we go to something else .
This is now actually , in the web of the web ; you can see it .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
A is Seadragon and the other is a visual research , very interesting research by Noh Snavority of the University of Washington , with Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve , the U.W and the U.S. . .
And it 's from Seb , gestite from Seadragon .
You can see this when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from an image to the other kind of experience , and have this kind of experience to multiple .
But the space of the images here has actually a meaning meaning .
The algorithms of visualization computers have recorrespond these images together , so that they correspond to the real place in the recorrespond to the recorrespond to the Grasks on the Montagne Rocciose Roccious , and they 've been taken . So you see the elements of a sliden show , and these things have been all the space that you see elements have been able to be able to the space .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space space .
I want to go to directly one of the original data set of Noahholding , and this comes from a Phototype of Photosynthrow that we 've done for the first time , the technology , the Phototy-by-scorce . And it 's not necessarily evident to show you what the technology , the technology , Photoxist . And it 's not necessarily evident .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of the Law Dame . The Flickr , Flickr , I 'm going to digitar in Flickr , and you get images in the maglight-of-up representing , other campus and so on . Except in the way , and you have to find out .
So they 're all images from Flickr , and they were all colleaged to the space level in this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this way simple .
You know , I 'd never have thought I 'm going to end to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying to get this kind of ackle here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different types of different sorts of phones in the phones in the Leals to the professional SLR , a significant number , meaning , put together in this environment .
And if I can go , I try to try to look at the strange .
Most of you have been blocked by faces , etc .
And somewhere here is a set of photographs -- and that 's a lot of photographs -- and that .
This is a Notre Notre Dame recorrectly .
We can move from the physics to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with the social environment . This now is taking data from the entire collelets , from the collelets , from vision of vision -- and college all those data together .
All those pictures are linked together , more than the som of the parts .
You have a model of land that 's emerges .
Think about this as a Stephen Lawler 's work on Earth .
It 's something that growing in complexity as people who are using it , and the advantages for people to use it .
Their pictures are sea with methers , they 're saying by other people .
If somebody comes the idea of meet to meet all these saying the name , my photos of Notre catthedral of Notre , you know , you know , the way I can use it as a meaning of all these data , and I can use it to dive in that space , in that metaphor , using the social experience of cle-mo-cle-cle-mo-cle-cle-cle-mo-in-user cle-cle-moon-user .
Of course , a consequence of this is virtual model of all interesting , in the earth , collected by all interesting , collected from satellite images and satellite images and similar images , but from the college memory .
Thank you .
CA : I 've got to understand ? What ? What your software will will be able to do is that at some point in the next few years , all the photographs , all the photographs , all the photographs , they will be related together together ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is doing is basically discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the basis in the injected .
The thing is very interesting if you think about the rich of the semantis that many of these images that many of these images are possible .
As you make a research of images on the Web , you digital page , and the text on the web page has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what if that pictures you connects to all your pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of rich interconnection and the amount of rich that is really huge . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure when you travel and one of the research of the ethnographics is the power that living between the anti-traditions , between the anti-traditions , the past in the wind , the pleass in the floor , it 's driving in the floor , it 's driving in the fleap .
Basti think that the Jaguar travel even beyond the Lattea , or that the old Inuit , or the old Inuit , the Milky , or in Himalaya , the buddddies still , to remind the importance of the Dharm , to remind the importance of the world , and that the idea that the world that we don 't live in sense , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of adaptations that our own own own styple , right or a lot of generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
We all hire . Everybody 's procreate .
We 're going to be able to be initiation .
We have to deal with the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprising and ballize --
We all have an art .
What it hits is particular lights is the particular song , the dance of the dance of every culture .
Not matter that they 're the Penan 's 's the Mild 's Borneo , or the following of Haiti , or the Haiti , or the Kaisut in Kaisut in Kenya Saharm , or a Curander in the Curandering in the Cura 's heart in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my travel companion in the desert a month ago , or a yak high , or a yak of the Qomolanger , on Everest , the mother of the world .
All of these people teachers are teaching us that there are other ways to think , other ways to move in the world .
And if you think , if you think , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
Insit , cultures of the world 's cultures create a spiritual life and cultural life that we wanted the planet and is important for the well-being of the planet as the planet as the planet as the rags .
And you can think about this cultural ragnature as a a nsphere and you can defining ethnosphere , the total of all the concepts , dreams , moving , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions ,
The etnosphere is the patrimony of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how inquisitive species .
And because of the biosphere was fera was very much consumed by the ethnosphere and purthnossphere .
Nothing biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species is on the bear of the extinction simply because it 's false -- in the most optimistic exhypocalytical -- and you don 't even even even a little hypothesis -- that of the cultural diversity .
The index of all that is , of course , the language .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a gap or a series of rules .
A language is the spraw of human spirit .
It 's the midddle of which the animal of every culture comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a bacin mind , a spiritual thought , a spiritual ecosystem .
And those 6,000 languages , while we sat Monterey , at least half , at least half , it 's not surrated in the ears of kids .
They don 't get more teached to kids , which means , unless than not willing something , which are already death .
What 's more sad than the sad than the silence , the last last to talk to a language , not to have a language , not how to transmit the wisdom of the kids ?
This remember is the state of someone in the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , a moment , and it 's brings with the last syllabe the last syllabe of a ancient language .
And I know somebody who will say , " Isn 't it anymore ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we talk about the same language ? " Bensim , then we talk to all yoruba .
Let 's talk about kogs .
You 'll cover a translation what it means not to speak their language .
I 'd like to do you a journey through the ethnosphere --
a little journey in ethnossphere to give you a assassage of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of exists , I mean , " it really different ways of exists .
Let 's take for example this Barasana , in Amazon Amazon Secentrional anaconia , which creats the myth of the snails , which creats the meast of the snails .
It 's a popular popular that 's not able to distin the blue color from the green because the celests is identified in the time of the forest , which depends the popular popular .
They have a strange language and a main language , details , " exogamia " : you have to marriage one person who 's a different language .
Everything has radicals in the past , yet the particularity is that in these families that are in these families that you 're talking about six or seven language .
They 're limited to listen to listen to .
Let 's take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waorani in the Ecuador , a popular popular that has the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have taken a commodity .
They did come up from the higher photographs that they were in a few people who were in a very few adished , forest that this popular population had never seen bi-dimensional forest .
They collected the photos , they turned to the research , and not find nothing , and , not find nothing that they were acting the diavel , and they killed the five missionarious with the lazing .
But the Waorani only killed the straneyers .
They killed to kill them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by the same .
We were likely to get generations and we found two natural cases , and when we got to know , they added to know , they added that one of them was aging , and then they were killed to this , and then they killed it , and they killed it the same .
The crawers were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early ' 80s , I was assigned a very interesting task when my Harvard professor of Harvard asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to the base of the Duvalier , and the Tonton Macoutes , and impossessing me of the speed of the speed that the speed of the speed to the zombies .
To give a sense to miraculous miracology , I should understand the Vodouth culture and that Vodought is not magnera .
It 's a pretty much of a complex metaphysical vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddddddism , etc .
A continent comes up , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has not been religious light-Saharan Africa 's faired and Vodoo is not that the other religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concept by the slavery of the slavery .
What makes the interesting voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , you know , you know , the spirits .
The spirits can be invocated by the Great Acqua , they respond to the dance of dance and replaced temporary to the soul of the way that for a little bit of the way that a little bit of the following gos .
So , the voodoists are saying , " You can go to ask God to talk about God .
We say in the temple and diventiate God . "
And the moment you 're going to be , is the spirit that you guide , how can you do you the bad ?
So you 're seeing these incredible events : follow voodoo in the state of trance that touch impunes such a rather strong demonstration , rather strong the body when it 's cataled in a state of extreme , when it 's cataled in a state of extreme extreme .
In all the people with which I lived the most amazing the most amazing the Kogi of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta , in Colombia sector .
Do you get to the ancient civilization that once living on the planning of Colombia in the conquery of the conquery , the population of the vulcanical mass that you erge on the planets .
In a blood continent , this popular sangue , this popular population .
And so , in fact , they have to be a clero , but they 're very extraordinary amazing .
The young people to come from the families to three to four years , and they live in a good world , and they live in a good world , and homeland homes in a world 's crowd to the ice of the ice of the ice for 18 years .
Two period of nine years choices to reproduce the nine months of gestation that spent in the user of the mother , they 're now metaphorically in the user of the Great Mother .
So , all of the time , they 're acculturated to their society , values that they predicts their predicted and only their predict and their predict to keep the cost ealing ecological ecological equilibrief .
At term of this incredible initiation , they 're suddenly taken out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 , they see a high . And in that account of the first cutting of the beautiful , when the sun of the beautiful landscape , everything that they learned in theory . The pre-theory comes up , and he says ,
" Vison ? I 'm going to say .
It 's amazing . Now it 's to you protect it .
They call the biggest brothers and say that we , brothers , brothers of the world 's destruction of the world .
This level is intuition is extremely important .
When we think about indeed populations and the environment we 're invity and the old story of the noble self-vages , which is a razy razy in his simplicity or perhaps in the way , and say that these people are closer to the Earth .
The popular popular indebults , or indebolites from the nostalogy .
There 's no space for these things in the malic palues in the Astststicks or the Tibet , but because of the time and the rites , they created a mystics of the Earth 's based on the end of the Earth 's based on a burn 't on the concept of the Earth can only live in the world , it can only live in the knowledge that the Earth can only live in the constress that the Earth can only live in the humans .
What does it mean ?
To say that a boy of Ande who growing Ande who growing the mountain is a spirit Apu that 's going to drive her destiny , it will be a different deep , and it 's going to be a different report of Montana , and it 's going to be a boy of Montana , who growing up a kid , which is a male of Montana that they grow that a mountain 's shouldn 't grow .
That 's the dimora of a spirit or a mineral cequivalent .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the report between the natural and the natural world .
I grew up in the forest of the Columbia Britannica creding that the forests service for being cut .
And that made me a human being from my Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the Hukuk dimora of Hukuk and the stories of the paradise and the stories of the paradise and the downbals that live to the extreme in the world , spirits that they 're dealing in the beginning .
If you start to consider that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of their sensitive sensationals . We take this plants .
I took this picture to open in the north-doctor Amazon Northetic .
Maybe some of you heard about the ayahuasks , the most powerful chapactive sustainance .
What makes the ayahuasks the ayahuasks is not the physical potential of the sustainance , but his elements . It 's composed to two two elements .
And from a moon , this leaving legnose that contains a beautiful set of ra-carbolin , harmine harmine , slightly hallucinogens .
Take the solar plant is a blue that I 'll alters a little cocket , but it 's mixed with the leaving leaves of a family Psychotridis .
This plant contains switch , very similar to the seroonin the serotonin the methoxyltryltryltryltryptamine-methoxyltrylessy .
If you ever see Yanomami , you know , you know , the nass that make from a different set of species , ancher contains methoxyltryltryltryltryltrylessy .
Are that polly-a-drive on the nose is like being disappeared by a pink of pink and land on a sea of electricity .
I knew with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wake the man who waiting the psychephysical fungi in the ' 30 in Mexico .
I mean , my thesis , you can 't get these triptamines like hallucinogens because if you 're not telling any of hallucined hallucined . And you can 't tell any beautiful , they can 't be hurrally because they are money from a supply indeed with the inept that you are naturally in the intestine , detection , detailed by the way , detailed in the intestine , detectures of course ,
It 's possible to absually ababsually if you 're assumping with other chemicals that denaturate MAs .
Now , the beautiful : the beta-carbolin that liana are injuana are injuana are injuana , the same kind of need to potential tripamine . The question is , in a spontaneous 80,000 species of plants , how they do these people are not , but that if you combine two men . But if you combine this , believe that it 's suddperior that 's sometimes the sometimes ?
We use the big euate euphy of proof and error , which can revealing .
But if we ask the Indians , they will tell us , " The plants are talking about it . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuasks , which are nectively in the forest , and that we will get in the forest , and that we would have to the same .
If we asked him how they 're going to stage their tasonomy will tell us , " I thought about plants , you don 't know what ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take the 17 varieties in a night of moon and each other , and each other , it 's going to be able to a different .
With this is not sleeping to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that to count stami stams .
Now , the problem is that also the problem is that the ones of us who have heart the populs in the ingenes are pittoresthetic populations in the history of the story in the real world , and it 's going to be in our real world , and it 's going to be in our real world , and it 's going to be over .
In fact , the 20th century , it 's not going to be reminded for his wars or its innovations , but rather like the early was where we were stopped and we used to activate the destruction of the planet . Now , activity of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All cultures through the sect have been involved in a dance for new chance of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux didn 't stop being Sioux when they put from the areas and they did not stop being stopped by the horse and horse .
It 's not the change or technology that they minacting the integrity of ethnosphere .
The flight over the domination .
And if you look at the world , you find that these are not cultures that these are not cultures are cultures to disappear .
They 're living creatures and dynamics out of identify existence from identify forces that go beyond their adaptation .
Which is that you have to disbowl in the Patria of the Penan --
a popular popular Sarak , in the South West , an popular popular popular , and now reduced to the forest to a generation , and now reduced to the service and prostitution on the redress , where you can see the floor of the light-half Borneight-half a Borneo in the MCinese Merar , where the naves high ,
Take up the standing stand the wood to the forest .
Or , in Yanomami , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease come to the discovery of the gold .
If we move on the mountains of Tibet , where I 'm doing many research , you 'll see the hard of political domination .
As you know the genocide , physical extinction of a popular popular , is condent at the universal level , but the destruction of the lifetnocide , not only is condent , but it 's not condent , but it 's a great advantage , because it 's part of the strategy development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet , until you 're part of the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in the West in the Tibet , in the Tibet , coming to Lhasa with a young colleague , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what the statistics is that we feel about .
6,000 sacred monuments to hold and holds .
1.2 million people killed by the military military during the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical to the Panchen Lama .
which means it was killed to the Chinese temples .
His the flew with Sua Santity during the diaspora that led the people in Nepal .
His mother had been impressed and her color was rich .
It was taken to hide on the age of two two years born under the age of two years , because it wouldn 't live in him .
The sister , who did the same , was in the field of reeducation .
One day has been walked up a raffered fasm a raffering in Mao and , for this transgression , was the works for seven years .
The Tibet can be insopportable , but the spirit of the people 's popular to the people 's popular .
As the end , all of all the way .
We want to live in the world monoh , or we want to acks the polowned world , or we want to acght the polowned world ?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he die said that her biggest fear was that , in our going to go to this love of the world , not only we 'll see the whole gamm of the human imagination , but one day we 'll see us from a sleep in a modality of the way , but one day we 'll see from a sleeping of a sonnot only that we have other possibility .
And it 's umiliating our species is for 600,000 years .
The Neolitic Rivolution , who given us the agriculture , who made us to the cult of the seed cler , replacing the poem of the sler , creating the poem of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has been 300 years .
And that 's a story that we have the answers that we have the answers to all the challenges that we should do to be a thousand enhancestors that we have to get .
When these miric measurements of the world is asked what it means to be human , they say , " human , they say , " We say with 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all all risky the chance to be what we are -- a species that has to make all the people and all the people 's populations and all the gardens can truly floor . And there 's great moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the northrow of the island of Baffin , when I went to the hunting hunting hunting with the dalens of the island of the Balin the island of the Braised history of his grandfather .
The government canader was not always gentle with the Inuit and the 1950s to stage our surface , we ran them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refuted to go .
The family , teaching his life , and took him away all the arms , and all his attitude .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't teach the cold , exploit .
The bats of the sliterally bad balades were made of cartoes .
The grandfather than this man didn 't intimise from the arctic night or the libraries .
It 's gathering out , it 's hot the pantalone in the foca and defected in your hand . When I did the hand . When I did the bad , they 've been working on a moment .
He 's spred on the door of this caccept caccept and when I became solid , he killed a dog .
He wasn 't the dog and created a brid , with the house cash , he created a sliterally , he was imbrid to another dog , and it 's disappeared on the flkey , the cell phone in the remains .
We want to talk about cavarsely with nothing ? [ Rism ] And this , in different ways , in different ways , and Apausi , the symbl of the Inuit of the world 's resilience of the world 's resilience .
In the 1999 , the canader government reached the total control of a territory area of a larger territory area of California and the Texas messed .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's an independent territory . They 're all going to be a minerary record .
One splay , example of how a natione-state can remind with his people .
And , finally , I think it 's pretty obvious at least at the one of us was in these remote zones of the planet , to make it connected that they 're not remote .
For someone is home .
They represent sections of human imagination that they get to the top of the days . And for us all , the dreams of these kids , like the dreams of our kids , become part of the hope .
And finally , we have National Geographic , we convinced that politicians will never get to nothing .
We believe the polemiics --
[ Applausi ] not be , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the world stories . Every site . Every month is 35 million visitor .
156 countries transmit our television canal canal .
Our reviviols are literally laughts from millions of people .
Our work is travel to bring our audience in places of wonderful cultural places from which they will go away from how they go away they 're going to the clean out of the crazation of the anthropology : the world 's world 's taking exists in the middle of the anthropology , and multicultural redent
where the wisdom of all popular popular wisdom to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope that you 've already heard and proverse to evidence some links , in the case , not nothing .
I want to start with what I call " the " official dogma dogma . "
The official dogma of what ?
The official dogma of all the West IMMMuilills : " If we want to massimize the well-being of our citizen citizen . "
The reason is , from a mother , in fact that freedom is in the same a value , is precious , useful , behumans .
The other one is in the fact that if we 're free , each of us can act for their connecting to do everything that massive ourselves , not no one that decided in our well-being , not no one that decided in our well-being .
The way to massive freedom is massive freedom .
More choices , the more are free , and more are free , and more , the more , is their benth .
This , I think , it 's so deeply radicated in the society that nobody would dream to put it in doubt .
And it 's also deeply radicated in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has ress possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I lost a simple note about conditivegetable .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditivements , without content 10 varieties of oil and 12 oil and 12 acetes and 12 acetals that you can buy for you a huge number of conditions in the circumstance that none of the 175 cost 's going to your degree .
Here 's what supermarket .
Then go to the electronics to buy a stereo : At cassis , lector CD , lector , the CD , radio , the radio , pracer .
And in this single electronic negotid , there 's a big number of components .
We can realize six million different and a half of different combinations using the components that there are only in one negoties .
You have to admit that there 's a lot of choice .
Other the camps : the world of communications .
Once I was a child , you could get all the phone services of the phone phone , in the floor that they were provided by the mothers Bell .
He was to be the phone , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , between the phone , was that the telephone never break .
These days have gone .
We now have a variety of telephones , especially between the phones .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cut of the nose , and the foreign crowd to the crowed crowd .
If you don 't see it in the negotie in the home , you 're going to get some of it .
And what happens is that people enters are in the stops and ago this question . And you know , you know , what the answer is ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do it too many things .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important of the aquid aquid , you true the same choices .
Auxietary healthcare : it 's not going to the United States that you go to the doctor and doctor , you have to do .
Instead , wake up to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do . A , or B , " has these benefits and these risks " B , " has these benefits and these risks . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Dr. What should I do I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , and B has these benefits and these risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebate , " Dr. " If she was me , what would do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not her . "
The result of the result of the malate , expression that it seems like a beautiful thing .
But it 's not that a move the fish and responsibility to make decisions that something knows , which is , you know , to somebody else knows -- and almost of a doctor , and almost certainly maled -- and so it 's not in the ideal condition to make the patient .
There 's a huge marketing of pharmaceuticals , direct to people like me and you , that if you think it 's not a sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do they cleize them ?
The answer is that they want to doctor , we call the doctor for asking them to change the recipe .
Something that fundamental as our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this vision , as you see in this vision , " We don 't want to provide kids . We don 't want to be an identity : we need to inventire the right now , " We have to invent .
And we can reinventing that sometimes us .
which means that every morning , at the morning , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
I removing the family and marriage , a time , a time , a common time , unhappen to anyone , was that you marriage the most possible possible , and you start to make the early possible , and he was going to make the earlier possible .
The only real choose was with who , not when , and not even what to do after .
And it 's really going to play .
I teach very smart students , and I 'm 20 percent in less than I work with a time .
And not because they 're bright to be less , because they 're not going to be .
but why are they impensionally , I 'm going to ask , " I should wish or not ? I should say , " Would I do this right now ? "
" I should say later ? I have to think about before the or to the career ? "
They 're interrogative interrogoranange .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implies , but it 's not completely to get a beauties to my own examples to my examples .
And they really have to do it . They really important questions .
Now , the work : we 're fortunate , like Carl soil , because the technology allows us to work every minute , every day , every day , from the Hotel Randolle .
To parentanese , there 's a corner , and I 'm not going to tell you what , where the WiFi works .
Not say , because I want to use it .
What it means , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work ? It 's that we have to keep in the work ? It 's continuously in every moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son son playing , with the cell phone in a cell , Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the nail .
And even though they are all spent , every minute that we see our son roball of the game , we 're also asking this called ?
" I have to say , " I have to get this letter ? I had to hold this letter ? "
And even when the answer is no , " all this makes the experience of your son , very different experience from what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the things we look , large things , big , materials and the lifestyles , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Obs , there were some chance , but not all was a question of choice .
The world today looks like this : The dilemma is , " Is it a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Shall .
The positive soul slightly , so I 'm going to talk about the negative ones .
All this choice to do two negative effects on people .
The first one , paradoxially , paralysis that produces instead of liberation .
With options in which choose , which choose , becomes very hard to do it .
I offer you a significant study : a conducted study pians .
A colleagues had access to the Vanooo data , the giant society of the source of pension , with about a million clients of implemented in 2000 different companies .
What she found out is that for every 10 solutions that are offering in more , the adesion the floor of adesion , two percent .
With 50 source of offerts , there 's 10 percent in less adesions than when they are only five . Why ?
Because with 50 source of the floor , is maledly difficult to decide , and choose is remained to the inept .
And I 'm still going to ask , questions , questions , and I 'm sure , of course , and I never get .
You know that it doesn 't only mean that these workers are going to mangering food for canoes because they 're not going to be enough money , it 's so ostics that they lose the funding funding is so hating the funding of the work .
Not participating , they 're losing to five to a thousand dollars for year from the work , which would be very until .
So the paralysis a consequence of the choices .
And I think it makes the world .
" And finally , for the ethernity : ketchup , senape or maionese ? "
You want to take the right decision , if it 's for the ethernity , isn 't it ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong source , and not want to be the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoid paralysis and make a choice , and we 're at the end of the result of how we would have been with less options of the result of what we would choose .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditivocate between which choose , if you buy one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could make a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us industry , and the reduce deminulizes decreasures that they can be able by decision ,
And even when it was a good decision .
More choice is , the easier is easy to dispile-insection of any detailable option of choice .
And also , there 's what economists call constood called constood .
Dan Gilbert asked very well as a value that we do to do things about things that we do with .
In the rest , when there are many options , it 's easy to represent the characteristic , the existic fewer option of the option that you have choice .
Here 's an example . I school with all the people who are not New York .
But that 's what you probably think .
There is this couple to the Hamptons .
A place of lap .
It 's going to spend . Ottic day . It 's all for them .
Not missing anything . But what he thinks is , " Well , malth , it 's Auuugly . "
" Everybody my neighbors to Manhattan is away . "
" I could talk to right in front of home . "
And it 's going to spend two weeks from the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the chance of parking -- the chance of parking things .
The constood to the satisfation for what we have , even when choice was an excellent .
And the more than the options we have to consider , the more the characteristic characteristic will be reverse .
Here 's another example .
This vignize us a lot of things .
It 's about living the moment , and maybe the living slowly .
But the most important point is that any thing you choose to , you 're choose to do not to do other .
The things that we don 't choose to be active attractive that they can make less attractive .
Third point : it 's growing the expectations .
I tried to my skin buying a new jeans .
I 'm going to almost always jeans .
And once the jeans were only one , they bought them and wild summer , they were dissioned , they were dissioned , just after they were able to go .
So , I went to buy a couple when the old ones were went , and I said , " I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
And the commit said , " Look , " Hofter , he refit , he relaxed ? "
Do you want to go with the bodies or with the bodies ? " And the swashed , " or " across ? "
" Do you want to strapped them ? "
" Sotto them want to large or high holds ? Bla bla . "
I was slaughter , and after a little bit , I could say , " I want the kind of -- which was the only kind of , " I want to do the kind of , I tried to all the jeans , and then I came out of the jeans , and then I came out of the best jeans that I ever had .
It was the massive . And I got the whole choose to the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was worse for the worst of the things that I was in the mies were very high , jeans , jeans had to be perfect .
I started waiting the beginning . I didn 't expect to be except when there was only a kind of a kind of a hundred different kind of , but when I saw 100 different , at least one kind of have to be perfect .
What I was buy , I wasn 't perfect .
After I had compared that choose with what I was trying to do in the aspectops .
The addition of options in life of people don 't do that to increase the expeccellent of the options that these are responsible to the options .
And this will produce less so-disfation , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the marketing world , if you realize it .
Because if they knew it , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more like this .
" It was better when you were better when you were going to say , " The reason it was better when you were going to be able to meet when you were worse , you could meet .
The world that we live in the world that we live -- opulent , industrialized citizen , industrialized citizen , the massive that we can hope is that the things are at the height .
You never have surprised because your expectations , my aspectative , my aspectative , you have yet .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse , " Yeah , " Yeah , you want . "
I mean , a little authobiographic moment -- which I 'm really married and my wife is really stupid .
I couldn 't have to do better , I 'm not to do .
But it 's not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of jeans in discococococococococool when you 're just the kind of jeans is that when you 're not satisfacts , and you say , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " And the answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do you do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a pink insoddisfacing , and you ask who 's the responsible , is the responsible , it 's as a clear that responsible .
You should have done better .
With hundreds of available varieties , there are no way for the insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even though the result is , they feel inseed , they feel insatisfaced and they give the hell them .
In the last few years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but important -- not the only one , but important -- of this depression is that people have to deludgments of the depression of because the standards are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the colors is they think that the colors is .
So the end result is that in general , we 're better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remind you .
This is the official dogma , what we all all take for good and it 's completely fake .
There 's no drug that a little bit better choice is better than having a little bit better than haven 't at all that it 's going to be better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been superforated by a piece of the level where the choices are improve .
Now , from political view -- I 've almost finished -- from political view , the political nocity , the necture is the following .
What 's all about this choice in the industrial societies is the material .
There are many places in the world , and you know about that , where the problem is not they have too many choice .
The problem is they 're too a little bit of it .
So the face that I 'm talking about is a while modern exists , reminds societies .
And what does what makes to mention and arrage is this : Steve Levitt talked about how those cost and discovered to the books for baby are inuuuuuuuuuuuseful .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendes , it 's not that they 're just inuuseful .
They 're admitter to be .
They make it worse .
If a little bit of what in our societies allows allows choice was reverse in those people who are too few possibilities , it would not only be their lives , but also .
This is what economists call a paretian improvement .
A redistribution of redent does well , not only to the poor -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in a way that it comes back to us .
To conclude , " Fild , you can become everything that you want ,
You know , culture , you 'll think , " What does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get to a glass in a glass . "
" A cause imagination , a limited vision of the world --
and what I 've interpreted this , at the beginning .
But then , I think , instead , I realized that that the fish knowledge .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you eat me , the bock , so that " all you can 't get the freedom . You get the freedom .
If you break the bock in a way that all you can diminuliitous satisfation .
You 're going to take the paralysis , and you 'll reduced the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too , perhaps even for fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic sphere is a recipe for the fleck .
Thank you for heart .
