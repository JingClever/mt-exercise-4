I 've shown this year I showed these slides to demonstrate that the glacial calots , that for almost three million years had the size of the 48 States continental , it 's refed about 40 percent .
But this subjected the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice .
The article calots is , in a way , the heart of the global climate system .
It 's expanding and it 's reverse .
The next slide is going to be a fast carrying on the last 25 years .
The ice perennia are drawn in red .
And you see , they expand they 're going to the blue .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is the summmer .
You can see that the cosid-year-old ice , and five years or more , is like blood , that 's like blood , that here 's gone .
In 25 years , it 's spent from this ,
This is a problem because the warming of the interest in the land of the ice of the arctic ocean where there are enormous amount of coal congeled that , the leaving microbes , they 're transformed into the metrics .
I 'm going to say to the totality of the atmospherical of global warming , that amount of global warming , that amount of the way .
In some lage in some lage deep Alaska , the metane is already bolding on water .
The professored Katey Walter of Alaska has rected team with a team pressed a team in a lago , the scum .
Video : Wow ! You 're going to be good .
One reason is that this is that this thermal exchange from the Greenland from the north .
This is a glacial river .
The brought her never reached to sit levels .
This is the Kangerlusaq , in the southeast in the Southeast Greenland .
If you want to know how the level of the sea level of the melt to the sea mess of the sea .
These corrups are menting rapidly .
Another part of the planet : Antarctica , the biggest block of the planet .
The month of the scientists have clearly clearly in the negative , and that Antarctica , and the Antarctica , which are pogets on some islands , are particularly fast in the islands .
Equital to six meters of the handle , like in Greenland .
And the Himalaya , the third biggest block of ice , you see new lay , which few years ago were glaciers .
40 percent of the world 's population will be in the water from the slide .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the source of this city .
The brought it is increased .
But when it decreases , the same happens to the same happens to the water .
In California the snow on the Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The backage is in crisis .
The predictions , like you read , are graves .
The growing growing is secure in the world leading to a remarkable increases .
The environmental disastern out of the environment are increased and without precedented .
Four times more numerous times in the last 30 years than previous 75 .
This is a whole thing that 's a whole sustainable .
If you look at it in the historic consequences .
In the last five years , we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look attention the East Pacific , from the Americas , to the Americas , to the west , and both the parts of the subcontinent , where there is a impoor of the oxygen in the ocean .
The major causes of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent of fossil fuels .
The oil is a problem , and coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And it proposed to build a lot of other central power .
But we 're seeing a change of direction .
These are annoullated projects in the last few years and some proposes of alternative versus .
Everything , there 's a politics in our country .
The coal of the coal and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year for promote coal , which is a clean obsimulation .
And that image I was going to do something --
I want to do the Nath Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion liters of coal gallons .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second biggest flow of scories in America .
It 's happened around the Nath .
The nature of the coal advertising of one of the coal industries was this .
Video : I mean , Frosty the carbon , it 's a happy , and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's going to grow our economy .
Frosty the carbon is and more and more publisher .
It 's about good price , adorable , and the workers maintaining the stypend-on .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest mineral societies is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : Sarce clearly clearly -- Al Gore , Nancy Peloges -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima has launched two campaiged .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Acore : At COLergy see we see climate change as a serious threat to our business .
So our priorities is to invest a big amount of money in a effort to a public amount of money to make it public .
Actually , coal is not sporous .
We think it 's clean also -- it 's also a good prophysical .
So not preocupats of climate change .
Let 's do it .
Video : Carbone , you 've heard a lot of it .
So let 's take a turn in a structure of the word of the clean .
Straordinary ! The car is a bit noise , but this is the sound of the technology of the clean .
The coal consumption is between the main global warming , but the remarkable technology , the coal technology that you see everything .
You look at a look , this is the technology of the clean clean technology .
Al Gore : Indeed , the positive alternative connects to the economic question and the national security .
Video : Look , America is in crisis ; the national security , the national security , the climate crisis .
The field that all of all : our dependence on fossil fuels , like coal and oil .
Now , there 's a new , a new , audace solution for used .
Repower America : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to put the America to work , make sure , and help us stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that you 're going to solve our problems .
Repower America . Scover more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Comvast : It 's about re-re-giving energy to America .
One of the fastest ways of door to get the dependence on the combustiable that they kill our planet .
What 's the future is here . I feel like , it 's just a new energy .
What about the number two : Noves investment for a bunch of work .
Coments : Repower America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old old African proverbial African says , " If you want to go fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Lear last year at TED phectors an introduction on the LHC .
And I promise to address you 're going to go back to how the car .
So , here I am . And for those that the other time there were no , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment never tried -- 27 miles of circuit .
His task is to remember the conditions that were under a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- until the second of the universe -- until the second .
All this is just environment .
This is the Ginevra under Ginevra .
We 've been photographed these mini-Bang inside the detectors .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- it 's large 44 meters and it has a 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions .
The 10 September year we have access the car for the first time .
And this photo taken by ATLAS .
It was caused to immense control in the control room .
It 's a picture of the first particles that had done all over the LHC , entering collision , to collision , with a part of the LHC , and spreading particles inside the LHC . And spreading particles inside the LHC .
In other words , when we saw that image 10 to September , we knew that the machine worked , which is a big victory .
I don 't know if it was this to make us more or more or this , when somebody went to Google and saw that the beginning was this .
That means that we had a cultural impact beyond that scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , had to these dorribs here -- these dorribs .
These files lead 13,000 amps when the car works at the machine works .
Now , the technicians between you will look at the kids and say , " It 's not true . I 'm too much subtle . "
And instead can do that because when they 're very cool the superconducts .
So at less 271 degrees , at the inferior at the time , these things can bring that corrate .
In one of the most of the nails of the nails in LHC , there was a floor of fectors .
So the floor of flightly , and the 13,000 amps of suddenly , they met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnets more than 20 tons , and that have moved on about 30 centimeters .
They are damaged about 50 magnetets .
We had to take them , what we have done .
We restined and adverted them .
Now , they 're all coming back to their place above .
I mean , the lead the LHC is is going to be again .
We 're going to accinept , and we expect to get to right now or June , and continue so our adventure to discover what the morning to find .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents remaining the debate on science and engineering in the valuable of science and engineering . It 's easy to be future .
I think that 's so difficult , the fact of going to go beyond the limitations of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a Ingan scientist , Humphrey Davy Davy Davy Davy Davy Davy , which is the inuseful experiments of his puppileasant Michael Faraday , said , " Nichael Faraday , said , " Nithing for the ideas , which is not very dangerous , and that we don 't have any worse for nature , and our trifloor of worldwide , and that we don 't have a connect .
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to rethink when kids , from kids , playing with the morning .
While you can reach them and take them and take them and take them and move , and learn to learn about problems and actually learn to think about problems and manipulating problems .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , as a information from our uslity of our interaction with physical objects , together to my consulting Pt , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking , " And if we use a computer , instead of the heads of the mouse as a digital crazy that is moving on a desktop of the digital pattern that is moving on a desktop information with both an information with both of both of the way with both of the hands ,
and sistemared to our floor ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer interactive like a big interactive computer .
In a few words , a Siftable computer interactive like a big interactive computer .
You can see them , you can see them , they can see , " between them , feel their movement and they have a radio and a radio .
But most of them are physical objects , like the morning , you can just move it .
Siftable information .
And as hand more physicists , conscious , of other people , and as they become more physicists , conscious as they become more physicists , of other , how we move , we can explore new and different styles of interaction .
I 'll start with some simple example .
This Sift-up is configurated to show that if it in a direction , the video is going to step like this , if you includes on the other side .
These interacts are achievement of other people .
If I face them , you 're interested in what they 're going to do .
If they 're surrounded , and they can see it and they can act a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , and they can see it and they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
And then I realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power of data , the communal gestures , for example , " to put " a color like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , configurated as a sitting , and I can use them to the color in that central , where they miss you misk .
and I can use them to put them in color in that central , where they missed .
If we 're too much , we can put a little bit of place .
They also are the possibility of learning , like languages , the mathematics and games where people can try and do things fast , and see the results of the extremely , and see the immediately results , and you 're immediately .
Now , I 'm --
This is a Fibonaces I do with a program of equations .
We have a game of words that 's half between Scarabean and Boggle .
And basically , at every turn a letter of case on every Siftable , at every turn , Pratically , at every turn a letter on every Siftable , and while circles , and while circles him to be control about a dictionary .
And then , after about 30 seconds , you have a new set of reading and new reading possibility to try .
Thank you .
So here 's children came to the Media Lab , I did so that they tried them and turned a video .
They were very much .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people a lot of educational instructions .
You 've got to say , " Compons of words , and they know exactly what to do .
So here 's how other people trying it .
This is our younger heads , on the right .
It really wanted to take them to impiling them .
They were only bring in the morning , for him .
Now , this is an interactive application of a cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of Lui is Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Siftable , they 're associated with them .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Siftable , they 're associated with them .
So it 's doing the sun .
Video : The Sun is sunlight .
David Merrill : Now brought a tractor in the scene .
Video : The arancient treator .
Blab ! Yeah .
So I school at Siftable and put them neighbors can make the characters ,
Video : Bau !
and in the story .
Video : I mean , I mean ,
DM : It 's a story with the open open open , and it can decide him how it comes .
DM : It 's a story with the open open open , and it can decide him how it comes .
Video : Video , throw .
DM : I 've got the last example I have the time to show you is a tool , realized , to walk and execececececk music .
It 's a tool , realized , to walk and execececk music .
The Siftable here are sound like based , based and bacteria .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also insert these sounds in a sequence to you do to do your floor .
And you just change it just doing it to touch a sound and a sequence .
These are effects that you can control from the way , like the reverbing and filter .
I mean , you know , to a particular sound and then includes to figure out .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , and volume , and it 's the whole sequence .
Let 's look like it works .
Video : DM : So we 're going to put a base in two Siftable , we 're going to a series , we add it into a series , we add other base .
Now I put a block line .
Video : DM : Now add to percussions --
Video : And I 'll put the filter to the bacteria , so I can control the effect of the alive .
Video : DM : I can quick the whole sequence of the whole sequence by a time or another .
Video : And I 'll add the filter to the floor to the flow to the filter .
Video : DM : I can recombined the flight .
So I don 't have to planning it first , but I can improvising it , realizing it longer .
And now , finally , I can spumbing the whole sequence inclining to the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new murder and more like machine and more like our own brain and more like our brain and corporate .
And today , I 've been time to show you one of the results of this performing , and also some possibility that we 're trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to spend is that it 's coming up with this new generation of designed objects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writing .
And I 'm writing books my profession , but it 's more than that , obviously .
It 's also love and love and the fascinating of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , I said that , something particular happened in my life and my career , and my career , who brought me the whole report of this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biograped called Manogy , Prega , Ama , Prega , so different from my previous books , for some reason , for some reason , and it became a big sensationship .
And the result is that everywhere goes now , people treating me as if I was convicted .
It 's true -- convicted , convicted ,
They 're going to me now all worried and they say , " You don 't have any more to do than we could do better than that ?
You don 't fear to keep writing for all life without power to be able to create a book that can important to somebody ? "
What do you do to be ?
It 's rassure , you know .
But it could go worse , and I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was an adolescent adolescent -- I wanted to be a writer .
I would go to meet the same reaction based by fear .
And people say , " Don 't temes I couldn 't do it ?
Don 't you fear that the humiliation of the refused ?
You don 't afraid to do this all life without any of it is nothing that 's ever outside and die on a cumulation of handing to a hyourself with the full of fallised to floor of failure ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I 've always been afraid .
And I also afraid of many other things that people could not have to guess .
As the alges and other things .
But , how about this is what I thought and wondered , and I was wondered , why is it ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that everyone is to be spended by a job that you feel like born to do .
But what is that 's so particularly in creative impress to make us nervous about health health . As a way other careers do not do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember a only in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he was afraid to be engineer ?
It wasn 't -- that block of the engineer John , how it ?
Don 't work like that , you know ?
Even , as chemicals like group don 't certainly , in the chemicals , they have the reputation of being alcohed .
We have a writers , we have enough this reputation , not only wrong with creative , but we have this reputation of being enormous instable mentally .
And I don 't think that look at the sad of the magnificent deaths of the magnificence that only in the 21st century , they died young and often for them .
And even those who are not sound surface to be really dissatisfied by their teons .
Norman Mailer , before he died , he said , " Every my book killed a little more . " Every my book has killed a little more . " A amazing affermation about work .
But we don 't buy while we feel that we heard these things so long that we 've heard these things that we 've completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way , and that the art , it will be able to be able to go to the ancient .
And the question I want to get everybody here today is : you 're agree with this idea ?
It 's good for you , because he looked at a himeter from a centimeter of distance me , it 's not good for anything about this .
I think it 's hate .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encourage our big creative minds to live .
And I know that , I know that , in my case -- would be very dangerous to start the way to the heart that I would have a little bit about supposed , especially date the circumstances in which I 'm in my career .
That 's really -- I 'm looking at , I 'm pretty young , I 've got about 40 years .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that anything write wrong about now , it 's going to be judged by the world as the work that came out after my last book .
I 'm slaved , because we 're all about friends here -- is likely to be that my greatest myself .
Oh , Gesus , who think .
You know this is the kind of thought that leads to one person to start beating a gin the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep going to keep doing this work that we love .
So , the question is , how do it ?
And so it seems after many reflections , that the way to work to work to keep write is to create a psychological costruction , OK ?
I have to find a security of security between me , which I 'm written , and my natural anxiety what is going to do . And as I was trying to go through the scale of how to do it began to look through the time , trying to find other societies to see if they could have the best ideas and more healthy ideas and more sane .
about how to help creative people manage to manage the emotional risks .
And that research me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
And I 'm going to do it , because it turns out to the circle and then goes back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit look divine and that came to men and that came to men from someone source and unknown , for distant distant reasons , for distant distant reasons and unknown .
The grew greenhouse gets were called the demand of creativity .
Socrate , wonderfully , he believed to have a demand that elargives wisdom .
The Romans were the same idea , but they called that a kind of spirit without a genius .
That 's great , because the Romans didn 't really think that a genius was someone particularly intelligent .
They have to think that a genius was a kind of entities that created lived in the walls of the study of a deal , a bit like the Dobby the elpho , and that came out of the Dobby , and that came out of the work and modeling the result of that work .
Except -- here 's the distance of which I talk -- that 's the distance of psychological that protects you from the results of your work .
And everybody knew that it was so that it worked , right ?
So , the anticies were protected by certain things , like , like too narcissism , right ?
If your work was exceptional work was not going to take all the deserate , everybody knew that was helped by this genius .
If your failed work , it wasn 't all your lift , right ?
Everybody knew that it was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people han conceived creativity in the West for a long time .
And then Renaisance came and everything changed , and it 's born this big idea ; we put the human being on the center of the universe all the mysteries and no longer and let no leaving space creatures that write .
This was the rational of the rational of humans , and people started to think that creativity came from the idividulptic .
And for the first time in history , he began to referre this or that artist like a rather than one with the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think that allow someone , simple person to believe like a recipent like a recipient like the source , the essence and the source of all my divines , creative , unknowable and ethernal responsibility to giving and a too big , to give us human psychches .
It 's like to ask somebody to put the sun .
It 's completely about the ego and creates all of these ingestifiable ingestifiable expectable on performance .
And I think it was this pressure that was destroyed the artists in the past 500 years .
And if that is true , and I think that 's the question is , and now it 's what ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of human relationship between human-mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't have 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there is probably people between the audience that would sold suspected suspected on the notion of the notion of , you know , you know , you know , they follow the things happen or made their projects .
I 'm probably not going to convined you all of this thing .
But the question I 'd like to get is -- why not ?
Why don 't you think that way ?
Because it 's more sense of everything that ever heard to explain the exasperformance of the creative process .
A process of what I 've ever ever ever tried to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- it doesn 't comprote rationally .
And in fact , sometimes , it can completely paranormal .
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poetesse Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but it was a poetesse for all life and told me that during the Virginia , he was working out in the Virginia , working out in the Virginia , and he felt it , in the field .
He said that it was like a fragorous air train .
And that was rotating to her from the landscape .
It was to be able to be , because he was so much of the earth under your feet .
He knew you had one thing to do about that point and it was , he was , he said , " corrates like a matter . "
And so it 's going to home and he wouldn 't have to make it more than making a piece of paper and a pretty fast , and a matter of paper and a matter of paper , while the trained , and I 'll take it and deal with it .
Sometimes he couldn 't be fast , so it 's so that it 's and running and poem and poem his rotles through and poetry her through and she would keep her on the landscape , and he would keep rotles through the landscape , looking for how she said , " one other poet . "
And then there were those times -- this piece of the time -- this is there were moments where it was almost losing it , OK ?
So , he was running at home and he was trying to paper and poetry her , and he was going through , and he was going to take a cause right in the while he was going , and then he said , he was like to sleep with the hand the step .
He wood offed the poem from the tail and he would put it in his body and transplyed it on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect , and it 's going to the last word .
So when I felt that -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly equal to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a connection .
I 'm a music , and my way to work is , and my way to work is ; wake up to the same horaries every day and go and go and go above it .
But even I 'm even in my head , I 've striped against that thing , sometimes .
And I think that many of you , also have a lot of you ,
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source I could not honestly .
And what is that ?
And how can we relate to it to do it , so we don 't do lose the head , but , rather , that makes us remain healthy ?
And as much about , the best example of the Tom Wait , which I 've been interviewed in Tom Waits , which I interviewed a different newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of the life of the artance of the artance of the crazy , trying to control , handed , to run these species of creative impulses totally interized .
But then I invent , he got calculus , and one day while he was driving on a floor in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
It was going to fast and all of a tract tract of major broke , that comes into his head as it does inspiration , elusive and training , and training it , and it wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and desidents , but not how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a math , it doesn 't have a register .
So , it begins to feel this kind of old anxiety to have grown in him like , and I 'll be able to lose it , and I 'll be obsessed by this song lost .
I 'm not enough , and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , he stopped .
It was going to be the whole mental process and made something completely new .
I just look at the sky and he said , " Do you see that I 'm driving ? "
" Are you can write a song now ?
If you really want to exists , you know , you know , when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , I go to important somebody today .
You go to disturbed Leonard Cohen . "
And his work is working process .
I don 't work , the work was still dark like .
But the process , and the fish that attornized was reef when the genius , the genius that causused him and further that was going to be able to do it back where it comes , we didn 't do it back from where it , he would not be an interized and remainly .
but it 's really amazing , wonderful bizarre , a collaboration between Tom and this strange thing and external , and it already that allowed it was not Tom .
So how I feel like that story started changing a little even where I worked and I worked , and already to save me a time .
This idea , I save when I was writing " Manogy , Prua , Ama , and falls in one of those cause disperation where we 're going to work on something and we don 't do it and we can 't start to be a disaster , which is going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst .
Not just the worst books , just the worst books .
And I started to think about gap this project .
But then I remembered Tom that was talking about air and I tried to do it .
So you get my face in the crowd and I made my commments to a vacuum , and I switch a vacuum .
And I said to high voices , " Sent , what do we know that if this is not going to be interacted in my , not going to be internal , right ?
Because as I see I 'm putting all I have , I don 't have that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to present you and make your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , I don 't do anything .
I 'm going to writing the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to make my part of the world today I 've been presented to do my part . " Because , it 's so , OK -- seced it does in the deserts of North people were raded for the middance of the middance of the middle of the mid-hour and music .
And they were always magnifices , because the ballerins were professionals and were fantastic .
But every while , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually .
And I know what I 'm talking about , because I know you all have seen , at some point , a performance like that .
It was like the time stopped , and the dancing walked through a kind of a bral walked through a kind of different kind of a huge , and it wasn 't doing anything different from the usually , but it was all sorts .
And all of a suddenly doesn 't appear like a human .
But it 's accurate from the divinside the fire of the divinity .
And when this was going on , the people knew what was , they called him .
They started saying , " Allah , they began to canting , " Allah , God , Allah , God . "
That 's God , you know .
I mean , the historic Chorical -- when Ms invading the southern Spain , I got this habitude with them and he changed in the centuries from " Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , " Olay , " Allah , " that you can still feel in the round or the floor .
In Spain , when a artist has made something impossible and magic , " Allah , words , words , Allah , magnificent , " incomprehensible , " incomprehensible , " God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But the problem comes the day after , the ballerin the dancing , when you wake up and discovering that are the 11 of Martedday and the morning of God is not .
It 's just a mortal with a bad with ginoccurred , and maybe never could go to that height .
And maybe no one will be the name of God still as it goes , and what has to do with his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most pain to make in creative life .
But perhaps not have to be so angosh , if you can 't believe , actually , if you can 't believe , the most extraordinary aspects of your being being from yourself .
But you just believe that they 're just going to be a further of this source of this source of the source of this squisite of your life that you 've finished .
And , you know , if we think about it all changes .
And so I started to think , and it 's certainly like this , I thought about for different months in the work of the book that I 'm going to publishing soon the dangerous , I 'm going to follow my gruate , I 'm going to follow my grandscape .
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel elected from this is , not afraid .
Don 't just go . It 's just your work .
It 's about the way , any way , any way , any way , you know ,
If your work is dancing , bad at the dancing .
If the divine , you know , you know , he assigned up decides to leave some kind of wonderful , for one moment through your effort , for one moment through your effort , "
Otherwise , you do the yourself .
And " Ole ! " to you .
I think , and I think it 's going to teach it .
" Ole ! " to yet the same , even for the human love and heads so much of human love and heads so that we 've got to make you continue .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And I 've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , what can meaning and discovery of new genes .
Now we 're starting a new way : we started to digitalize biology and now starting to start to digitalize biology , we 're entering a new phase of biology , designing and synthetic life .
We 've always been trying to get big questions .
What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists I think have tried to understand labels .
We tried different approaches , reduced to the terms .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to pass from the analog world in the digital world of computers .
Now we ask us : we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome that can autorem in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create one even smaller .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of the way .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple than our respect to our .
I think this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very unliving .
So we decided that the only way to progrew was synthetize this chromosome to be able to get the components to bring some of these things to get the fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " Can we synthetize a cromosome ? "
It can be the chemistry to produce these great molecules that we never have been able to create before ?
And in case , we can make a cromosome ?
A cromosome is simply a chemical of chemical material .
The speed that we 're able to digitalize life is growing to exponential .
And our ability to write the genetic code , instead , prodiscuss rather slowly , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results it on a exponential curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process required a lot of pass , starting with a bioetic review before we started .
But we found that that synthesize of DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines the world that produces are small segments of DNA , the longer of 30 to 50 readers and it 's a degenerative process : more the segment is longer , the segment is more errors .
So we had to develop a new method to assembly these fragments and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first trying to go from the digital information of the genome of Phi X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills kills .
We designed the fragments , effectively , and you get a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this chemical piece of the inhert material , and we put it into bacteria , bacteria have started to read this genetic code and product the viral particles .
The viral particles have been released by the cell , they 're back and destroyed the E. coli .
I 've talked about recently the oil industry said that they have certainly understood that they have certainly understood this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where software can actually build his hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things bigger in big big .
We wanted to build the whole cromosome of the bacteria .
I 'm over 580 miles reading genetic code .
So we thought I 'd build it in a seven of the viruses of the viruses , so that we can change the cassettes of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with information information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 , it was a mistake for every 10 miles .
We found , recently , 30 error . If we had the original sequence , we would never be able to be able to work .
One of the process is to design segments in 50 longer , which is to be overwhelming segments of 50 letters to build more smaller subunits of more than they work together .
We try to give the only one here .
You probably have read that we put on the physical physical .
Think it so : we have a genetic code based on four letters : A , G and Gs and T.
Three those readers put together codifed about 20 friendly 20 lots , and there is a specific order of reading for every adminoacide .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frages , thoughts .
What we did in the beginning of it was autograped .
Some of them were deluses of the fact that it wasn 't poetry .
We 've designed these segments to just just just to join with it .
There are enzing them and put them assime .
And we started assembly with the parts of the parts , beginning with five to segments from five to segments of the letters of 24 miles reading readers to them to be segments of the readers to get to 72 letter .
And we have made these abundance in abundance so that we can have to sequencing these sequency , we 're trying to create a very robustood -- you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems the tabellon a basket .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 thousand , more than 100 thousand , they 're not going to grow more directly in E. coli .
It comes to the modern limit of the modern biology .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination , which is in biology , which is using biology to repair the DNA can bring the DNA can join the segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , it can absorbed three million rad radiation .
You can see in the superior as his chromosome of the chromosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly like it was before .
They have thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms are completely .
They can live under a vacuum .
I 'm absolutely certainly life in space , and you mostly move to find new riching water .
And in fact , NASA showed that this is .
This is a imagine of the molecule that we 've built these processes , just using the least design segments .
The least assemble them , automatically .
This image was not taken with an electronic microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It 's a great molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are photos that they cover about six seconds .
This is the publishing we 've done very little time ago .
They 're over 580,000 readers of genetic code .
It 's the biggest molecule of a defined structure created by man .
It has a weight to 300 million .
If we stammed with a carround 10 without spaces , there would just like 142 pages to turn this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ?
Of course , you know , a virus is a guys .
It 's a bit more complicated when you use the bacteria .
It 's also simpler when it comes to ekarios as our eucarious as our : you can just extract the nucleus and put another , which is practically the clonation process .
In the archaea , the archaea is integrated inside the cell , but we 've recently demonstrated that we can make a bought of a bunch of a cell of a cell of a cell of a cell of a cell to another and activity .
We can refed a cromosome from a microbial species .
The two are different how men from the men .
We 've added some genes in more way that we could decide what to choose for this chromosome .
And then the slide with the ends in a way that we have to kill all proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was amazing -- and appreciate our sophisticatos -- the new cromosome went into the cell .
And we started thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we 've tried everywhere , we tried to spend us more .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that many species have added species have added a third or a second or cromosome of , add in a thousands of tracts of that species .
So who think about evolution as a only gene gene to evolution as a gene and it doesn 't understand a lot of biology .
And there is enzymes called re-restriition that actually actually put the DNA .
The cromosome that was in the cell of it doesn 't have one .
The cell phone that we put it out .
It 's expressed , and it recognized the other cromosome as the extremely material , and he was ritted with only the cell and the cell cell cell .
it 's blue because of the genes we put .
And in a short lass of time , all the characteristics of a species have gone , and it turned around a whole new species , based on the new species that we put in the cell .
All the proteins are changed , and they have changed , and when we read the genetic code exactly what we 've been transferred to what we 've transferred .
Now , this could look at genetic , but it 's high , you can actually get the software of DNA , we can change things in a pretty fundamental .
Now , I 've already explained that here is not talking about -- but progress to three million years and a half years of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's obvious when we think about our needs .
We 're going to spend from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right for give me example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 , there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , clean water and clean , medicinals and gets for six billion and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more hard to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion coal , more than 30 billion , more than 30 billion bets .
That means millions of bets a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to reduce them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep all the hemiddle of CO2 from these materials that ends in the atmosphere .
And so , in the day of the scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are designed for the future .
The electronics of the electronics only has about a dozen about a dozen of components , and think about how different things came out .
Our limitations here are very clear data here , from our imagination .
Now we have techniques , thanks to these rapid methods , that can create what we call fighting genomics .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million cromosomes that can produce a million cromosomes a day .
Think of this 20 million genes or different genes or to try to get the processes to produce either the processes to produce either , new vaccines , we can change , thank much , thank much much , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard standard .
We can choose for survival , chemical or or fuel , chemical or fuel , production of vaccines .
This is an instantaneous instantation of some software programmed to be able to seats and design species to the computer species .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
Now we 're now concentrating on the fuel of fourth generation .
You also have seen you that extract ethanol from the grate was a finished experiment .
We have a lot of second-third generation that will use enough to sugar fuel bigger than the bigger value of the higher than eightan or different kinds of butanle .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without more than the constantly food and limited the cosmic food and limited the limited it would be transforming CO2 in matter , so we 're working for design cells that we 're working for for design cells that can achieve cells that can achieve this purpose , and we think we can have the first generation in about 18 months .
The combined light with CO2 is a metodownstroke -- but in our discoveries all around the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2500 meters of the water temperature of the water .
They remetane the CO2 using molecular hydrogen molecular source .
We 're trying to figure out if we can meet the CO2 , which can easily be transmitted by the way , converting that CO2 in the fuel , to drive this process .
So , we think we could be able to grow what we could increase what the basic question of what is life is life . " And we compared -- we have the goal -- we have the goal of reduce the whole obic industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where you ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And we 're working for using the same way , we 're working to use the same way of creating vaccines .
You saw this year with the flu , we 're always back to a year and with a dollar in less when it comes to the fair .
I think that this can change building vaccines combinable in advaccines .
And this is how the future could start to look change , now , the tree of evolution , acceling the evolution with synthetic bacteria , archastic evolution , archy , and indeed , and indeed , and indeed , and indeed , and indeed , and indeed , and indeed , and indeed , and indeed , and indeed , and then finally cellumate the eucks .
We 're so much of the people .
Our goes is to do a long enough to try and do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'll show you , the most rapidly possible , some fundamental work , a new technology that we 've taken to the Microsoft in a year ago , it 's Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
It 's a place that you can interact is to local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
We 're seeing here here , so many gigabyte photos with a kind of photos and continuous speed , for a panoramic fast , disponing the images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big amount of information that we see , how big these collects are of data or images .
Most of them are digital photographs , but this is a scanning from Biblic of Congress , and reloved in the crowd of the Congress .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that 's limited the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , example , not data of not .
This is Dickens Dickens . Each colonna represents a chapter .
And to show you that it 's just about text and not images , we can do something like that , to really make something like that , to really make a real representation of the text , not a photo represent .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little electronic book .
I don 't consider it .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of The Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you really have to read the beautiful experience of reading the card version of a fire or a newspaper , or a newspaper , which is for nature a lot of half .
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of the Guardian .
We 've created a higher advertising advertising -- much more than you than that you use in a normal advertising -- and we put it in a normal advertising .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even the techniques .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the space .
We hope that that means to put the pop-up and other porks like the pop-up , and other porks like , they don 't need to be .
Of course , the mapping is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't say that we have contributed to give this a field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. .
So we go to something else .
This is now actually , in the web , you can go to the web ; you can see it .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research at Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve , a good good research .
And it 's from the Web , gested by Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of pattern , where we can go from a image to another and have this kind of experience , and have this kind of experiment .
But the space of the images of the images here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization of the computer have recorrespond to these images together , so that correspond to the real place in the recorrespond to the Grasis on Montagen Mounagen Roccious Dasis on Mounagne Roccious , they 're taken . So , you see elements of a slight-stable show , and these things are all space space .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to spend it to one of the original data of Noahhy-set of Noahytheld of Photosynthratic Photosynth that we 've done for the first time , the extent , to show you what 's really the key behind this technology , the technology Photosystems . And it 's not necessarily extent .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of the catthedral Dame of the Flickr . Baast digitar . Baast digitar . Baast digitar , you get images of the other campus and so on , other campus and so on . Each of these arancions , and so that 's discovery appearancions to this model .
So they 're all imagined by Flickr and they were all connected to this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this way simply simply .
You know , I 'd never thought I 'd never thought about end up working for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying to get this kind of accouncience here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different types of different kinds of photowers : from those phones to the professional SLR , a significant number of meaning , in this environment .
And if I can try to look for those strange more strange .
Many of they are block , etc .
Somewhere there is a number of photographs -- here .
This is a poster of Notre Dame recorrectly .
We can go from the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the entire memory of how it looks like the Earth , from visual view -- and connects all those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , more than the sum of the parts .
You have a whole model of the entire that emerges .
Think of this as a Stephen Lawler 's work in the Earth virtual Earth .
It 's something that growing up in complexity as you use , and the people that are going to be able to equally use .
Their pictures are sea with the pattern metapes .
If somebody is going to contract all these saying saying the name , my name photographs of Notre of Dimproviously , you know , you know , the kind of rich data , and I can use it as a point of the ingressed to immerging in that metaphs , using the photos to the space , and have a social experience of cross-moke cross-model of cross-moke .
Of course , a consequence of this is virtual models of all the interesting models of the land , collected , and it doesn 't just just as an aims from satellite images and satellite images and similar , but from the collective .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I 've got good ? What 's going to your software to do is that there is to a certain point in the next few years , all the photographs , all shared by everyone in the whole world will be practically connected together ?
BAA : Yeah . What it 's doing is basically discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , among images .
And it 's doing it in the content of the content of the content of the .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of semantic information that 's recurring a lot of these images have to be .
As when you make a research of images on the web , you 're going to get a photos and the web page has a lot of information about the images .
Now , what if that is happening if you connect to all your photos ?
So the amount of semantic interconnection and the amount of wealth that is really huge . It 's a classic classic classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the major pleases when you travels and one of the extremely nographics is the power of living between who has not forgoes in the wind , the people who have the past in the wind , the touch the rain , touch the piogged , the wind it in the wind leap .
Basti to think that 's the sciamani Jaguar travel even beyond the Via , or that the old Inuit is still colors to Himalayas , the good as in Himalayas , the buddists are still going to remember the rest of the Dharma , to remember the major of the anthropologists , and that the idea that the world we live in not exist sense , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our own own own own own own own stroped , so many generations ago .
And of course , we all share sharing tracts .
Everybody is born . Everybody project .
We 're subjects to start .
We have to deal with the inesorability of death , so you don 't surprise and therefore --
We all have an art .
What hits is the particular rhythm , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they are the Borneo 's Borneo , or the following Voooodoo Haiti or the warriers of the Kaisut , or the Kaisut , the Curandmeld of the Kenya , or a cammas .
He was my journey in the desert of a month ago , or a yak habit of the Qomolangerous , on the Everest , the mother of the world .
All these people teaching us that there are other ways of exists that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of modes in the world .
And if you think , you know , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
Insit together , the cultures of the world creating a spiritual life of the world , and cultural life that 's important for the benefits planet and is important for the well-being of the planet as the biological ragela as a biological ragela .
And you can think about this ragela of cultural as a a very etnosphere and you can define the som of all concepts , dreams , dreams , inspiring , ideas , inspiring , intuitions , ideas , intuitions , inspiring , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions ,
The etnosphere is the patrimonia of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how we can be in how to species .
And because the biosphere was a very large consumed as it was as much as it was in ethnosfurther and purban .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species was about the horrise of the simply extinction because it 's false , or -- in the most op-hypocalycical -- in the field of biological diversity -- and not already to be as much as optimistic as of cultural diversity .
The index of that is , obviously , the loss .
When you 're born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the spraw of human spirit .
It 's the middle of which the animal is comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a soft , a spiritual possibility .
And those 6,000 languages , while we 're sitting here to Monterey , at least half of the kids .
They don 't get to teach kids , which means , unless you walk , unless you wouldn 't be in .
What is more sad than being the silence of the silence , of being the last to talk to a language , not way to have a language , not way to transmit the wisdom of the promise of the promise of ?
This is the state of people in the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , a old old old old old old , and it 's a very ancient , the same way , the last syllabe of a ancient language .
And I know that somebody will say , " Isn 't that that ?
The world would not be better place if we talk all all the same language ? " Benism , then we talk all are yorba . We talk cantonese . It 's about cantonese .
Let 's talk kogs .
You 'll get a tratratratratraat what it means is not to talk about .
Today I 'd like to do a journey through the way --
a little journey in the ethnosh to give you a little bit of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of exists , " I mean , " I mean , " I mean , " I mean , " really different ways of existing .
Let 's take this baby Barasana , in Amazon , the anaconia , the people of anaconda , which credeal to come from the west river of the sacres of the sacred patents .
It 's a popular that it 's not able to distinguish the blue because it 's time it 's identified in the forest , where the forest , which depends the forest , which depends the forest .
They have a strange language and a rule , deted language , deted language , " You have to married a different language .
All this roots in the past , but the particular particularity is that in these exists , in these existed families where they talk about six or seven languages , no one practices .
They 're just to listen to listen to listen to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waorani Worani , the Worani Eastern East , a people who have the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have tried a comfortable contact .
They did take away from the photographed photographed them in a few people who thought that were adichevoles , forget that this popular popular forest that this popular popular pluvial .
They have collected the photos , they turned to research a shape or a figure and , not finished that it was that it was going to be hundred missionarious with the milance .
But the Waorani man only killed the strange .
They killed in their .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We 're high himself generations and found two of natural cases , and we found two of natural death and when we put it in , they admit to know , they admit , and then they died it , and then they kill it the same .
The cters were able to recognize the 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the first 1980s , I was assigned a very interesting task when my Harvard professor when my Harvard 's professor in the secret societies to the base me of Duvalier and the Tonton Macoues and the Tonton Macoutes and impossessing in the fast of Duvalier used to make zobird .
To make sense of miraced , I should have to understand the Vodoud culture and that Vooodoo is not magic .
It 's a pretty than complex metaphysical vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to say the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianism , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always let out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has not tracked religious . And he did not religious . And he did not have more than the distillness of these religious concepts that we have a lot profound religious concepts that we have to be slavery .
What 's interesting to the voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , you 're going to hire the spirits .
The spirits can be invited by the Great Acqua , they respond to the rhythm of the dance of the way that is that for a short of the way that for a short across the follow of the follow of the follow becomes the god .
So , the vooodooists love to say , " You go to ask God .
We say in the temple and forget God . "
And the time you are a time that you 're going to drive you , how can you make you the evil ?
So you see these incredible events : followed to voodoo in the state of trance that touch hundred infuel , a rather stronger demonstrate in the body that 's catalyzed in a state of extreme of extreme , when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme .
And all the people who lived the most amazing most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada , the Kogi . The Kogi , Santa Marta , in Colombia sectouched .
Deign old civilization that once had to the Colombic planning that was living on the planning of the Colombia in the attentist , the popular mainly running about the vulcanic massive planning .
In a macky continent blood , this popular continent , this was never conquered by the spages .
At today , they 're governed by a cler-city , but they 're really extraordinary .
The young people followed out of the family to the family to the family to three or four years , and they live in a good world and hombs in a good world and shadow in the basic for the ice of the ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , I 've been proposed to reproduce the nine months of gestation that spring in the usming of the mother , are now metaphorically in the Great Mother .
And so , so , so , they 're acculturated to their societies , values that they predict that their predicts and only their prayers maintaining the cosmic balance -- or to say the cosmic balance .
At the earthquake of this incredible began , suddenly brought out and for the first time in their life , at 18 years , they see a high . And in that account of the first cut , when the sun of the city , when the sun goes in beautiful landscape , everything that they 've learned theory is consterated in all of his splending . The pleased a step back , and says ,
" Would you do that ? I said .
It 's amazing . Now it 's to you protect it . "
They call the major brothers and they say that we , brothers , we are the colors of the destruction of the world .
This level is extremely important .
When we think about the ingene and the environment we 're invoking Redicseau and old story of the noble self-concept , which is a razy , or perhaps we have a razy concept in its simplicity or maybe we 're closer to the Earth of us .
The ingenes are not feed , not feed or unweight .
There is no space for these things in the malaria paluds of Aststered or in the gelids of the Tibet , but thank you for the time and they created a mystics of the Earth based on the concept of it , but on an unknowledge , the concept that the Earth can only live only because it 's infection .
What does it mean ?
It means that a kid of the Ande that grow is a boy of Apu who is a spirit . Apu who will drive his destiny different and will have a different report of the mountain or that place , and it 's going to be a different report , or that place , and it would say that a little bit of the Montana , which is a mountain mass mountain mass , and it 's going to be scaved .
which is the deal of one , or a mineral or a mineral is irrelevant .
What 's interesting , that 's the metaphor that defines the report between the natural and the world .
I grew up in the forests of the Columbia Britannica creding that forests served to be cut .
And that made me a human being a different of my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the Hukuk and the stories of the Hukuk and the stort of the paradise and the stories of the paradise and the dogs that live to the extremely north of the world , spirits .
If you look at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of their sensitive sensitive . We make this plants .
I 've taken this picture to open in the northern Amazon .
Mayahumpahumpahuh , the most powerful such as a bad repertoilet 's like the sciamanic repertoilet 's talk .
What 's what 's fascinating the ayahumpahumps is not the phemacological potential of the substance , but its respts . It 's taken two elements .
From a hand , this lead legacy that contains a series of betacarbolin , harmine , slightly hallucinogenes .
I mean , the only plant is plant , you have a blue that it 's a little bit of consciousness , but it 's misceled with the leaves of a family of the Psychotria .
This plant contains powerful plant , very similar to serotonin the methoxyptamine-methoxyptamines .
If you ever see the Yanomami , thoxyptami , they make from a different set of species , anched methoxyltryltryltryptamine .
And so , you 're going to be spared by a little bit like being disappeared by a fire of pyle , and landing up a wake of electricity . TRison 't create a destanding of the reality .
I often I often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who have taken the psychedelic , with his discovery of fungi in the ' 30 in Mexico .
I think my thesis , you can 't classify these triployed like trained because if you 're not telling any trained . And so , you can 't tell any of being tared . It can 't be hurt . It can 't be horally because they are money from a physically in the intestine , deted by the intestine monoaminossize .
It 's possible to absuit of just if you just have to other chemicals that money MAO .
Now it 's the beautiful : : the beta-carbolins that are inhibitors of MAO , the same kind of need to potential the triployed . The spontanem is to a 80,000 species of plants , like these people are doing these popular deaths , like these popular des , not that , but that if you combine in this way , create a biochemical version that is on the higher of parts ?
We use the great euphermism of evidence and error , which can unfruit .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " The plants talk . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of the ayahuasks , which are distingue , and that our eyes would be going to the forest in the same species .
If we ask them as they say , " I thought , " I thought I 'd like to tell us , " I thought about plants , you don 't know everything ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night of while , and each other will be cancer with a different .
With this doesn 't have lead to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting than to contate the stams .
Now , the problem is that also the people of us who have heart the indeed with the ingenes that are painting , but somehow reduced reduced in the history of the story to our real world , and pass beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it will not remembered for its wars or its innovations , but rather like the technology , we stopped and abbraced actively or accepted destruction of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All cultures through the secrowd in a dance for new life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Indians have no stopped being Sioux when they put out of the ark and flown as Americans don 't stop being Americans when they put from horse and became it out of the horse and calated .
It 's not the change or the technology that integrity of the integrity of ethnosphere .
The hard of the domination .
And if you look at the world , you 'll find that these aren 't cultures are cultures to disappeared .
They are creatures and dynamics out of identified existence from existence that are going to identify their own adaptation .
Which is that you have disboxing in the Patria --
a popular nomade of Sarak , in the southeast , a popular popular that lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to the servitch and prostitution on the record to the rive revolved of reflection , where you can see the river is a lifetime to the Merar Cinese Merneo Merian Cinese , where naves the high of navels ,
and you can fly stay the stock with the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that have come to the discovery of the gold .
If we move on the mountains of the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard of political domination .
As you know the genocide , physical extinction of a popular , is convicted to the universal , but the ethnocide , the destruction of the people 's lifestyle , not only is condanced , but it 's not just convicted , but it 's a near-development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet suffering of Tibet until you 're going to do .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China , in the Western China through the Southeast Tibet , coming to Lhasa with a young ages , but just came to Lhasa , I realized what 's behind is that we feel about .
6,000 sacres sacres in the dust and cenhing .
1.2 million people killed by the military of the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical to the Panchen Lama .
which means it was killed to the time of the Chinese invasion .
His the crowed with Santity during the display that he brought the people in Nepal .
His mother was impresoned and his color was recognize .
It 's been brought to hidden in the age of two years hidden under his gonna because it wouldn 't live without him .
The sister , who did the same , was put in reeducation .
One day , he walked up a day a square burant to the Mao and , for this transgression , was a bunch of seven years .
The Tibet of the Tibet can be insopurable , but the repair of the people is to tener .
And then , all of it reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the world of the monooothers or we want to acght the policed world in the policed ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he died , he said that his biggest fear , in our going to go to this love vision of the world , we 're not just going to see the whole game of human imagination , we 'll think about a game modality of human imagination , but one day we 'll be swake up from a sleep , and we 'll even have other possibility .
And it 's humiliating our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The Neolitical revolution , who gave us agriculture , which made us absolutely sucked us to the seed of the seed of the slerarching of the slerarchy of the slerarchy of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has 300 years .
That 's not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to all the challenges that we have to deal in millennia .
When these are sort of cultures of the world is asked what it means to be human , they say , they say with 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all realize the possibility of being what we are are : a consciously , which has to make all the people and all the people and all the garden giardes can truly transport .
I 've taken this photo the northern extremity of the island of Baffin , when I went to Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , Great , he telled the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The government canaw was not always kind of a people who were the Inuit and the 50s to stabilist our premise , we 've rhink them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , I 'm afraid all of his life , brought all his arms , and all its attitude .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't themselves themselves .
The sledges in the origin were made of cards .
The grandfather of this man didn 't intimise from the artic or the libraries .
It 's gathered away , it 's calculus , and it 's calculus in focused in their hand . When the focused to her hold them , they work with a bama .
It 's spred on the door of this crap of crap and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
He wasn 't the dog and created a brid , with the handwider , and it created a sled-, and it burned another dog and it 's disappeared on the bankey , hit .
We want to talk about cavarsely with nothing ? [ And that , in different ways , in different ways , and Apausi , the symbol of the resilience of the Inuit and all the people of the world .
In the open 1999 government government canaints redied to the total control of a bigger territory of the California and the Texas the Texas the Maybe together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's an independent terrible . They all connect the minerary resources .
One of a splendo for example of how a nation-state can remember with his people .
And finally , I think it 's pretty obvious at least who of us was in these zones of the planet , remote that they are not remote remote .
For somebody is house .
They represent sections of human imagination that are going to be at the high of these kids , like dreams of these kids , like dreams of these kids , becomes part of the geography , they become part of the geography switch .
And so , we have National Geographic we are convinced that politicians will never get to nothing .
We believe that polemiics --
[ Applauses ] not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Each month , our website . Each month 35 million visites .
156 countries transmitted our television canal .
Our re-literally later lights .
Our work is travel to bring our audience in a place of wonderful cultural place , and we have to find a wonderful cultural world , they will be huge , burbraced , they will be hug for the central reveation of the world : the meritself of the exists of the difference , and multicultural world . And we need to find a lifestyle in a multicultural world .
where the wisdom of all the people can contributing to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that hope , which I hope you 've heard other than you 've heard and evidence to me some connections , in fact , not nothing .
I want to start with what I call " the " officer dogma . "
The official dogma of what ?
The official dogests of all the Western industrial dogma , the official dogen : " If we want to massive as the citizens . " The way to do it is to massive the individual freedom . "
The reason is , from a hand , in fact that freezes is in itself a value , is precious , useful , useful for human beings .
And the other is that if we 're free , each of us can act for all of us to do everything that massive , we can do everything that massive , without any decided to us .
The way to massive way freedom is massive to be choicing the choice .
More people have , more choices , more people are free , and more is their freezes , the more is their well-being .
This , I think , it 's so deeply radical in society that no one would dream to doubt .
And it 's also deeply radical in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has been possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I 'm a simple note about condition .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditivests , without contate the 10 oil varieties of olive olive and 12 acetes that you can buy for you a huge number of constantly in the figure out that there 's an enormous number of your degree .
That 's what the supermarket .
And then you go to the electronics stereo to buy a stereo : CD , lector , lector , radio , the CD , radio , the priner .
And in this single negoties of electronics , there 's a big number of components .
We can do six and a half million different combination using the components that there are only in one .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Ather camps : the world of communications .
I once a child , you could get all get all of the phone services phone needs , they could be a bat that they were provided by mom Bell .
It was doing the phone , it wasn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , by the way , it was that the phone never break .
These days went .
Now , we have a variety of phones , especially in the phones .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , the middle of the nose , and the blue , and the baby .
If you don 't have seen it in the negoties under the negoties down , you 're going to be brought .
And what happens is that people go into the stick and do this question . And you know , what the answer is ? The answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the philosion of choices .
Assisting health : it doesn 't happen in the United States that you 're going to go from doctor and doctor to say .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , could we do . As , you could do . As it has these benefits and these risks " B has these benefits and these risks , " B has these benefits and these risks . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Dr. " What would I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , and B has these benefits and these benefits and these risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebate , " Dr. " if she was me , what would do ? "
And the doctor , " But I 'm not her . "
The result of the result of the malancing , expression that makes it seemed to look like a nice .
But it 's actually not that a move the weight and responsibility of making decisions that would tell something about doctor , to someone else that doesn 't know -- and almost certainly have no -- and so it 's not in ideal condition to take the patient .
There 's a huge marketing of pharmaceutical products , people like me and you , and you , that if you don 't think that any sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do they publishing them ?
The answer is that they want to doctor to ask them to do it .
Something that is fundamental as our identity is a question of choice , how you see in this vignize , like you see in this vision , " We don 't want to give kids . Sceat the right moment . " We don 't want to identity .
And we can reinvent us how many times you do .
That means that every morning , at the morning , you have to decide that kind of person wants to be .
I mean , the family and marriage , a time , a common perspective , a communal , unhappy everyone , it was that he was that he had the most soon as possible , and he started to make the most soon possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not even when , and not what to do after .
And all day , all of it 's really to play .
I teach very smart students , and I do less than a time .
And not because they 're bright now , not because they 're less diligent .
But why are they impensiered , I 'm asking , " Would I have to marry me or not ? I should do it now ?
" Would I be sent later ? I have to think about the career ? "
I 'm interrogative interrogative .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this implment doesn 't completely compassumption that above it and not get a good vote to my extent .
And they really have to do it . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl underpurposed to work every day , every day , every day , from every single day , every corner of the planet , except that from the Hotel Randolph .
And it 's a parently , and I won 't tell anybody what , where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this incredible freedom of choices we have about work ? It 's going to be doing , we keep decided , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing , with the cell phone in a pocket , the Blackberry in the other , and the notea , and the notea .
And even though they 're all spent , every minute that we see our son 's baby , we also ask , " I have to say , " I have to answer this called ? "
" I have to say this email ? I have to habulous this letter ? "
And even when the answer is no , " no , all this makes the experience of your child very different than that would be in other conditions .
So , whatever we look , little things , big things , big materials and the lifestyle , life is a question of choices .
The world was this : Oververversial , there were some possibility , but not all about this question of choice .
The world today looks like this : The dilemma is , " Is it something like , or negative ? "
The answer is , they 're going to be able to be .
The positive silated , we all know , so I 'm going to talk about negative those negative ones .
All this is all of two negative effects of people .
The first , paradoxally , is that produces instead of liberation .
With so many options between which choose to choose , becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you an example , a meaning : a study conduct on volunteer than the volunteer pension-f-psyches .
A colleague has access to the Vancils data , the gigantic societies of funding , with about a million clients in the imperved in 2,000 different companies .
What she found is that it 's every 10 solutions that are offered to more , the percentage of adesion , the adesion of two percent .
With 50 funding to the offers , there 's 10 percent of adesions than they are available only five ?
Because with 50 funds whose choose , is sick , it 's sick to decide , and the choice is remaining .
And to ask , and I still ask questions , questions , and questions , and of course , questions , and I never get .
You know that it doesn 't just mean that these workers are going to manguring food for dogs because they 're not money , it also , to say that the decision is so ostics that they 're also losing the funding of the complementary dator .
Not participating , they 're losing until five dollars for the year from work , which would be well dissed .
So , the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world like this .
" And finally , for eternity : ketchup , sensitionese ? "
You want to take the right decision , if it 's for the right decision , if it 's for eternity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the bottom , and neptiming the wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that if we can avoid the paralysis and make a choice , we 're less satisfied by the result of how we would be we have been with less options of what we would have to choose .
And that 's for different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditivests which choose , if you buy one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could make a different choice . And what 's going on is better . And what 's what 's going on is better . And what 's going on is that the alternative imagined us induce to be a lot of choice . And what 's going on is that the decision of that was tained by decision ,
And even when it was a good decision .
It 's choices , the easier is easy more than any detailable than any detailable .
And there is what economists is what economists call constood .
Dan Gilbert has asked very good for how the value we do things about things that we do with things about what we are compare them .
As the rest , when there are many options , you can actually represent the characteristics of the options of the options of the options that are chosen .
Here 's an example . I have all of them who are not New York .
But that 's what you probably think .
There 's this base pair to Hamptons .
a place of luxury .
It 's bears . It 's all about them . It 's all about them .
Nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , maledition , it 's Agotic . "
" All my neighbors to Manhattan is away . "
" I could talk about right in front of home . "
And it 's pass two weeks , from the idea that it 's losing -- every day -- the possibility of park to where it wants .
The constood is the expensive opportunity is what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And the more are the options that we have to look , the more the characteristics are going to be able to attract as constood .
Here 's another example .
This vignize us a lot of things .
It 's about living the moment , and maybe living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you do , you know , you 're going to do not do other .
The things that we don 't choose have so many attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : it 's growing growing expectations .
I tried to my skin beating a new couple of jeans .
It 's almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were just like , they bought them and burst them from besty , they were dissixed , just after having them a lot of times , and they started to go good .
So I went to buy a new couple when the old those old those old , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The commit said to me , " You want to do it , easphy , he wants to relaxed ? "
You want to do it with the certain or with the bottons ? "
" Do you want to do it ? "
" Sots them wants to be a long time ? Bule blah , blah .
I was saying , and after a while I was able to say , " I want the kind of like , " I want to say the kind of , " He didn 't know what it was , so for a time I tried all of eans , and then I came out of eans , and then I came out of the best jeans , and then I came out of the best jeans that I 've ever had .
It was the massive . I had got the whole choice , I got the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand that .
The reason I was worse is that with all the same choice , the myself that choices were altic , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was waiting for me . I wouldn 't expected anything about it when there was only one kind of 100 different , and when it was alized , 100 different , steps , at least one kind of had to be perfect .
What I had bought was good , but not perfect .
After I had compared that I was trying to what I was trying to insatisfied to the expectations .
The addition of options in the life of people 's life does not make the expectations that have respect to the options of the options itself .
And that will make less saying unless satisfaction , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing if you realize it .
Because if you know , you don 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth is more like this .
" And it was better when it was worse , " The reason that it was better when he was worse , it was that when he was worse was worse , it was even worse , you can meet to meet the surprised .
And the world we live in the world that we live -- opulents , industrialized citizens with the expectancy of perfeature -- the massive we can hope is that things are at the height .
You 've never been surprised because your expectations , my expectations , you have involved .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse expectations , " Yes , you want . "
I mean , small autobiographic moslightly -- which I 'm really sposed and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't have to do better , I didn 't have accounted .
But it 's not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of the comprate a couple of jeans , when you 're only that jeans of jeans is that when you don 't satisfacts , and you ask you , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? "
The world is responsible . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a lot of jeans , and you ask you who is the responsible , it 's altrees as cloced as a responsible for you .
You have been able to do better .
With hundreds of available variety , there are no scale .
So when people are decisions , even if the result is worth , they feel involved , they feel that they 're going to be .
And the last few years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- of this depression of depression is just that people have deludent experiences because the standards are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that colors are .
So the final result is that we 're better better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me reminds you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely not . It 's true . It 's not true .
There is no doubt that a little bit of choices is better than having it doesn 't have at all , but it doesn 't really have a lot of choices .
There 's a critical value , magical value . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been playing that we 've been playing from a piece of the level where it 's improve our life .
Now , from the political point of view -- I 've been an political point -- from political point of view , the political noced .
What all this is that allows all this choice in the industrial societies is the material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , and you know , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too much .
So the face I 'm talking about is a sick of modern excent of modern , remembered Western societies .
And what it does have to be the arrage and is this : Steve Levitt talked about how much those constomies and discoverage for whatever they are inuutile . It 's a spring of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendes , it 's not just inuseful .
I 'm switch to be .
They make it worse .
If a little bit of what we in our societies allows that were reversed to those people are afraid , they 're not going to be the improve , it would be improve , but also our our own .
This is what economists is what economists call a paretian improvement .
A redistribution of the income is good at all -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice , excess that it comes back us .
And to end , " Let 's go , you can become everything that you want , "
You know , people do you think , " What does that do you think , what does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get anything in a glass . "
" A castrated imagination , a limited view of the world --
and I 've interpret it so , at the beginning .
But then , think , instead , I realized that the fish knock .
Because the reality of the fact that if you eat the board , so that it 's all possible , " you don 't get the freedom . You get the paralysis . You get the paralysis .
If you break the bock so that all you can decreasuitous satisfaction .
You go to the paralysis , and you can reduce the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost of certainly too , maybe even for fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbolic sphere is a recipe for infection .
Thank you very much .
