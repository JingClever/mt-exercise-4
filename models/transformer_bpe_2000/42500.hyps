I showed this year I showed these slides to demonstrate that the glacial calots , which for almost three million years had the size of 48 million years had the United States continental , it 's recorded by 40 percent .
But this underunderestablishment the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice .
The Actica glacial calots is , in a sense , the clean heart of the global climate system .
You expanding it and winter , and you get summer .
The next slide is going to be a fast-one carlliant card on the last 25 years .
The ice perenced are signed in red .
You see , you get expanded to the blue .
That 's the ice in winter , which is in the winter , you know , summer .
You can see that the ice ice ice ice lost , five years or more , it 's like the blood , that 's like the blood , that 's like the blood , and that 's like the body .
In 25 years , it 's been like this .
This is a problem because the warming of the ice , the ice ice ice ice ice , where there are huge amount of coal , where there are huge amount of coal that , microbes are transformed in meter from the microbes .
I 'm going to do the totality of the atmospheric warming , that quantity could doubling , superty this point of not .
In some lams , in Alaska , the methane is already bolding on the water .
The professorous Katey Walter of Alaska of Alaska was brought a team in a team in .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You 're good . The question is if we 're going to be .
A reason is that this termal enables at the Greenland from the northern .
This is a remarkable record .
The brought him never had to get to levels .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the West Greenland .
If you want to know how you get the sea level of the sea level of ice , here 's where you get the sea .
These corrups are increasing fastly .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctartica , the biggest block of the planet .
The last month last month have clearly fastancient that the galance of the ice is in negative , and that Antarctarctica , which pogets on some islands , which is particularly fasting in the shelter .
Equital at six meters of the tacque , like Greenland .
On Himalayas , the biggest block of ice , you see new laghi , which few years ago were glaghi .
From percent of the world 's population will be clear water from the one to the melt .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the city of this city .
The down-increase .
But when you diminishes , the same happens to the same water .
In California , the snow on the Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The kils hycrisis .
The predictions , like you read , they 're free .
The growing growing growth in the world 's powerful increase incendes .
The environmental disasts are increasing a rate out of the normal and within precedented .
Four times more number of times in the last 30 years , I 've been respect 75 .
This is a whole thing that 's a whole sustainable .
If you look at it in the historical context , if they can see the consequences .
In the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look attention the Eastern Pacific , the Americas , the American , to the West , and on both the parts of the subcontinent , where there 's a radical impoverimpoor in the oceans .
The major cause of the global warming , and with deforestation , which is 20 percent of fossil fuel .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions , together at China .
And it was proposed to build many other central central central .
But we 're seeing a change of direction .
These are the annoullated projects in the last few years and some proposes of versus .
Every way , there 's a politics in our country .
The coal and the oil and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting carbon , which is a clean oxymer .
And I was swalked to something --
I 'm going to be in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion galls of carbon .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the bigger second flow of scories in America .
It 's happened around Christmas .
The nature of one of the coal industries was this .
Video : Shabit , Frosty , it 's a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abondant here in America , and it growing our economy .
Frosty carbon is and more and more and more clean .
It 's good price , adorable , and the workers are keeps .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest minary society is Massey Coal . This is his Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'm going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Peloone , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alliance for the Clima Protect Clima has launched two campaigns .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Atue : ALergy see the climate change as a threat to our business .
So our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a effort , in a effort to make public and confused to make public and confused to get public .
In fact , coal is not sporco .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good way , we can .
So not preoa preoa about climate change .
Let 's do it .
Video : Acce : Carbone , you 've heard about it .
So you get a turn in a turn in a label of the clean ,
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noiss , but this is the sound of the clean technology .
The coal consumption is between major cuts of the global warming , but the night technology of the clear that you see changes everything .
You look at a look . This is the hath odieral technology .
Al Gore : Indeed , the alternative alternative to economic question and at the national security .
Video : Lownership : The America is in the crisis , the national security , the climate crisis .
The row that all of us : our dependence on fossil fuels , like the midddle and oil imported .
Now , there 's a new audace , there 's a new , cars solution for it .
Repower America : 100 percent clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to get America to work , make us more safe , and to help us stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that you would have to solve our problems .
Repower America . You cover more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's about re-giving energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to get to the dependence on combustiable that they kill our planet .
What the future is here . Vent is here . I mean , only a new energy network .
What you can do about two : New Two investment for a bad job .
Commtion : Repower America . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old African an Jore : If you want to go fast , you go to the fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We need to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
I 'm going to go at TED fecklies an introduction in the LHC .
And I promise to figure out to figure out you about how the machine works .
So here I am . And for those that time there were no , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever -- 27 kilometers of circuit .
His task is to remember the conditions that were less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
This is just environment .
This is the Ginevra under Ginevra .
We picture these mini-Bang Bang Bang in the relativels .
This is what I work on . This is called ATLATLATLAS -- is a large 44 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building , so you can see the proportions .
Ten September 10 of the last year we have accesus , the machine .
And this picture was taken by ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS .
It was causes to immense festery in the control room .
It 's a picture of the first particles that had all done the turn of the LHC , both in collision , and it spreading particles in the LHC , and spreading particles in the raising .
In other words , when we see that the image 10 to September , we found that the machine worked , which is a great win .
I don 't know if this to get us more or more or this , when somebody went to Google and saw that the initial page was this .
That means we have a cultural impact beyond that scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , just to these things here -- these dored dams .
These files leave 13,000 amps when the machine works at the power of the power .
Now , the technicians in the tells and say , " It 's not true . I 'm too sound . I 'm too sound . "
And they can do that because when they 're very cold , they 're very cool superconditions .
So , at less 271 degrees , at less , at a lower temperature to that of the space between the stars , these falls can bring that body .
In one of the fabulous among the magnetic networks in the LHC , there was a fabrication of fabbrication .
So the files are warming slightly , and the 13,000 amps suddenly , they met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnets more than 20 tons , and that they moved about 30 centimeters .
They 're damaged about 50 magnetic .
We had to take them , what we had to do .
We 've restined them and adjusted .
They 're going to go back to their place underground .
And it 's the end of the LHC will be again integry .
We 're going to accenept , and we expect to july the data to july , and we 're going to go so our adventure to find out what the morning is universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents reaches the debate on the value of science and engineering in front of science and engineering . It 's easy to be .
I think that the fact that it 's so difficult , the fact of going beyond the limitations of things like the LHC .
I 'd like to end with the words of a Ingan scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I imagine , in defense of the experiments of his puple , Michael Faraday , " Nothing is as dangerous for the progression of the human mind as a remarkable to the ideas of science are definitely , that there are no mists , and there are no mists , and that 's not in the trify of science , and there are not to be a new way to be . "
Thank you .
I want to start with you to think about how to kids , you 're playing with kids , you 're playing with the morning .
And as you get them and you can get them and get them , and you can learn them and get them and get them , and you learn to think and solve problems and manipulating relationships .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , as we have information from our uses of our interaction with physical objects , with my consulting Patti , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking : And if we use a computer , instead of having the only cursor of the mouse as a digital car that moves a descle of the polar , and we could demand with the hands .
and we sistemle to our plenty ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a big computer interactive as a bioftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a big computer interactive as a bioftable .
You can move them with your hand , they can see , you know , " in them , " to hear their movement and a radio screen .
But most of them are physical objects , like the morning , you can just move them just just to square .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physical , you 're conscious , of the other , and as they become more physical , conscious , of the other , of how we move , of the other , of how we move , we can explore new and fun interaccounts .
I 'll start with some simple example .
This Sift-hyourself to show the video : if you including it in a direction , the video wheel , if you including on the other side .
These interactive rats are aware of others .
If you 're saying , you 're interested in what they 're around .
If you 're surrounded , and they can act a bit .
If you 're surrounded , and they can act a bit .
They have their movement and inclination .
And then I realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the data , for example , " to put " a color like a color like it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , we have three Siftable , and I can use them to put them in the color in that central , where you mix .
and I can use them to fall of them to the central , where you mix .
If we 're too much , we can put a little bit to be .
There are also beautiful possibility of learning , like languages , the mathematics and games where people can provide things fast , and you see the results of the results of it .
Now , I 'm --
This is a Fibonaces that I do with a equation program .
Here we have a game of words that half in Scarabeo and Boggle .
And basically , at every turn , you get a letter on every turn to every Siftable , Pratically , at every turn a letter on every turn to every turn on a diond , and while you 're looking for him on a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you get a new set of letters and new chance to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came in the Media Lab , I did it so that they tried them and made it a video .
They 're very much fliid .
And one of the interesting things about this application is that you have to give people a lot of education .
You have to say , " You know , " I mean , " You know , " We know exactly what to do .
Here 's how other people that try it .
This is our younger header header , there on the right .
It actually wanted to just join them .
They were only brans , for him .
Now , this is a cardboard application .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning languages .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Siftable , you can get them .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Siftable , you can get them .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is .
David Merrill : Now brought a traor in the scene .
Video : The Aanange treator .
By work ! Yeah !
So I school the Siftable and putting them close to interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing their own story .
Video : Hoo !
DM : It 's a story with an open final story , and it can decide him how it comes .
DM : It 's a story with an open final story , and it can decide him how it comes .
Video : Voly , cat .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you a tool , realized , realized , to walk and exective music .
It 's a tool , realized , to wild and execting music .
Siftable here act sound here like bass , based and the battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose to use .
You can also get these sounds to get these sounds to beat these sounds .
And you just change it just doing it a sound and a sequence .
These are effects that you can control from the vive , like the reverbs and filter .
I would attack to a particular sound and then including it .
And then there are the effects as time and volume , and it turns out to the whole sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : DM : DM : We 're going to put a base in two Siftable " sequence , we 're going to address it , we add other base .
I 'm going to put a line of a bottom .
Video : DM : DM : Now I add percussion --
Video : And I 'm going to put the filter of the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the alive .
Video : DM : DM : I can fast the whole sequence by one side .
Video : And I 'll just just give the filter to the founder to expression .
Video : DM : I can I can fight the sequence " to fall . "
So I don 't have to plane it first , but I can improvising it , longer .
And now , finally , I can move the whole sequence and the whole sequence inclining to the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is build new interface , and more like the machine and more like how our brain work .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this way , and also some chance that we 're trying to bring out from the lab .
The concept that I want to turn is that we 're coming this new generation of projects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writer .
I guess books is my profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and the fascine of my life .
And I don 't expect that can change .
But , I said this , something particular happened in my life and in my own career , who brought me the entire report to report that job .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called " Mangan , Prega , Ama , " which , which , fun from my previous books , for some reason I used in the world and becomes a great sensational , and became a big sensational .
And the result is that everywhere go , people treat me as they were convicted .
Davetrue -- convicted , convicted .
They 're all worried about me and now , and they say , " Don 't have any fear of you not to be able to do better ?
You don 't fear to continue to write for the whole life without being able to create a book that can important to somebody ? "
that can important someone ? "
It 's remarkable , you know .
But it could go worse , except that I remember more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a teenager -- I was a writer .
I walked or meeting the same reaction as the fear .
And people said , " Don 't do themes I don 't have succeeded ?
Don 't you fear that humiliation of the refy refy killed ?
You don 't fear of the willing to be able to get this whole life without that nothing ever out and out of it 's going to get a dreams of fallide with the dinner , with the holding of fallide ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I 've always had afraid .
And I also afraid of many other things that people could not have .
As the alaxe and other things .
But , as I think , as I was to write about it what I thought and wondered is why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anybody who 's expected to be spavented by a job that you can do .
But what 's there 's so particular in the impress to make us nervous to make us nervous to make us nervous health of other way , don 't do ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember a only in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if she fear to be engineer ?
Wasn 't it -- that block of the John engineer , how do it ?
Dasn 't that work like that , you know ?
Onestery , the chemicals like group don 't certainly have , in the centuries , driven the reputation of being handed .
We have enough , we have enough this reputation , and not only writers , but creative any of all that we have this reputation of being huge , mentally .
And it 's not more than watch the sad of the deaths of the magnificent deaths , only in the venth century , they die and often their hands .
And the ones that are not suician seemed to be actually under their teens .
Norman Mailer , before you die , in the last interview said , " Every my book killed me a little more . " Every my book killed me a little more . " A extraordinary stermation . "
But we don 't buy bad blood when we feel that because we 've heard these things that we 've heard these things that we 've completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way , and that art , at eventually , will produce and rate .
And the question I want to bring all here today is : you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , this is you 're in here today : you know , you know , you know , this is you 're here .
You 're good this thing -- because it 's also watching it from a centimeter distance to me , not good at all this suppose .
I think it 's hath .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encourage our big creative minds .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- in my case , it would be very dangerous to start at the end of the way , especially , but you give the circumstances in my career .
And that 's what you look , they 're quite young , I 've got about 40 years old .
I have still about four decades in me .
And it 's very likely that whatever I write about now , and then it will be juddged by the world as a work that I was going to be able to my last book .
I 'm going to be slaughter , because we 're all more or less .
Oh , Geeeeeephysical thought .
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start drinking a person to start drink and I don 't want to do it .
I would rather to keep doing this work that we love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems , after many reflections , that the way to work to keep write is to create a psychologic cousts , OK ?
I have to find a security of security between me , which I 'm write , and my natural anxiety on which reaction will get . And as I was trying to all last year , trying to find other society to see if they could have other society to see if they could have some society to see if they could have more ideas and more healthane .
about how to help people create creative people to manage the inherent the emotional inherent creativity .
And that research brought me to the ancient Grece and ancient Rome .
Seguitem because it turns out to the circle and then back .
In the ancient Grecia and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit look at divine and it was to be that men from a few source and unknown , for reasons , for reasons and unknown .
The greening creativine called the spirits of creativity " demons . "
Socr, wonderfully , he believed to have a demone that elarging wisdom .
Romans were the same idea , but they call that spirit without a genius .
And that 's great , because the Romans wasn 't really thought that a genius was a very clever .
They had to be genius to be this kind of entities that created living in literally in the walls of a artist , a bit like the elfo Dobby , and that came out to see , and that came out to hidden the work of artist and ple the result of that work .
Except -- here 's the distance of which I talk about -- that 's the psychological that protect you from your work .
And everybody knew that it was that it 's like , right ?
So the anti-car artists were protects from certain things , like the too narcisixm , right ?
If your work was exceptional work was not going to take all the deserve , everybody knew that you were helped by this genius .
If your failure , it wasn 't all your own , right ?
They all knew that was your genius to be a hunable .
And so people have concept creativity in the West for a long time .
Then the Renaisance came and everything changed , and it was born this big idea ; we put the human being in the mists of the universe over the universe , and no longer leaving space creatures that write from divinity .
This was the rational of humanity . And people started to think that creativity came to the creativity came to the ight .
And for the first time in history , I started to refer to this or that artist as a rather than a person with a person .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think that allow somebody , a simple person to believe , like a recient like the source , the source of all of my divines , creative , inconscious and ethernal responsibility to a lot of humans too big to give to the fragile humans .
It 's like to ask somebody to stick the sun .
Deform and distores the whole ego and creates all these ingestilibs of the performance .
And I think it was this pressure that was destroyed the artists in the past 500 years .
And if that 's true , and I think that 's the question is , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and misty .
Or maybe it 's not .
Maybe we can 't sell 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And probably there 's people in the audience that would be released to scientific subjects on the notion of , you know , you know , you know , people who are going on or failures , or spapers .
I 'm probably not going to convinced you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to bring is -- why isn 't it ?
Why don 't think about that way ?
Because it 's more sense of everything that ever heard to explain the exasperformance of the creative impreveilability of the creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever trial to do something -- so , all of course , all here -- you know , you don 't understand rationally .
And in fact , it can sometimes it seems totally paranormal .
I did this meeting recently with the extraordinary poetetesis , and now it 's 90 years , but that was a poetetesis for all life and told me that during the rural childhood in the Virginia , and she heard it , in the field , and it was in the field in the world , and he heart it , in the middle .
And he told me that it was like a fragorous air train .
And that was rotling to her from the landscape .
It was to come , because it was to take the earth under his feet .
He knew to have one thing to do at that point and it was of , and she was , " run like a matta . "
And so it goes to the house and came to this poetry , and it would not have to make a piece of paper and a match , and a match a match , and he would raise it and saddress and sacking it on the page .
Sometimes he couldn 't be fast fast , and it would go into the house and run without management and poetry her through and poetry her , and she would keep it to go through the landscape , and she would keep rotles through the landscape , and he would keep it to saying , " another poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece of the time , I will never forget it -- there were moments where it was almost losing it , OK ?
So , she was running at home and he was trying to the paper and poetry her through , and he was going to sleep in a match just in the while he was going , and then he said , that she was like to sleep with the other hand and and the step .
And he was going to the poem from the tail and reput it in his body and transply-page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect , and it 's intact , but on the last word .
So when you feel that -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly equal , it 's exactly the same as I thought .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a mule , and my way to work is , and my way to wake up to the same orary at the same orary day and sweet and get work and pass you really enjoy .
But even I have , in my heads , I have stripped against that thing , sometimes .
And I guess that many of you , you know it , many of you , it 's going to be .
You know , even if the work and the ideas were given to me from a certain source , I could not honestly know .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we get to it to be able to make us us us , but , rather , rather , that do , that do , how do you get it yourself ?
As I think about , the best example , the contemporary example I have is the Tom Waits , which I interviewed a different year .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of the life has been the incarnation of the artist moment of the artance , trying to control , to manage , to manage , dominate these species of impulses totally interized interized .
But then I invest , he gave , and he was driving on a driving of a driving in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going to fast and all of a sent traits , this little broadness of melody , which is coming in his head as an inspiration , and it wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and it wants , but not as you know .
It doesn 't have a piece of paper , has no matine , it doesn 't have a die .
So it starts to hear this sort of old anxiety growing in him , " I 'm going to lose it , and I 'm going to lose it , and I 'll remain the song .
I 'm not enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic ,
And he was going to make the whole mental process and made something completely new .
I just look at the sky and he said , " Don 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" It looks like to write a song han han hour ? "
If you really want to have to be back in a more opposer moment when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you go to important somebody else today .
You go to disturban Leonard Cohen . "
And his work changed later , he changed after this .
I don 't work , the work was still as well as always .
But the process , and the weight-handle anxiety , the genius who was taking it , the genius who out of him that problems and liberated it remaintain it from where it was , remained that he didn 't have to be an interior , and tormented .
but blind this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration in Tom and this strange thing that strange and external thing that was not Tom .
So , as the story started changing a little bit , even the way I worked and already to save me a time .
This idea , I was saved when I was writing " Mange , " Ama , " and fall in one of those cave disperation where we all cave when we 're working on something and we can 't and we can 't and we can start thinking that it will be a disaster , which is going to be the worst book , or ever ,
Not just just bad , just the worst book ,
And I started to think about gone this project .
But then I remembered Tom that was talking about air and I tried to it .
So I raise my face in the manubuts and I resses my commments to a vacuum of the room .
And I said it high , " You know , what do we both know that if this not going to be brilliant book , not will be interacted my , right ?
Because as I see it all I have , I 'm putting all of this .
So if you want to be better , you have to present you and make your part .
OK . But if you don 't know what , I don 't know about it .
I 'll just give you to write the same because it 's my work .
And I would like to make it a hours that I 've been presented to do my part . " Because -- at the end is like this , OK -- centuries ago in North Africa 's deserts people would sell for damances to the clear of the midddle of the middle of the middle of hours and hours .
And they were always magnificent , because the ballers were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every once , something happened , and something happened , and one of these artists became actually .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you all have seen it at a certain point , a performance like that .
It was like the time stops , and the dance dance ballery , and it was not doing anything different from the usually , like 1,000 nights before , but all fun up .
And suddenly , you don 't look like a human .
But you accen from the divinside and below the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , at the time , people knew what was , they call it with her name .
They were congestation and they started cantanks , " Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , God . "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note -- when More invads the Spain , the Spain , there was this habitude with them and the pronounce of " Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , " , " " You can still hear , " that you can hear in the short or the fend .
In Spain , when an artist has made something impossible and magic , " Allah , " " Allah , " " " Bh , " I 'm going to be a wild , " incomprehensible , " Lek .
And it 's great because we need it .
But the problem is coming the danceror , the dancerce wake up and discover that they are the 11 in Martedyes and discover that 's the 11 morning of Martedyes and gets God is not there .
It 's just a death with the knea with the kney of the knea , and maybe it 's not going to be able to get that altitude .
And maybe none will be the name of God still as it turns , and so what has to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most pain to make a creative life .
But maybe it has to be so angot-to be so angoscious if you can 't believe , lung , the most extraordinary aspects of your being from yourself .
But you just believe that you have to be a prested by a unimaginable source of this source part of your life that you have to get somebody else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think about it this way all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly like it , and it 's as I thought , for a different works that I will publishing soon , and I 'm going to get a dangerous , followed , and I 'm going to be followed in my great success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel elected by this is , not having to be afraid .
You don 't ray . It 's only your work .
It 's a way to you , any way , any way , you know , any way ,
If your work is dancing , balls .
If the divine , you can light-assurd you to give some kind of wonderful , for one moment through your effort , just just through your effort , then " Ole ! "
Otherwise , you do the same dance .
And " Ole ! " " You know it . "
I think and I think , and I think you have to teach it .
" You ! " at yourself , even for himself , but it 's just for having love and heads that you can get you to get you to keep you to get you to present continually .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
You know , I talked about some of these projects on the human genome , about what it can mean and the discovery of new genes .
We 're starting a new way : We started digitalizing biology and now from that digital code we 're going to go into a new biology , design and synthetizing and synthetizing life .
We 've always tried to get big questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists , I think have tried to understand lifs .
We tried different approaches , reduced it to the terms .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to pass from the analog world of the computer in the digital world .
Now we ask ourselves : Can we can regenerate life , or create new from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest genome that they can autorem in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the ulter-genome to create a smaller even smaller .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of the way I 'm here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple to our .
I mean , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at a time , it 's very improbable that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to progreen-synthesize this cromosome to get the components to bring the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " Can we can synthesize a cromosome ? "
Can you have the chemistry to produce these big molecules that we never have to create before ?
And in case , we can make a cromosome of a cromosome ?
A cromosome is simply a chemical of inert material .
The speed that we 're able to digitalize life is growing exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead of procrete , rather slowly , but it 's getting getting it .
And our most recent results of it bring it on a exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process require a lot of pass , starting with a bioetic review before we started the first experiments .
But we found that DNA synthesize that DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that produces small segments of DNA , of the longer , 30 to 50 letter , and it 's a degenerative process : more error segment is , more error .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these fragments and run the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , starting to start digital information from the genome of Phi X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills that kills .
We designed the fragments , actually , the correction of mistakes and get a molecule of DNA , about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material inert and we put it in the bacteria , and we put it into the bacteria , and we produce the viral code and product the viral particles .
The viral particles have been releft from the cells , are back and they destroyed the E. coli .
I talked about recently with membranes of the oil industry , which they certainly understood this model .
They repair more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build its own harddware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things bigger .
We wanted to build the whole battery chromosome of the bacteria .
I 'm over 580 miles of genetic code .
So we thought we 've thought to build it in seven of the virus of the virus , so that we can change the seven to understand what the components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these are to be very accurate .
When we sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard accuration was a mile for every 10 miles .
We found , recently , refence it , 30 mistakes . If we used that original sequence , we would never be able to do it work .
One part of the process is designing 50 longer segments that are overlap to all the other segments of 50 letters to build subunits of more small , working together .
We try to give one unique elements here .
You 've probably got a bad that we put on the side of the strange .
Think of it , we have a genetic code based on four letters : A , Cs , and T.
Three of those letters together codify about 20 minoacids , and there 's a specific order to each amminoacid .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frages , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was going to do .
Some of them were delivered that it wasn 't .
We designed these segments to just just join them to join them .
There are enzymes that reputs them and put them assime .
And we started assembling to the parts , starting with five to segments from five to seven miles , to segment of 24 miles , and they 're going to get 72 though , and the letter to get 72 thousand letters .
We 've made these segments in abundance , so we have these segments in abundance , so we 're trying to create a very robustood -- you 'll see in a minute .
We 're looking for authomatizing the process .
So , this seems like the tabellon of a basket .
When we get these very long segments , more than 100 miles , more than 100 miles , they will not grow more directly in the Elli .
You get to the modern limit of the molecular biology .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination , which in biology that in biology can use to repurpose DNA , that 's able to join the DNA that can join the segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , it can absorbs three million rads of radiation .
You can see the superior as a requarter as his chromosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly like before .
There 's thousands of organisms that are able to do .
These organisms can be completely .
They can live under empty .
They 're absolutely certain that life exists is in space , and you can get new water environments .
In fact , NASA showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built by using these processes , just using the least , the least design of the segment .
The yeast assemble to the automatically .
This image was not taken with a microscope with an electronic microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It 's a great molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that cover a time of about six seconds .
This is the publication we 've done a long time ago .
They 're over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined structure that man ever .
It 's got a molecular superior at 300 million .
If we stamp it with a 10 within a character 10 within spaces , it would like 142 pages only to turn this genetic code .
Now , how do we make it ? How do we get it ?
Of course , you have a virus is a guy game .
It 's a little more complicated when you use the bacteria .
It 's more simpler when it 's eucarious as eucarious cells as our : You can just extract the nucleus and put another , which is basically the cloning process .
In the battery archaea , the chromosome is instead of integrated inside the cell , but we 've recently recently a cell chromosome from one cell to another and activity .
We had a cromosome with a microbial species .
The two are different how men from men .
We have added some gene that we could decide what to choose for this chromosome .
And then he skip with the enzyme , and it 's going to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was study -- and you 'll appreciate our sophisticatooes -- the new cromosome , the new cell cell .
And we were we thought that we could not go beyond , but we 've tried to spinning us in there .
This is one of the greater mechanisms of evolution .
We found that many species have added species have to a third or a third cromosome of new tracks , in a hundred new tracts to that species .
So who thinks evolution as only as a only gene to evolution , you know , a lot of biology .
There are enzymes called restriction enzymes that adjumption are that digery digest-DNA .
The cromosome that was in the cells , you know .
The cell phone that we 've inseritous .
It 's expressed , and recognized the other chromosome as extended material , and we were returned to the mosome , and we found it with only the cell and the new cromosome .
It became blue because of the genes we 've put .
And in a short time , all the characteristics of a species went along , and it turned to all in a new species , based on the new species , based on the new software that we put in the cell .
All the proteins are , and the member , and when we read the equivalent of the equival code exactly what we 've done .
Now , this could look like genetics , but by altering the software , but by altering the software , we can change things in the way .
Now , I 've explained that you don 't talk about genesis -- but it 's progress to three million years and a half years of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion that will come to be created new species on this digital .
Why do that ?
I think it 's obvious when we think about our necessities .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people to nine billion in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
There are three people on the planet for each existing each existing in 1946 ; there 's four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean and clean and gets for six billion and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more tough to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , over 30 billion carbon , over 30 billion bets of oil .
That means 100 million bariles a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to reduce them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole emission of CO2 from these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
And today , thank you with scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a databases with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they are the designed for the future .
The electronics industry only has a dozen about a dozen of components , and think about how many different things came out .
Our limitations here are practice and our imagination .
We have techniques , thanks to these rapids of synthesization , that can create what we call combinatory genomics .
We 're able to build a big robots that can produce a million cromosomes a day .
Think of these 20 million genes or different genes or to try to get the processes to produce either the pharmacoo , and new vaccines , and we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , production chemical or or fuel , fuel vaccines , production of vaccines .
This is an instantaneous instantaneous instantly of some software programmed to be able to sit and design species to the computer .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
We 're focusing on the fuel of fourth generation .
You also saw you that extract ethanol from the grant , it was a finished experiment .
We have secondly , and third generation that 's going to be soon the higher than value to be higher value or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way biology can have a big impact without increases the cost of food and limitation and limitation it would be to transforming CO2 in matter , so we 're working on to design cells that we 're working for designing cells that can achieve this purpose , and we think we can get the first carbon as a way as a generation in about 18 months .
The solar light with CO2 is a metodown-like , but in our discoveries around the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2500 feet of depth , at the temperature of water .
They reat the CO2 using molecular hydrogen , like energy .
We 're trying to figure out whether we can clear the CO2 , which can easily be transported by the tubes , converting that CO2 in the way , to drive this process .
So we think that we could be able to increase what the basic question is , " which is life . " What is life " is Nice , " We have the reversion -- we have the modity of reducing the whole world . "
You know , if you can 't do it from TED , where can you ?
It would be a main energy source .
And we 're working on the same way , we 're working for using the same metods to create vaccines .
You 've seen this year with the influence , we 're always back in a year and a dollar under when it 's a year it 's a cool .
I think that you can change by building vaccines combines in anticipate .
Here 's how the future could start to look at change , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating the synthetic evolution with synthetic bacteria , archaeucarious .
We 're all so on the best people .
Our purpose is to do a long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
So , I 'll show you , the most fastest possible possible , some fundamental work , some fundamental work , and the new technology that we took to Microsoft in following a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment where you can interact is to local level that remote with an enormous amount of visual data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of digital gigabytal photos with a kind of zoom constant , and continuous fast , for a fast fast fast , disponing the images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big amount of information that we see , how big they are telling them , how big these are collection of data or images .
Most of them are digital photographs , but this is a scan from the Biooo library , and reaches in the Congress , and reaching in the gama of 300 megapixel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only limits that limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also an architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data , not not images .
This is Dickens of Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
To show you that it 's about textbook and not images , we can do something like that , to really make a kind of thing , to really see that it 's a representation of the textbook , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a book electronic book .
I don 't advice it .
This is a more realistic example . It 's about a The Guardian On the Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the beautiful and the experience to read the chart version of a magazine , or a quotidian , which is for nature a lot of toplice .
We also made something with the angle of this particular number of The Guardian .
We created a higher advertising ads -- much more than that than that you use in a normal advertising -- and we put you in a normal advertising .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limitations of space on screen .
We hope that means that that means to put up to the pop-up and other porcherious pop-up , and they don 't need to be .
Of course , the maping is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not lose time , if we don 't have contributes to give even this in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. . Heal-pattern of NASA .
So , we 're going to go to something else .
This is now effectively from the Web ; you can go it to the web .
This is a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research an at the very interesting computer that is made by Noah Snavely , a student of Washington , with Steve Steve Steve Szeliski , with Microsoft Rick . United States of Microsoft Rick . United States . "
And it 's from the Web , gestite by Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can get this image from a image to the other and have this kind of experience .
But the space of the images of the images here has actually meaning .
The Counsualization algorithms of the computer recorded these images together , so that correspond to the real place in real place that the imaging -- all of the screaming . You can see the Grasis on Montagages -- they 're taken . And so , you see elements of a slide-slide-stable show stand-stable , and these things are all space space space space space .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Noahh-- and this is from a previous prototype of Photosynth that we 've made to work for the first time , summer , to show you what I think is really the key behind this technology , the Photosynth . And it 's not necessarily by looking at the environments that we put in the website .
We had to worry about the lawy-and-a-waiting aspects and so on .
This is a rebuild of the Notre catthedral Dame of the Dame of the Flickr . Basta digitar Notre and you get images of the maglights , and you get images of a shirt , other of the campus , and so on . Ognizing these arancions , you know , it 's discovery to this model .
So they 're all taking from Flickr , and they were all connected to the space level in this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this way simple .
You know , I 'd never have thought to end up with Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying to get this kind of accouncience here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different types of different sets of phones : from those of the phones to the professional SLR , a meaning number , meaning number , must together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try to get those strange .
Many are block , etc .
Somewhere you find a series of photographs -- here it 's a series of photographs .
This is a Notre Dame recorded correctly .
We can get from the poster to the vision of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the ential memory of how to appear , from the entire perspective -- and you connect all those data together .
All those pictures become connected , more than the sum of the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the entire that emerges .
Think about this as a Stephen Lawler 's work on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as a complexity that people use it , and the whose advantages to the use .
Their pictures are rock with other people .
If somebody 's idea of contraction all these saying the notion of these saying the name , my picture of Notre Dame , you suddenly gets to all of the data , and I can use it as a point of instead of all of the data , and I can use it as a social experience of anybody else , and having a social experience of cross-moved from anybody else , and having a social experience of cross-moved from cross-mode and red experience of all .
Of course , a consequence of this are virtual models of all interesting models of the earth , and collected not only -- you 're collected with no aircrazy images and satellitarian images and similar , but from the collective memory .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software is going to be able to do is that a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs shared by anybody in the entire world will be basically linked together ?
BAA : Yes . What he 's doing is doing is basically to find .
He 's creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the basis of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about security semantic information that many of these images have a lot of these images .
As you get a picture of the web , you 're typically , and the text on the web page has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what if that picture is to all your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection and semantic and the amount of wealth that is really huge . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible . It 's really incredible .
BAA : You ththanks very much .
One of the major pleass when you travels and one of the ethnographics is the power of live in the wind , who has no forgots in the wind , and touches in the wind stone , touches in the wind stone , driving in the wind leaf , driving in the floating , and drawing it in .
Basti to think that the Jaguar travel even beyond the Via of the Militititititititititititititititititititititself , or in Himalayas , the buddddress still follow the importance of Dharma , to remember the importance of the Dharma , and that the idea that the world that we live in living is not a model , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of adaptations that our own own own own own own intually , a lot of generations ago .
And of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
All we can do . We all do .
We 're subjects to be retending .
We need to deal with the inesorability of death , so you don 't surprising and you can see if we 're going to get and ballize --
We all have art .
What hits is the physical rate of the song , the rate of every culture .
Not matter that they 're the Penan 's forests of the Borneo , or the following Vooodoo , or the desert of Kaisut in Kaisut in Kenya settentries , or a cameras in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey companion in the desert a month ago , or a humped of yak , or a humpal , in the world .
All of these populations teachers that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of mudddle in the world .
And if you can see a second , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
And along , the cultures of the world 's cultures create a spiritual and cultural life that has flights planet and it 's important to well-being on the planet as the planet as the ragela as the biological biosphere .
And you can think about this ragnature as a cultural as a ethnosphere and you can define the sum of all the concepts , dreams , dreams , ideas , inspiration , inspiration , ideas , inspiration , inspiration , inspiring , intuitions , inspiring , intuitions ,
The ethnosphere is the patrimony of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how species .
And because the biosphere was free consumed in the ethnosphere and purfortunately much faster .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the orlo of the same as the horle of the extinction , because it 's false -- in the most optimistic hypocalyphical -- and you don 't even even even even as well as well as as as as as as as as a crowd as well as a critical .
The index of all that is , obviously , the language of it .
When you 're born there were 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only from a vocabulary or a series of rules , or a series of rules .
A language is the human spirit .
It 's the midddle of every culture is coming in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a beautiful way , a spiritual thinkers .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we 're sitting here to Monterey , at least half of the children .
They don 't get more teached to children , which means , unless you have to do something , which is already death .
What 's more sad than being the silence , the last few sads to be the last telling a language , not having to get the wisdom of promise or promise promise promise ?
This is a faired of somewhere in some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks a old old later , and it 's going to themselves in the last syllables of a ancient language .
And I know somebody who 's going to say , " Isn 't it better ?
The world would not be a better place if we 're all talking about all the same language ? " Well , then we 're talking to all yorba . We 're talking about cantonese .
Let 's talk about kogs .
You 'll find a tract thing that means you can 't talk to its language .
I 'm going to do a journey through the journey --
a little journey in etnosphere to give you a hire of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of existing really different ways to exist .
Let 's take this for example Barasana , in Amazon the baby , the anaccording to the anacon the snail , which creating the myth of the snaps of the snaps of the snaps of the sacred lats .
It 's about a popular that 's not able to distinguished the blue because it 's time it 's identified in the forest time , where they depend the population .
They have a strange language and a regle , deted language , " exogamy " : You have to marriage a different language .
Everything has radical in the past , yet the partnership , the particular families that are about these extended families where you 're talking about six or seven languages no one practice .
They 're just to listen to listen to and then start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribe that I lived , the Waorani Waorani Eastern Ecuador , a population that has been the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionaries have taken a committing contact with a factor .
They did come from the highest photographs that were returned them into a few who had adishing , and forest that this population population population had never seen .
They 've collected the picture of the Earth , they turned them to the research of a shape , and not find nothing , they have concluded that it was the diavel , and they kill five missionarious missionarious missionarious with the light-missionarious pictures .
But the Waorani must not only kill the strangers .
They killed with them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We have likely to generations and we found two cases of natural death and when we indeed to know , they admit to know , they admit was so invited that one of them was invent , and then they kill it the same . [ Then they had a very incredible knowledge of forest .
The crazers were able to recognize the animal of 40 steps and recognize it .
In the first 1980s , I was assigned a very interesting task when my professor of Harvard asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti in Haiti , I 'm going to be intruly , in the Tonton Macoutes and Tonton Macoutes and Macoutes , and impossessing me .
To give a sense of miraculous , I should have to understand the culture . And that Voodoo or is not magic .
It 's a fairly of complex metaphysical vision in the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianem , Islam , Budddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddddism .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious foundly . And the Voodoo is not that the distillate of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these very profound nate concepts of slavery .
What makes the vote is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , you know , the spirits .
The spirits can be invocated by the Great Acqua , and they would replace to the dance of dance and dance temporary soul of the vive , that for a short , and it 's a little bit of the following becomes the dium .
And for this voodooists love to say , " You go to church to the talk of God .
We say in the temple and we forget God . "
And from the moment you 're going to be , is the spirit that you are , as you can do the evil ?
So you 're looking at these incredible events : following vote in the state of trance that touching unks and unfuel , a very strongly demonstration , when it 's catalyed in a state of extreme , when it 's catalyed in a state of extreme of extreme , when it 's catalyed in a state of extreme , when it 's catalyzed .
And in all populs that I lived the most extraordinary people are the Sierra Nevada de Sierra Nevada de Sierra Nevada de Sierra , in Colombia .
Take the ancient civilization of the ancivilization , which was living on the planets of Colombia in the walking .
In a blood continent macky , this popular population never been conquered by the spagnology .
At today , they 're governed by a clerer-clery , but their training is decisions .
The young people follow come from the family to the families to three or four years , and they live in a good world and secregated in a world of stone , and habit of stone of the glacier for 18 years .
Two draft periods of nine years of propost to reproduce the nine months of gestation , which spent in the user of the mother , they are metaphorically in the Great Mother .
And for all that time , they get acculturated to the values of their society , values that they predict their predict and just their predict the cost ecology -- or to say the ecological balance .
And the term of this incredible initiation , they 're sudden , and they 're all sudden , at the age of 18 , they see a high . And in that moment of consciousness , when the sun beautiful step , when the sun beautiful valley of the landscape , everything that has learned in theory is to confirm all its spending theory . The prete behind . The precise does a step back . The prete behind .
" Vison ? " I 'm like I said . "
It 's amazing . It 's about you protect it . "
They 're called the larger brothers and they say that we , brothers , are the college of destruction of the world .
This is intuition is extremely important .
When we think about indeed populations and the environment we 're in the environment , which is a razy , which is a razy , which is a razy in its simplicity or maybe we 're saying these populations are closer to the Earth of us .
The Indience are not feels , or feels are not feels or indebate from the nostalogy .
There 's no space for these things in the malaries of the Astpalues or the Tibet , but thank you , with the time and retended , they created a mistic of the Earth based on the concept of being known as well as well as well as it is .
What does ? mean mean ?
It means that a kid of the Ande that a who grows of Ande that the mountain is a beat . Apu that he will drit his destiny , and it 's going to have a very different relationship , and it 's going to have a different rocket . And it would answer a kid in Montana or that place 's going to grow up with a male of Montana .
That 's the hour of a spirit or a mineral city is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the report of the report between the natural and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the British Columbia Bannica creding that forests service to be cut .
And that made me a human being from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that forests are the forests of Hukuk and the wheeling of the paradise and the dogs of the paradise and the dogs that live on the north of the world , spirits that live in the north Hukukwakid .
If you start to look at these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some their sensitive discoveries . We take this piece of plant .
I took this picture to open it in the nordocted Amazon .
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayahuks , the most powerful submit of the sciamanic repertoire .
What makes the playahuash is not the physank is not the physical potential of the substance , but its elements . It 's two elements from two elements .
It 's from a hall , this leasant league that contains a series of betacarboline , harmed and harmed , slightly hallucinogenes .
And by taking the only plant you have a blue that alters a little bit of consciousness , but it 's mixed with the leaves of a householding family said , " The coffee of the Psychotridis .
This plant takes powerful powerful , very similar to serotonin the serotonin , dispthoxoxyplyplypltrylthoyplyplyplyplyplyplytlens .
If you ever see Yanomami , you 'll see the nose the substance that do from a different set of species , anchy , it 's about methoxyplyplyplyplyplyplyplyplyltryplyplyplyplags .
And to irate that dust for the nose is like being dissolve from a bit of the pain of painting pain and they can be landing on a sea of electricity . You don 't create a destation of reality .
I had a lot of it with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who brought the psychedelic was , with his discovery of the fungi in Mexico .
I think my thesis , you can 't get these tripams like hallucinogens because if you 're not telling one of being told . And the triptamines . And the triptamines can 't be horally because they 're money from a physician that 's naturally in the intestine , deted by the intestine monoxinossize .
It 's possible to sumerely whatever they just can be assumption with other chemicals that money at MAO .
Now it 's the beautiful : carbon , carbon dioochemical , in the same liana of MAO , the same kind of potential to the tripamine . The question is spontaneous source : in a 80,000 species of plants , like these populations to find two men morphogically , but that if you combine , but that if you combine , in this way , create a biochemical version of parts ?
We use the great euate euphermism and the mistake , which can be infruttive .
But if we ask Indians , they 'll tell us , " The plant plant will talk about it . "
What does ? mean mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , the Meahumpahumpahumpahumpy , and that our eyes would be going to the same species .
If we ask them as they 're going to stabilish telling us , " I thought I 'd understand plants about plants , you don 't know everything ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you get the 17 varieties in a night of moon and each night , and each other . It 's going to be a different .
With this is not laurea at Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that contt the stami .
Now , [ the ] ] the problem is that even the ones that have indeed with ingenes that are the ingenes are painting , but somehow reduced to the hall of the history of our real world , and pass beyond .
In fact , the 19th century , between 300 years , it will not remember for the wars or its innovation , but rather like the technology , but rather like the same as the era that we were stopped and we huge actively or destruction of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new lifetime .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux don 't stop being Sioux when they put out of the arc and further as well as Americans don 't stop being Americans and they put on it out .
It 's not the change or technology that threatening the integrity of ethnosphere .
The domination flight .
And if you look at the world , you 'll find that these are not destined cultures that these are not destined cultures .
They are living and dynamics and dynamics out of identifable to identify that are beyond their ability to adaptation .
Which is that it 's disboscencing in the Penan 's patrit --
a popular popular nomake Sarak , in the Southeast Asian , a popular who lived in the forest to a generation , and now reduced to the servitos and prostitution on the redress of the rivers , where you can see the rive of the rivers , where you can see the rivers of the Borneo Merian Cindidididian Merian , where the Ellumind , where naves navels the horizonessean ,
ready to fill the woowners with the dream .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease of the golden .
If we move on the mountains of the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard of political domination .
As the genocide , the physical extinction of a population , is convicted to universal level , but the ethnocide , the destruction of the lifestyle , not only is convicted , but it 's not just convicted , but it 's a celebrated for the environments , because it 's part of the strategy of development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet suffering of the Tibet until you go from the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in the Western China through the South Eastern Tibet , and I realized what we have to be able to Lhasa with a young , and I realized what we heard about .
6,000 sacri reduced to dust and crazy .
1.2 million people killed by military military people on the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical at the Panchen Lama .
which means that it 's been killed to the time of the Chinese invasion .
His uncle furniture in Santity , during the diaspora that led the population in Nepal .
His mother been impresoned and his colpattern was to be rich .
It was taken in the age of two years , hidden age at the age of two years under his gonna because he could not live in him .
The sister , which made the same , was mesh in reeducation .
One day has welled a day a coffered fashion Mao and , for this transgression , was mesh to the works forced for seven years .
The Tibet can be insuper-branching , but the record of the population is to the population .
And then , everything reduces a choice .
We want to live in the world monothy of monotonia or we want to acak the polopies of diversity ?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he die said that his biggest fear was that , in our going to go to this love of the world , not only see the entire gamma of human imagination of human imagination , but one day we 'll see it from a sonm to forget to a sonnot forget to forget to a sonnurse .
And it 's humiliating our species has been for 60,000 years .
The Neolitics Revolution , who gave us the agriculture , which made us to suck in the seed culture of the seed , and we just skie with the chlero , creating the gerarchy of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has been 300 years .
That 's a story that is not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we 're going to deal with the millennia that we 're going to get .
When these miriades of the world is asked what it means to be human , they 're answering 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that all we 're all risky the chance of being what we are are : a conscious , that has to make all the people and all the garden . And there 's there are great optimism .
I took this picture on the northern extremity of the island of Baffin , when I went to the hunt of the Baffin the Inuit , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , which tells me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The canader 's not always been gentle with the Inuit and the 1950s and in the 1950s to stabilists , we 've rhink them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , the family , and I took him all his tools , and all his attices .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't matter the cold , they exploit .
The bats of the slites were made of fish .
The grandfather of this man didn 't intimise from the artical night or from the libraries ,
It 's gatting away , you 've got the pantalone in the skin and focused in your hand . When the tollama of his hand . When the tan they have been conglama .
He spruised on the door of this caccept of the cables and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
He goes down the dog and created a shake , with the house hands , made a slethllaughter , and it 's disappear on the bankners , and it 's disappear on the flknife ,
We want to talk about cavarsely with nothing ? [ That , that , in different ways , and Applausi is the symbol of the resilience of the popular Inuit and all the populations of the world .
In the California As 1999 , the canader Inuit , the total control of a larger territory of California and Texas Maybe together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's an independent territory . They controlate all the minerary resources .
One wonderful example of how a nation-state can remember with his population .
And , to finish , I think it 's quite obvious at least at the time who of us was in these remote zones of the planet , to remote that they are not remote .
For somebody 's house .
They represent human imagination that are humans that are telling at the hall of the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , like dreams of the hope .
To finish , we have National Geographic are convinced that politicians will never get to nothing .
We believe that polemiics --
[ Applausi ] don 't be persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Each month 35 million lives . Each our website . Each our website . Every month is 35 million lights .
156 countries transmit our television .
Our re-laughts from millions of people .
Our work is travel to bring our audience in the place of wonders that they will go away from the critical place of the beyond the way they can see , and hopefulticulticle will be hug for the central reveal of the anthropology : the world 's going to be in a multicultural world 's lifestyle .
where the wisdom of all populs can contribute to our well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I 've written in this book that I hope you 've already heard more than you 've heard and I 'll try to evidence some of connections , in case not the notaste .
I want to start with what I call the " the dogma official dogma . "
The dogma official dogma of what ?
The dogma official dogen from all the Western industrial dogen : " If we want to male the wealth of our citizens . " The way to do it is to massive liberty . "
The reason is , from a side , in the fact that freedom is in itself a value , it 's precious , useful , essential for humans .
And the other is , if we 're free , each of us can act for all of us can act for all that massive , our well-being , no one that decided in our well-being , no one that decide in our well-us .
The way to massive freedom is massive to be a choice .
More choice people , more choices , the more than people are free , and more than they are well-being .
This , I think , is so deeply radicated in society that nobody would dreaded to doubt it .
And it 's also deeply falls in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I 'm a simple note about condition .
In my supermarket there are 175 condless , without contate the 10 oil variety of oil and the 12 acetes and the balsams that you can buy for you a huge number of constantly in the surrounding circumstance that no 175 ready ready ready ready to be your degree .
Here 's what supermarket is .
Then you go to the electronics stereo to buy a stereo : casse , lector CD , radio , radio , the CD , radio , the prints , the priner .
And in this single electronics , there 's a big audio of components .
We can do six and a half million different ways of using the components that there are only in one only one store .
You have to admit that there 's a lot of choice .
Other the camps : The communications world 's communications .
And once I was a kid , when I was a kid , you could get all the phone services that were provide by mom Bell .
It was for the phone , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , between the other , was that the telephone never break .
These days went .
We have a variety of phones , especially in the cell phones .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is the middddle , MP3 , tactor , and it holes in the hols , and the holding for the crash .
If you haven 't seen it in the store under the store , you 're going to be able to take it .
And what happens is that people enters are in the stick and and asked this question . And you know what ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too many things .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the acquired of the aquid of choices .
Anoise healthcare : it 's not going on the United States that you walking to the United States and doctor you have to do .
You 're going to go from the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do A , or B , " A , " A has these benefits and these risks " Be has these benefits and these risks . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Dottore , what would I have to do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , and B has these risks and these risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you can rebuts : " Dr. " If she was me , what would do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not she . "
The result of the result of the malate , expression that makes it seem to be a nice thing .
But it 's actually not that a moving the weight and the responsibility of making decisions that anything , which is doctor , to somebody else that 's nothing -- and almost of course , and it 's not in the ideal condition to take a decisions that they can be .
There 's a huge marketing of pharmaceuticals , direct people like me and you , that if you don 't think about , it 's not a sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do they publishing them ?
The answer is that they want to do it .
Something as it fundamental as our identity is a question of choice , how you see in this vignize , " we don 't want to force the children . We don 't want to give the kids . Scex it 's going to ceat the right time , " We have to invent it . We need to invent it .
And we can reinvent us how many times we get .
That means that every morning , at the morning , at the morning , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
I 'm going to hear the family and marriage , a common time , a common time , almost soon for anyone , and it was that it was that you marriage the most possible possible .
The only real choice was choice was with who , not when , and not even when , and not even what to do after .
At day , all the time , all that 's really player .
I teach very intelligent students , and I 'm going to give them a time .
And not because they 're less diligent , because they 're less diligent .
But why are they impensiered , you know , " Do I have to married me or not ? "
" Would I get marrier ? " I have to think about before or the career ? "
I 'm interrogative interrogative .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implay , even if this implay not the tasks that lists and get a beautiful vote to my own .
And they really have to do it . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl underlying , because it allows us to work every minute , every day , from each day , from the Hotel Randolph .
And there 's a corner , and I 'm not going to tell you that anybody where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this incredible freedom of choice we have about the work ? It 's all about the work ? It 's that we have to continue or not .
We can go to the son playing , with the cell phone in a pocket , the Blackberry in the other , and the notea , and the notea books .
And if they 're all spent , every minute that we see our baby , we 're also asking it , " Do have to answer this called ? "
" I have to say that ? " Do I have to habe this letter ? "
And when the answer is no , " all this makes the experience of your son , very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , whatever we look at , little things , and big things , big , material and the lifestyles , life is a question of choices .
The world was this : On the world was this : Overs there were some chance , but not all was a question of choice .
The world today is it looks like this : The dilemma is , " Is it a good thing , or negative ? "
The answer is .
We all sorts of the slide , so I 'm going to talk about the negative ones .
All this is a little bit of two negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxally , is that produces instead of liberation .
With the options of which choose to choose , becomes very difficult to do .
I offer you a meaning example : a conduct on the plans of voluntary plans .
A colleague has access to Vanoos , the giant society of the foundation , with about a million clients implessons , with about a million clients implying in 2,000 different companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are being offered in more , the percentage of adesion , the midddle of two percent .
With 50 funds of offered , there 's 10 percent in less adesions than when they 're available to only five ?
Because with 50 funds of the ones that choose , is sick .
And then , and again , and I 'm still asking , and I 'm asking , and of course , tomorrow , and of course , and tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and of course , tomorrow , and of course , and of course , tomorro
You know that doesn 't mean only that these workers are going to be eating food for dogs because they 're not going to have enough money , it also means that the decision is to be so hostics that they lose the funds of the complementary .
Not in the cycling , they 're losing to five dollars a year from the work dator of work , which would be well to be very much .
So , the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world .
" And to finish , " eth-eth-ethup , or maionese ? "
You want to take the right decision , if it 's the right decision , if it 's for ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the source , and you don 't want to choose the wrong condivestation .
So this is the first effect . The second is that if we can avoid the paralysis and make a choice , at the end , we 're less than we 're going to have been with less options than than the result of how we would choose .
And that 's that for several reasons .
One of these is that many conditions of those is that you can choose , if you buy one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that you could do a different choice that alternative imagined us . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us . And what happens is that you can imagine ,
And when it was a good decision .
More there are , the more of it is easy to be dispioneering than any detail that 's option of choice .
And there is what economists call constood called the constood .
Dan Gilbert asks very well as a value that we do with things about what we compare .
And in the rest , when there are lots of options , it 's easy to be able to repress the alternative to the high-be toptions and be less satisfacts of the option that is choice .
Here 's an example . I school with all the people who are not New York .
But it 's what you probably think .
There 's this couple at the Hamptons .
A place of lurse .
It 's beautiful . It 's all about it . It 's all about them .
I don 't miss anything . But what he thinks is , " Well , it 's Agodests . "
" All my neighborhoods are away . "
" I could talk about front of home . "
And it spent two weeks of the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the chance of parking , you know , the chance of parking .
The constood is the satisfy , for what we have , even when choice was excellent .
And more are the options that we have to look at , the more the characteristics will come back to us as constantly as constantly constantly .
Here 's another example .
This is a vignize a lot of things .
It 's about living the moment , and maybe living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you do , you choose to do them , you 're going to do the other .
The things that we don 't choose are active attractive to make less attractive what we do .
Third point : it 's a growing expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new jeans of jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
And once the jeans were only like , they buy them and bought them from bestia , they were moving , just after they brought them a living and jeans , and washed a lot of times , they started to go well .
So , I went to buy a new new when the old old man who were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my wrong tells . "
The commit told me , " He wants to me slim , easy fit , relaxed ? "
You want them to do it with the buttons or with the buttons ? " Stonewashed , " or " accompanies ? "
" Do you want them strapted ? "
" Sott the blades or strate blah . " Bla bla bla -- " Continuate to elencare .
I was slater , and after a while I was able to say , " I want the guy that was the only like , " I want to do the kind of , " I tried to me all the maledess jeans , and then come out of the jeans , I would come out of the jeans that ever had .
It was the massive . I had the whole choice had the best .
But I was hearing about .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all the things that I was all the time with the aspectations were very high , the jeans had to be perfect .
I had expectations waited . I wasn 't expected anything that was just a guy , but when it 's only seen a kind of a kind of , but when it 's saw , at least a guy , at least a guy ,
What I had bought was good , but I don 't perfect .
After I had compared that choice with what I was trying to do with what I was trying to expectations .
The addition of options in the lives of people don 't do that to increase expectioning the excellence of the same .
And that will produce less satisfy , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world 's marketing for it .
Because if they knew about , you would not know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more like this .
" You were better when he was worse , " The reason you were better when she was worse , it was worse , when she was worse , it was still possible to meet .
And the day , in the world we live in -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the expectation of the expectation -- the massive that we can hope is that things are at the height of the expectations .
You never surprised to be surprised because your expectations , the mies are ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse expectation " Yes , " Yes , you want . "
I mean , a little mothers -- that I 'm really married and my wife is really amazing .
I wouldn 't have to do better , I don 't have accontent .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of the buy jeans in the block of jeans is that when you don 't satisfacts , and you say , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " The answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What do I do you do ?
When you have hundreds of jeans , and you buy a jeans , and you buy the insuitable , and you ask you who 's the responsible , it 's as clear that responsible is you .
You 'd have been doing better .
With hundreds of varieties available , there are no excuse .
So when people are decisions , even if the result is willing , you know , you know , and they give the colvous to themselves .
In the last few years , the depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a factor -- not the only important , but that 's important -- not only about this wave , but important , people have to have the people of deludgments , because the standards are too higher .
And when they have to explain this situation think that color is they 're .
So the final result is that we 're better , in general , we 're better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogma , what we all all take for good and it 's completely not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than having it , but it 's not at at all , but it 's not to have a little bit better than it .
There 's a critical value , magic value . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been playing that we 've played from a piece of the level where they improve our lives .
Now , from the political point of view -- I 've almost finished -- from political point of view , the political nocycle is the following .
What allows all this choice in industrial society is the material .
There are many places in the world , and you know about it , where the problem is not they have too much choice .
The problem is they have too much .
So the face that I 'm talking about is a whose of modern , you know , the recently of Western , recently ,
And what does have to mention and is this : Steve Levitt spoke about how those expensive and the car discovers of how those men are inured . It 's a spreef of money .
I mean these choices , complicated and dispendious , it 's not just inured .
I 'm going to say of that .
They get worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows that they have been reversed in those where people are too few possibility , not only would be their lives , but also , we can 't do our better .
This is what economists call a paretian improvement .
A redistribution of the income is good at all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice , excess that it comes back us .
To conclude , " You can become everything that you want , "
You know , people are you going to think , " What does that fish do you think , " What does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get to a glass . "
" A imagination , a limited view of the world -- "
And I 'm interested in this , at the beginning .
But then , you know , instead , I realized that fish the long-term knows .
Because the reality of the fact is , if you mands the bock , so that , " all you can 't get the freedom . You get the paralysis . You get the paralysis .
If you break the boat so that all you can decrease .
You get the paralysis , and you 'll reduce the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too , maybe even for the fish , and it 's not a fish .
But it 's not a blue of some symbolics sphere is a recipe for infection and , for robine .
Thank you very much .
