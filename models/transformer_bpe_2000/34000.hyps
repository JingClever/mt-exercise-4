I 've been shown this last year , which is a deep-six-to-demonstrate glacial , which for almost three million years had the size of the United States continental , and it 's refted about 40 percent .
But this subjects that is the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice of ice .
The artta glacial calots is , in a sense , the cleaning of the global climate system .
It 's winter expands of summer and gets summer .
The next slide is going to be a fast carrying on the last 25 years .
The ice lost lost of drives are in red .
As you see , they expand to the blue blue .
That 's the ice in winter , which is reverse summer .
You can see that the ice cosidgn , of five years or more , it 's like five years or more , is like blood , that 's like the blood , which is like the body is blood .
In 25 years , it 's been so ,
This is a problem because the warming warming in the ocean , in the ocean , where there are enormous amount of coal congeld that , skie , sitting , they 're transformed into microbes .
I respect to the totality of global atmospherical warming , that amount of global warming , that amazing point of the stage .
In some deep laghs in Alaska , in Alaska metane is already rebulating water .
The professority Katey Walter of Alaska , a team , I recked a team with a team , at a team , you know ,
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You 're good . I 'm going to be .
A reason is that this termal exchange that is that Greenland from the northern Greenland .
This is a glacial river .
The loud never had to reach levels .
This is the Kangerlushes , in southwest in the southwest of the Greenland .
If you want to know how to hear the level of sea , to sea level of ice , here is where you reach the sea .
These corrups are increasing rapidly .
As the other hand : Antarctica , the greatest blowing ice of ice on the planet .
The last month of the scientists have been under the galances of ice is in negative , and that Antarctica Western , which is a pogestern on some islands , is particularly fast in the slands .
That 's six meters of the level of the handle , like Greenland .
SulHimalayas , the third biggest block , you see new laghi , which was a few years ago , that were glacier .
40 percent of the world population is going to be population half the water from that slide .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the powering water source of this city .
The downnaked .
But when it decreases , the same happens to be powering water .
In California the snow on Sierra Nevada is deminuity of 40 percent .
Highborhood are in cribe .
The predictions , as you read , they 're faves .
The growing secus in the world leads to a remarkable car .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm out of normal and without precedented .
Four times as many number of times in the last 30 years than 75 .
This is a whole thing that 's a sustainable .
If you look at it in the historical consequences .
In the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of tons of CO2 every 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look attentially the East area of the East Pacific , given to the west , and on both west , and on both parts of the subcontinent , where there 's a poor impoor in the oceans .
Most of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent of the world , which is 20 percent of fossil combustiable use .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States is one of the most emissions , together to China .
And he was proposed to build a lot of carbon .
But we 're seeing to a direction of a direction .
These are annoullated projects in the last few years and some proposes of alternative proposes .
And at every way , there 's a politics in our country .
The coal industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote carbon , which is a bad .
And that picture , I reminded me something --
I 'm Natal , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion liters of coal gallers .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second biggest flow of scories in America .
It happened around the Natal .
The nature of one of the coal commercial industries was this .
Video : â™« Frosty carbon is a guy , it 's a pleger and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it growth our economy .
Frosty carbon is and more and more publisher .
It 's a good price , adorable , and the workers are keeps .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest ministrator society is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'll be a -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reeean -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alliance for the Clima of Clima has launched two campaigen .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Actor : Actor , we see the climate change as a serious threat our business .
So our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a public effort to make public and confused truth and confused truth .
In fact , coal , the coal is not sports .
We think it 's clean , it 's also a good provide .
So , not preocupats of climate change .
Let do it .
Video : Actor : Carbon -- you 've heard of it .
So let 's let 's take a turn into a structure at the traveling of the bad is clean .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noious , but this is the sound of the technology of coal technology .
The carbon consumption is between major global warming , but the remarkable technology , but the night of coal technology that you see it changes everything .
Let 's look at a look . This is the hodial technology of clean .
Al Gore : Finally , the positive alternative alternative issue and to the economic security and the national security .
Video : Comvast America is in the crisis , the national security , the national security , climate crisis .
The floor that the bottom that we have dependence on fossils , like coal coal and oil .
Now , there 's a new , there 's a new , cars solution for using it .
Repower America : 100 percent clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work , make sure , and make sure us to stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that you were solving our problems .
Repower America . Scover more .
Al Gore : This is the last last .
Video : Comvice : It 's about re-giving energy to America .
And one of the fastest ways to get to dependence on the dependence that they kill our planet .
What it 's going to do is . Vind , only a new energy web .
What happened to do is , two : Novi investment for work to work brought .
Comvast : Repower America . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A veck of the African says , " If you want to go fast , you go to the weld .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED I did an introduction on the LHC .
And I promise to address you 're going to address you 're on how the machine works .
So here I 'm . And for those that . And for those that we didn 't have , the LHC is the greatest scientific experiment ever -- 27 kilometers of circuit .
His task is to re-re-re-up conditions that were at less than a billion second of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
All of that is simply environment .
This is the machine under Ginevening .
We 're taking these mini-Big Bang inside the relatively .
This is what I work . This is called ATLAS -- it 's a larger 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in construction , so you can see the proportions .
The 10 September 10 last year we have accese machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was causes immense in control in control .
It 's a picture of the first particles that had done all the around of the LHC , enter in collision , by a part of the LHC , and spreading particles inside the releasing particles inside .
In other words , when we saw that picture 10 september , we understand that the machine worked , which is a great victory .
I don 't know if that was this to make us exultent more or this , when someone went on Google and saw that the initial page was this .
That means we have a cultural impact on the other than scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to these dorry dored here -- these dored dored dorry .
These floor of these floor to leave when the maximum works at the massive of power .
Now , the technicians between you look at the boys and say , " It 's not true . I 'm too hard . "
And they can do that because when they 're very cool the superconditions are superconditions .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a under 271 degrees , to the wind of the space between stars , these floor .
In one of the joined yun-of-nails in LHC , there was a defect of fabrication .
So the floor flights , and the 13,000 printing improviously , and the 10,000 practiced electric resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnets more than 20 tons , and that have been moved about 30 centimeter .
They 're sitting about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we 've done .
We have restined and adjusted .
They 're all rhytheld to their place .
I mean , the end of march up the LHC will be again .
We 're going to accinept it , and we 're going to get to juy or lights , and we 're going to continue to find out what the morning is the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents reaching the debate of science and engineering in frontier than science and engineering . It 's easy to confuture .
I think that 's so hard , I think that 's so hard , I think that 's the value of things like the LHC .
I want to end with the words of a Inglese scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , imagined , in defense experiments of his puple experiments of his puple , Michael Faraday , his puple was a very dangerous for the human mind , as a records of the human mind , and that is not a new way that we think about conquire . "
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink about when you 're , you 're going to play with the morning .
And as you get to reach them , and you 're going to get them and to get them , and you 're learning to think and realize that we can actually think and solving problems and manipulating relationships .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most of the world around us .
So , as a information inspired by the uslity of our physical interaction with my physics , and my consultant , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only cursor of the such as a digital pastry that moves on a desktop of the digital pathetic ches that you can move the gatherwise ,
and sistemarrator to our further ?
The question was so interesting question that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a words , a Siftable computer interactive , like a cookie .
In a words , a Siftable computer interactive , like a cookie .
You can move them with your hand , they can see , " in their hand , you can see their movement and have a screen and a screen and a screen .
But most of course , I 'm physical objects , like the morning , you can just move it .
Siftable is a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physicists , consciously , the other , of the other , and as they become more physical consciously , of the other , of how we move , we can explore new and fun and fun to interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurated to show the video : if it including it in a direction , the video run running so , if you including the other side .
These interactive rats are awarens .
If I do I do , you 're interested in what they 're around .
If they 're surrounded , and they can act a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , and they can act a little bit .
They have been also the movement and inclination .
And then I realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power of data , for example , " to put " a color like a color like it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurated as a bad bad and I can use them to color in that color in that , where they put it .
and I can use them to fall of color in that central , where they put it up .
We can do that , we can reput a little bit of it .
It 's also beautiful possibility of learning , like languages , the mathematics and games where people can try to be able things , and see the results of the immediately results , and you see the immediately results .
Now , I 'm --
This is a sequence of Fibonacks that I do with a program of equations .
We have a game of words that 's half of Scarabean and Boggle .
By , at every turn to get a letter on every Siftable , at every Siftable , at every Siftable , at every Siftable , and while trying to understand the words of the control him on a director .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you get a new set of letters and new chance to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came to the Media Lab , I did so that they would try and have it and spinning a video .
They 're very fliid .
And one of the interesting things about this application is that you don 't have to give people many education .
You just say , " Compons of words , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's how other people who try it .
This is our own header header , on the right .
It actually wanted to impact them .
They were only bring morning , for him .
Now , this is a cardboard application .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of languages is Felix .
It can put up new characters in the scene , solving Siftable to them .
It can put up new characters in the scene , solving Siftable to them .
So it 's doing that , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is .
David Merrill : Now he 's taken a treator in the scene .
Video : The arange treator .
Bel work ! Yes !
So I school at Siftable and put it close to interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
And by inventing your story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It 's a story with the open open final story , and he can decide him as it .
DM : It 's a story with the open open final story , and he can decide him as it .
Video : Volky , throw .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool , realized of the way , to wild and execececk music .
It 's a tool , realized of , to wild and exececk music .
Siftable here are suund as well as sounds , bass and bass and the bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also insert these sounds in a sequence to buy your lives .
And it 's just going to do it to touching a sound and a sequence .
These are effects that you can control from alive , like the reverberation and filter .
I 'm waiting to a particular sound , and then including it .
And then there are the general effects as time and fly , that we applicate to the interest .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : DM : We 'll start putting a base in two Siftable , " sequence , we add the systems , we add the base .
Now I put a bas-bed line .
Video : DM : Now I add some percussions --
Video : And I 'm going to put the battery , so I can control the effect of the alive .
Video : DM : I can fast the whole sequence to inclinking the time by one side or another .
Video : And I 'm going to add the filter to the low low low seat to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can recombine the sequence of the flight .
So I don 't have to plan it first , but I can improvising , realizing it longer or more .
And now , finally , I can move the whole sequence with the left of the Siftable to the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new men interface mumbers and more more and more like how our brain work .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this path , and also a few possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmitting is that new generation of objects designed to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world as the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the hour to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writer .
And I writing books is my profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also the love and the fashing of my life .
And I don 't expect that to change .
But , I said that , something particular happened in my life and in my life , and in my career , which took me to recognize the whole recently realibrate with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called Mangathered , Ama , " which , diversity from my precedented books , for some reason that they came out in the world and become a great sensationship , bestseller , bestseller , bsseller ,
And the result is that everywhere I 'm going to go , people to me as if I was convicted .
For -- convicted , convicted , convicted ,
They 're going to be now worried and they say , " Don 't you be able to do better than doing ?
You don 't hear to keep writing for all life without able to create a book that can important someone who can important someone ? "
what can important to someone ? "
It 's rassure , you know .
But it could go worse , at that , I remember 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent adolescent -- I was a writer .
I went to meet the same reaction as the same as fear .
And people said , " Don 't do that I 'm not going to be able to successful ?
Don 't you hear that the humiliation of the reflick you ?
You 're not afrants to do this for all life without that nothing is that nothing is that you 've ever come out and die on a cumulation with the dinfrants with the handing to fallivests ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I 've always had afraid .
And I 've also afraid of many other things that people might not have to put .
As the other things swking and other things .
But , as I think I 'm writing that I thought and wondering me , and I would ask me , is why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone who has been waiting to be spaved by a job that 's been born to do .
But what 's there so particular in the impress creative to make us nervous health and health and other people can do not do ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember a only in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he fear to be engineer ?
And it was never -- that block of John , how is it ?
It doesn 't work like that , you know ?
Onestly , chemical engineers like group don 't have certainly , in the chemicals , driven the reputation of being alcovered .
We have writers , we have enough this reputation , and not just writers , but creative of every gender , we have this reputation of being enormously unstable mentally .
And I don 't think about the other thing that you look at the sad of the deaths of creative minds that , just in the 20th century , they died young and often for them .
And the ones that are not suicipate to be real dissatisfied by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before you die , in the last interview said , " I 've been killed a little bit more . " A extraordinary affirmation about work .
But we don 't bleap , when we feel that because we 've heard these things that we 've been completely interized that we 've completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering is in some way that the art , at the end , will be hard , will be during ancient annotion .
And the question I want to get to everybody here is : you 're agree with this idea ?
It 's good at this thing -- because you also look at it at it , it 's not good for anything that supposed to me ,
I think it 's horry .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see it in the next century .
I think it 's better encourage our great creative minds to live .
And of course , I know that , in my case -- it would be very dangerous to begin to fire out at that headquarters of supposed , especially by the circumstances in which I 'm in my career .
That 's really -- you know , I 'm pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I 've got about 40 years .
I 've still got about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that whatever I 'm going to write about now , it 's going to be judged by the way that I 'm going to be judging in my book .
I 'm slavery , because we 're all about friends here -- is likely that my greatest success is my biggest handing is to my walking .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the gender of thinking that leads one person to start behind a person to start behind , and I don 't want to do it .
I 'd like to keep doing this work that I love .
So , the question is , how do it ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflections , that the way to work to keep writing coual courial cougical cougical cougical cougical cougical coures , OK ?
I have to have a security distance of security between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural anxiety on which is going to be able to get . And as I was trying to this last year , trying to find other societies to see whether they could have better ideas and look through the time , trying to find other societies to see whether they could have better ideas and smarier
about how to help creative people to manage inherent inherent inherent people of creativity .
And that research a research Greach and ancient Rome .
Seguitem because I 'm going back to circle and then back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity was going to be , OK ?
And it was thinking about creativity is that spirit is that they were death and that was that they were from someone who 's source and unknown , for the distant reasons and unknown .
The greeeign called these spirits of creativity of creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a demon that elargive wisdom .
Romanious were the same idea , but they called that spirit up a kind of spirit without a genius .
And that 's great , because Romanids don 't think that a very , that a genius was a very smart .
They have to be a genius to be a genius of devices that he was literally lived in the walls of the study of a job , a little bit like the elfo Dobby , and that came out to hidden the work of artist and modeling the result of that work .
Except -- here 's the distance of which I talk about -- that 's the psychological cougical that you protected from the results of your work .
And everybody knew that it was so that it worked , right ?
So , the anti-s-protected artists , as for example , as a too narcissism , right , right ?
If your work was exceptional work was not going to take all the deserve , everybody knew that was helped by this genius .
If your failure , it wasn 't all your lives , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people han conceived creativity in Western Westerman for a long time .
And then Renascivement came and everything changed , and it 's born this big idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe , and the later and without leaving space to mitive creatures that they write from divinity .
This was the rational principle of humans and people began to think that creativity was completely from ishared idivided .
And for the first time in history , I started to refer this or that artist as a genius as a genius rather than one person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big herror .
I think that we allow someone , a simple person to believe that being like a recipient as the source , and the source of all the divines , creative , unknown , inosconcible and etherny responsibility to humans .
It 's like to ask someone to inguiate the sun .
Force and destroying the ego and creates all these inextremendous informance .
And I think it was this pressure to destroyed in the past 500 years .
And , if that 's true , and I think that 's the question is , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe back to a more ancient compassion of humans and creative mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of rational thinking in a talk of 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would sold to the notion of scientific notion , insospects that they do spect , you know , you do that they do follow on their projects .
I 'm probably not going to convince you all of that .
But the question I 'd like to get is -- why not ?
Why not think that way it 's not thinking about that ?
Because it 's more sense of everything that I 've ever heard to explain the exasperformance of the process of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who I 've ever taken to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- it doesn 't understand rationally .
And , in fact , it can sometimes it looks completely paranormal .
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poeteteteteteteteteteteteteteteteteteteteteteth , and he was a poetthetic for all life and told me that during the rural the Virginia , and he felt it , in the fields , and he felt , in the way , and I felt it , in the way , and when a poem .
He said , he was like a broader , you know ,
And that was running to her landscape .
He heard it to be , because he was so much to hold it .
He had one thing to do about that point and it was , words , and it was words , " run as a matta . "
And so he run back home and he was going to be saved by this poem , and it would not have to make a piece of paper and a match and a match fast enough , as it 's a fast , and collecting it and deal with it on the page .
Sometimes you couldn 't be fast , so he runs and it would run and run without able to get into the home and her poetry her to purpoetry to her and perdeep and he would keep roundant through the landscape , like , and he said , " another poet . "
And then there were those times -- this piece of the time -- this is there was moments that we 've never forgotten to be losing it , OK ?
So , he was running at home and he was trying to be looking for the card and poem it was going through , and he was a very switch in , and then he said , that was like , he was going to sleep with the other hand and and the step .
And he was going to the poem from the tail and put it on her body and transpored it on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page and intact , but on the last word at the first .
So when I felt that -- I thought , it 's exactly equal , it 's exactly equal to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a music , and my way of working is , and I wake up to the same orary himself every day and to work and go to work and pass us .
But even I , in my headquarterial , I 've striked against that thing , at times .
And I imagine that many of you , the han done .
You know , even though the work and ideas came to me from a certain source , I could not lost honestly .
What is that ?
And how can we relate to it to us to do it , but , rather , rather , that 's how do we do healthy ?
As I think about , the best example of the contemporary example I have is the Tom Mr. Waits , which I 've interviewed in a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life has been the incarnation of the articulartment , trying to contemporary , trying to check , to manage , dominating these species of creatives totally interized interized .
But then I 'm going to invest , and he 's driving on a day as he was driving on a autost in Los Angeles , he changed everything to him .
It was going to fast and all of a sent tract this little bit of melody , which is coming into its heads as inspiration , and it wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and it 's wonderful , and it 's wonderful , and the desider , but not as you take it .
It doesn 't have a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a match , it has no register .
So he begins to feel this kind of old anxiety , " I 'm going to lose it , and I 'm going to lose it , and I 'm going to lose .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , they stop .
I 'm going to do the whole process of mental .
I 'm going to look at the sky and said , " Scuses , you can 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" As you can write a song han hour ?
If you really want to exist , back to a more opports when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , I go to important somebody else today .
You go to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his work process .
I don 't work , the work was still dark as a always .
But the process , and the fish that was that attacked him when the genius , the genius , the genius that was going to be able to do it back to where they were , and he remained it back where they were , to make that they didn 't have to be a interior thing .
but it 's gone to the peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange thing that 's not Tom .
So , as I felt that story , I started a little bit even that I worked and already to save me once .
This idea , I walked when I was writing " Manogy , Prega , Ama , " and falls in one of those cave disperation where we 're working on something and we can 't start thinking that it 's going to be a disaster , that 's going to be a little bit of wrote , that that 's going to be the worst book .
Not just bad , just the worst books .
And I started to think about gathering this project .
But then I remember Tom that was talking about air and I tried to us .
So I got my face on the manished and recognized my common corner corner corner corner corner .
And I said to come up , " Sent , what 's , both of course , that 's not going to be brilliant , it 's not going to be interly colcolcolors , not it ?
Because as you see , I 'm going to put all that I have , I don 't have any more than that .
So , if you want to be better , you have to present and make your part .
OK . But if you do it , you know what , I don 't do anything .
I 'm going to write about the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to make my part of the middle that I 'm presented to do my part of doing my part of the North of Africa 's deserts in North deserts people in North sacred people to damaging for a clear of sacred damages and music that they were going to go on for hours and hours .
And they were always magnificent , because the balleras professionals were professionals .
But every once , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists becoming actually transpendent .
And I know what I 'm talking about , because I know you all of you have seen it , at some point , a performance .
It was like the time stopped , and the dancerine ballery , and it wasn 't doing anything different from the usual , as the 1,000 night before , but it was sitting .
And suddenly , it doesn 't appear to just like a human .
But you get accurate from under the fire in fire in the fire of divinity .
And when that was happening , at the time , people knew what was , they called it with her name .
They were asked their hands and started to canting , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God . "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note -- when the Mororororan , the south of the Spain , I took this abitudines with them and the pronounded in the hundred , Allah , Allah , " that 's the run , " that you can still feel in the roride or flams .
In Spain , when an artist has done something impossible and magical , " Allah , words , " Allah , magnify , " Brun , " ununderstandable , " ecraft God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But the problem is coming the day after the dancing dancing , and you 'll find out that they 're the 11 of the morning of Marteday , and I 'm going to go out and shark it on 't .
It 's just a mortal with bad gran to the ginoccurred , and maybe it 's not going to be able to get to that height .
And maybe no one will sing one name of God still as well as , and what has to do is doing with his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painheronciliations to do in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angosh , if you can 't believe , indeed , for the most extraordinary aspects of your being from yourself .
But you just believe that 's a further of this source of a source of this squisite part of your life that you have to get to somebody else when you 're finished .
And , you know , if we think it 's all about it .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly like this , and it 's a lot of the book that I 'm going to publishing up , the dangerous , spaper , spectackage , I 'm going to be able to do it .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel elected by this is , not having afraid .
Not to go . It 's just your work .
Continua to introduced for your part , whatever could be .
If your work is dancing , balance .
If you divine , lisurd genius to do a decide to leave some kind of wonderful wonderful , for one moment through your efforts , just through your efforts , " So ! "
Otherwise , you do the same .
And " Ole ! " " at yourself .
I think I think I 've got to teach it .
" Ole ! " to yourself , even for the same , for having lots of human lots to make you continue to present continuously .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I 've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , what is the discovery of new genes .
Now we 're starting a new way : we started to digitalize biology and now now to go from that digital code , we 're going to a new phase of biology , designing and synthetizing life .
We 've always been trying to get big questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists , I think they 've been trying to understand and livels .
We 've tried different approaching it , reduced to the minimes .
We 're digitalizing for almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome , it was treated to go from analogical world of the computer world .
We 're going to ask us : we can regenerate life , or create new from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genome , which is the smallest genome that can autorem into the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a even smaller .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of the 10,000 that I 'm here .
But when we 're a look at its metabolic map , it 's relatively simple response to our .
Look , that 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at time , it 's very improbable that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to provided that the only way to provided this chromosome so that they could be able to modify components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " Can we synthesize a chromosome ? "
It can be able to produce these big molecules that we never have to create before we could create before we could create before we do this ?
And , in case , we can make a cromosome ?
A chemist is simply a piece of chemical material .
The speed that we 're able to digitalize life is growing at exponential .
Our ability to writing the genetic code , instead of procredies rather slowly , but it 's improve .
And our most recent results that are taken on a exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process require a lot of pasages , beginning with a bioetic review before we began to first experiments .
But we found that that synthesizing DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that make small segments of DNA , the length of 30 to 50 length and it 's a degenerative process : the longer segment is longer , the herrors .
We had to develop a new method to assembly these fragments and run the errors .
And this was our first attempted attempt , to start digital information genome of Phi X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills .
We designed the fragments , actually , by the way , recorrection of errors and get a molecule of DNA , about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material inert , and we put it into the bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and producing viral code and producing viral particles .
The viral particles have been required by the cells , are back and they destroyed the E. coli .
I 've been talking about recently as a membrings of the oil industry , which they have certainly compressed this model .
They have been more than you .
We think this is a situation where software can actually build his own own own hardware in biological system .
But we wanted to do things in big .
We wanted to build the whole thing that is ,
I 'm over 580 thousand letters of genetic code .
So we thought we 'd build it in seven of the virus , so that we could change the casses of the virus , so that they 're the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard accurately was a mistake for every 10 thousand .
We discovered , recently , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence of it , we would never be able to be able to work .
One part of the process is to design long segments that are about 50 letters that are overwhelmate with all the other segments of 50 letters to build subunits of smaller than working together .
We try to give the only one here .
Probably , you 've read that we put on the physfied .
Think of that : we have a genetic code four-based code .
Three of those letters together code about 20 lots , and there 's a specific order to address for every advance .
So we can use the genetic code to writing words , fragends , thinking .
What we did is , we 've done in the beginning .
Some of them are sitting that it was not poem .
We designed these segments to just joined them to just joined them .
There are enzymes that repair them and put them assime .
And we started assemble to the parts , beginning with five to segments from segments , unended up to segments of 24 miles letters , and they 're going to get to 72 thousand letters .
We have these segments in abundance , so that we have to sequencing them out of sequencing them out of creating a extremely robustood -- as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to authoratizing the process .
So , this seems to be the tabellon a basketball .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 thousand low low low low low low low , they 're not going to grow more directly in the E. coli .
It 's coming to the limit of modern tools of the molecular biology .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called homologue recombination , which is in biology to repair DNA can une the DNA can undry segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiation , it can absorbing three million rad rads .
You can see in the superior as the superperhigh as his chromosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it 's exactly as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms are completely .
They can live under vacuum .
I 'm really sure that life exists is exists in space , and you know , and you could find new riches of water environments .
In fact , NASA , showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we 've built these processes , simply using the light-of-insert design appropriate .
The least assemble them automatically .
This picture was not taken with a electronic microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It 's a molecule that we can see it with a microscope with a law .
These are picture that they cover a time of about six seconds .
This is the publishing we 've done a little time ago .
I 'm over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the biggest molecule than a defined structure of the defined structure .
It 's got a molecular weight to 300 million .
If we 're going to get it with a 10 without spaces , we would take 142 pages , it would just take 142 pages to transport this genetic code .
Now , how do we do that ?
Of course , I do a virus is a game of kids .
It 's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It 's easier when it 's simpler , as it 's eucariote as our : you can just extract the nucleus and put another , which is basically the clonation process .
In the bacterium archaea is instead of integrated inside the cell , but we have recently demonstrated that we 're able to do a transplant transplant from one to another and activity .
We could refed a cromosome parting microbial species .
two are different as humans as a mouse .
We have added gene some of the way that I could decide that I could decide to choose for this chromosome .
And then he skied with the enzymes so that we kill all the proteins .
And when we put it into the cell of it was study -- and we 're appreciate our sophisticatogist -- the new cromosome of cell .
And we started thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we 've tried to spinhering more in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms .
We discovered that so many species have added a second or a third , a second or a third , adding in a thousands of new tracks to that species .
So who think about evolution as only gene at the time that it 's not a lot of the biology .
There is a lot of the enzymes that even restriction that they 're digerisn 't going to be able to diger-the-DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell of it doesn 't have one .
The cell phone that we 've got inserit-mosoma we 've got it .
It 's expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome , as a material material , and we were rhythic with only the cell and the new chromosome .
It 's become blue , because of the genes we put .
And in a short leave of time , all the characteristics of a species , and it 's transformed of all the way , and it 's transformed into a new species , that we 've been insert in the cell .
All proteins are changed , membranes are changed , and when we read the genetic code exactly what we 've been transfer to what we 've been transfer .
Now , this might look at genetic , but we 're going to get the software , but we can do DNA to change things in a way of sustaining things .
Now , I 've been explained that here is not talking about genesis -- but for progress to three million years and a half years of evolution , and I 've said that maybe we 're to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion , where they 're going to be created new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's obvious when we think about our need .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give you an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 ; there 's four , there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicinal and gas for six billion and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more training to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , over 30 billion oil , over 30 billion baries .
That means percent of the day .
When we try to find biological processes , or whatever kinds of process to reduce them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to hold all the hemixed of CO2 from these materials that ends in the atmosphere .
At day , thank you to scientific discovery in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they 're the components for the future .
The electronic industry , just at a dozen about components , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limits here are limits here is a very biological data and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these methods methods , that we call a combinatory genomics combinatory .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million cromosomes that can produce a day .
Think about the 20 million genes or to try to get the processes or to try to produce either optanks or drugs , new vaccines , and we can change , through a small team , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology .
And it 's simply a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , production of emistry , production of etc , chemistry , production of etc vaccines .
This is an instantaneous instantaneous instantaneous , that we 're working on to be able to seat and design species to the computer .
Well , we don 't need to know , as well as they 're going to be .
We know exactly what they 're genetic code .
Now we 're focusing on carbon dioxion .
You also see that that they 're extract ethanol from the grate experiment .
We have fuel fuel and third generation that are pretty soon as soon as much as soon as as optan , or different kinds of butan-value types of butan-in-in-in-to-value types .
But the only way biology can have a big impact of the food and limited to increase the consciously of food and limitate the limitate of the food and limited to be able to transform CO2 in matter , so we 're working on for for design cells that can make this discovered , and we think we could have the first carbon as generation in about 18 months .
The light sunlight sunlight with CO2 is a metodownstroke -- but in our discoveries around the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the ocean , about 2500 feet of depth of depth water temperature .
They methane from CO2 , using hydrogen molecular as well .
We 're trying to understand if we can meet the CO2 , which can be easily be transansported by transmitted tubes , convert that CO2 in carbon , to drive this process .
So , we think we could be able to increase what we could be able to increase what the basic question is what is life is Nice , versus -- we have the objective mod-a-a-chemistry .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where can you ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And we 're working on using the same methods to create high vaccines .
You saw this year with flu , we 're always back a year , and with a dollar in less when it 's found a year , it 's going to find the fair .
I think that this is going to change by combining vaccines in a place .
This is how the future would start to look at the time , to look at the evolution of , accelerating the evolution with synthetic evolution with synthetic evolution , archadies , and finally incelluus .
We 're so on the best people .
Our purpose is to do so . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'm going to show you , the most fastest possible possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we 've taken to Microsoft in a year ago , it 's Seadragon .
This is a environment that you can interact is local level that remotion with a huge amount of data .
We 're seeing here , so we 're seeing a very digital picture with a kind of zoom stant , and continuous , for a panoramic speaking , deaths of the images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these are collected or images or images .
Most of them are digital photographs , but this is a scanning from the Biooo of Congress , and reentertained in the gamma of 300 megapixel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , example , not a data book , not images .
This is the Casa desolate Casa . Every colonna represents a chapter .
And to show you that it 's just about textbook and not images , we can do something like that , to actually make something like that , to actually make a real representation of the textbook , not a picture .
It could be a little way artificial to read a book electronic book .
I don 't consider it .
This is a more realistic example . This is a number of the Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of a magazine , or a quote , which is for nature or a neat , which is for nature a lot of a half .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We 've created a fasulla ads to higher solutional resolutionary -- much more than that you use in a normal publish . And we put it on the extra content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even the specific specific cheese .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminating the limits of space on screen .
I hope that this means to put up to the pop-up and other porcheries , and other porcheries , not had to be able to be .
Of course , mapping is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if we don 't say that we have contributes to this camp .
These are all the streets in the United States , whatever you have a geospatial picture of NASA .
So , we 're going to be at something else .
This is actually alive from the web , you can go to the web ; you can see it .
This is a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research as a very interesting research at Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Sheliski .
And it 's from Seadragon , gesture by Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this pattern , where we can go from an image to the other thing , and have this kind of experience to multiple and have this kind of experience .
But the space collocation is actually a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization computers have recorrespond to these images together , so that they correspond to places in real lags , so that the picture -- all of these things that pictures -- all of the Roccious recorded on the Montagne Roccious canad-st-st-stable show , and these things are all related to a stand-stand-stand-stand-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-and-store stagne .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Noahhhahs -- and this is from a previous prototype of Photosynthrow -- to show what I think is the key behind this technology , the Photosympheth . And it 's not necessarily evident to look at the environment we put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and forth .
This is a reconstruction of Notre Depicture of the Notre of Dr. Baast : I 'm going to types of Dame in Flickr and you get images in the shirt , other campus and so on . Each of these arancions , which is a picture of the arancions represented a picture that 's discovery that 's discovery .
So , they 're all images from Flickr , and they were all connected to this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this way simple .
You know , I 'd never have thought I 'm going to go to Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying this kind of accounting here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of photos : from those phones to the professional phones to those SLR , a meaning number , must together in this environment .
And if I can do it , I 'm trying to try to look for those strange .
Many of them are block , etc .
Somewhere you 're going to be a serious photographs -- here it it is .
This is a Notre poster of Dame recorrectly .
We can go from the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the interdead of the collective memory of how to appear , from vision -- and you connect all those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , greater than the sum of parts .
You have a model of the entire that emerges .
Think about this as a prolungment of Stephen Lawler 's work on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as well as people use it , and the people who are using it for the use of the use .
Their picture are married with other people .
If somebody is , you know , you know , the idea of these saying the name , my picture of Notre of Notre Dimproviously , you get suddenly arrich , and I can use it as a point of indoor to the insudden immerger in that metaphing , in that metaphor , in that metaphor , in that metaph-moed social experience of cle-mobile red experience of cle-moon-like social , and you can use a crather .
Of course , a consequence of all that are virtual models of the earth , which is no solved in the earth , it doesn 't just as open as open-like images and satellitarian images and similar , but from the college memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software will be able to do is that at a point , in the next few years , all the photographs , all the photographs , they 're going to be related together ?
BAA : Yeah . What he 's doing is actually discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , among images .
And it 's doing it in the basis on content of images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about cequipment of semantic information that 's semantis that many of these images that are able .
As when you do a research of images on the web , you 're a sentence and the web textbook has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what if that picture is that picture to all your picture ?
So , the amount of interconnection and quantity of wealth that is really enormous . It 's really huge . It 's a classical classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the major pleases when you travels and one of the etnographics of the ethnographics is the power of living in the wind , between the wind , the wind of the wind , touches in the wind , drives in the wind , driving in the wind , drives in the wind , days , driving it into the wind .
Basti thinking that sciamani Jaguar travel even beyond the Via , or that the old Milky of the Inuit , or that in Himalayas , the buddies are still dedicted the breath of Dharma , to remember the major breath of the anthropology , and that the idea that the world that we live in no sense , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of adaptations that our own stroke has done , good or bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
All of it . All we try .
We 're subjects at the beginning .
We have to deal with death inesorability , so we don 't surprise and we can take and ballize --
We all have a art .
What hits is the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of dance ,
Not that they 're the thinker of the Borneo , or the follows of Haiti , or the follows of Haiti , or the desert Kenya Shececececentriers , or a wild in Kenya , or a cammouth in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey in the desert of a month ago , or a yak hasides of the Qomolangal , on Everest , the mother of the world .
All of these populations teachers are teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of music in the world .
And , if you think a second , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
And together , my cultures of the world creating a spiritual ragnature and cultural life that has volved the planet and it 's important for the well-being on the planet as the planet as the ragela of neighborhood as a biological note as biosphere .
And you can think about this ragnature as a ethnos-like ethnos-sum , and you can define ethnosatic sum of all the concepts , dreams , ideas , inspirations , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions ,
The ethnosphere is the patrimonary of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be as a species .
And because the biosphere was free consumed as well as it was as ethnosfer and unfortunately much .
No biologist , for example , it would say 50 percent of all species has been , or is on the horle of the simply extinction because it 's false , or -- in the most apocalypocalypocaly-like biological diversity -- and you don 't even get close to hypothesis -- that of the cultural diversity .

When you 're born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just by a vocabulary vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the pattern of human spirit .
It 's the middle of every culture is coming in material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a bacine , a bacine thinking , a spiritual ecosystem of spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we 're here sitting here in Monterey , at least half , it 's not sudden in the ears of children .
They 're not teaching kids , which means , as it means , unless than not something , which they 're already dead .
What is more sad than being like , the last silent , of being the last to talk to a language , not haven 't so able to transmitting the wisdom of handing , or ancient promise promise honey , or to promise the children ?
This is a faight for someone in the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a slightly of the world every two weeks , a hard sets in the later syllabe .
And I know somebody who will say , " Isn 't that better ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we 're all the same language ? " Well , we 're talking to all yorba .
Let 's talk kogue .
You 'll get a tracks of what it means is not to talk about its language .
I 'd like to do a journey through ethnosfer --
a little journey in ethnosfer to give you a little bit of what we 're losing .
Many of us forgotten that when I say , " different ways of exists to exist , " I mean , "
Let 's take for example , this bomber Barasana , in Amazon , the anaconia of anacongue , which credies to come from the river of sacres in the sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacred sacres .
It 's a popular that it 's not able to distinguish the blue color from the green because it 's time , as a celests is identified in time , where the popular .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial , detailable " exogamia " " " You have to marriage a different language .
All of that radical in the past , though the partnership , is that in these exists that are talking about six or seven languages that are talking about six , and seven language of mystems a language .
They 're just to listen to listen to .
Let 's take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waorani of Ecuador Ecuador , a populum that has been the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have taken a commodities .
They did come up from the photographs that were in a few of adires that were in a population , forgotten that this population population had never seen anything that 's about bi-dimensional .
They 've been collected pictures from the Earth , they 're taking research on a form or a figure and , not in finding nothing , they 've got the reaching , and they have killed the five missionaries with the lance .
But the Waorani don 't killed only to the strange of the aniers .
They killed with them .
54 percent of mortality was caused by themselves .
We 're rising at eight generations and we found two natural cases , and when we insisted to know , they have admit to know , they 've been invited to know , they had a lot of them . And they had a lot of knowledge . And they had a lot of knowledge of the forest .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal hunters of 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the first 1980s , I was assigned a very interesting task when my professor of Harvard asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to Haiti to haiti me to Haiti and Macougment in the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and imsed Macoutes , and imsessing me in the first place .
And to give myraulous myraulous , I should understand the Vodoun culture , and that Vodoun 't magic .
It 's pretty much about a complex metaphysical vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianise , Islam , Budddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has not had religious . And instead of these religious concepts of these very profound religious concepts of these very profound religious concepts in deep tragic concepts in slavery .
What makes the voodoo voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , you know , you know , the spirits .
Pls can be invited by the Great Acqua , they respond to dance of dance and replaced temporary soul of the vive way that for a brief across the way that for a brief across the goal of the follows is the goal .
And so , for that voodooists love to say , " You know , white , you know ,
We say in the temple and we have God . "
And from the moment that you 're going to be , is the spirit that you can do the bad ?
So you 're seeing these incredible events : following voodoor in state of trance that touching infuel demonstration rather than the body that 's catalyzed demonstration , when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme extreme , when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme extreme ,
And at the populs with which I lived the most extraordinary is the Kogi of Sierra Nevada de Sierra Nevada , Santa Marta , in Colombia sector .
Take the ancivilization of the ancivilization that once they live loads on caraibic planning , the population of the vulcanical statement , population was on the vulcanical massive playwell-up players .
In a macky continent macky , this popular popular , this was never conquered by the spagnology .
And now they 're government from a clero , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people follows come away from the family to three or four years , and they live secreged in a world that they live in a good world and shares in a couple of years .
Two periods of nine years of proposed to reproduce nine months of gestation that they spend into the user of mother , now I 'm metaphor , they 're now metaphor in the Great Mother .
And so , for all of the time , they 're acculturated to their society , values that they predicted that their predicted , and only their predicted to their own prayers -- or to say the balance , or to say the balance .
Al terminal , this incredible began , they 're improviviously taken out and for the first time in life , at 18 years , they see a high . And in that account of consciousness , when the sun lies the beautiful valley , when the sun lies of beautiful landscape , all that they 've learned in this splanding , and says ,
" Yeah , I 'm like you .
It 's study . Now it 's about you .
They 're called the most of the destruction fratels and say that we , we 're the holds of destruction .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the ingene populations and the environment , and the old story of the noble noble self-vagage , which is a razy concept in its simplicity or perhaps in the war of us .
The Ingenius is not feeling in nostalogy .
There 's no space for these things in malaria in malaria or vent vines in the gelids of the Tibet , but through the time and they created a mystical mystical intuition , but on a bit of the Earth 's basis on a war that they can only be in closer , but on a by-such as well as a beautiful way , it 's under , because it 's infected by human-consciousness .
What does that mean ?
It means that a little boy of Ande that grow mountain that the mountain is a spirit Apu that will drive his destiny is going to be a destiny different relationship and it 's going to have a different relationship with the mountain or that place , and it would answer a little bit of the Montana , and it 's going to be shown .
That 's the dimora of a spirit or a mineral or mineral is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that define the report between individual and natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Britannica Britannica credating that the forests served to be cut .
And that was made me a human being a different human friends from my Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the Hukuk and the short of paradise and the paradise of paradise and spirits that live on the extreme extreme , spirits that we 're dealing in the beginning Hukukuk .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start understand some of their sensitive discoveries .
I took this picture to open in the north-doctor Amazon .
Mayahuasks , the most powerahuasks , the most powerful substance of the sciamanic repertoilet 's do .
What makes fascinating plahuasks the playahuasks is not the physical potential of the substance , but its result . It 's two elements .
From a hand , this leth-of-carboline , harmine and harmmm-molioline , harmine and mills , slightly hallucinogeny .
I take the only plant , you have a blue smoke that he 's a little bit of consciousness , but it 's mixed with the leaves of a family tape of the Psychotria sland-said , switchotss of re-slide ,
This is a tripsts , very similar sent , very similar to serotonin , dead degree methoxylenyplyplyplyplyplaptop .
If you 're going to see Yanomami , you know , you know , the sustainances that make from a different set of species , anchsy , it 's examine .
And so , polly-a-swap is a little bit like being disappeared by a fire walking and landing on a sea of electricity .
I had often I often , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who had taken the psychedelic was , with his discovery of fungi hallucinogens in the ' 30 in Mexico .
I 'm going to do it , I don 't get these triplotamines like hallucinogens because if you can 't tell any one of being hallucinated . And they can 't tell you . They can 't tell you that they can 't be hort . They can 't have been slightly because they 're in a naturally inside the intestine , detailed by the way , detailed by a monoxious monoxy-oxist .
It 's possible to be absual , if you 're just taking with other chemicals that denaturate the MAO .
Now it 's now the beautiful : : the drags that are in this liana liana are injumps of MAO , the same kind of need to potential . The question is that 's such a spontaneous 80,000 species of plants , like these popular popular son-based deaxed , but that if you combined this way , create a version of biochemistry that is on high high high high high high ?
We use the great euliar hemistake , which can be unvehicle , which can be unvehicle .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " The plants are talking about . "
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , the cofan , 17 varieties of the inguys , which are nership in the forest , and that our eyes would be would be in the same species .
If we ask them as they 're going to stage their tasonomy will tell us , " I thought about plants , you know , you don 't know all the way ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take 17 varieties in a night , and each night to be a little bit of a little bit .
With that you don 't have a lot of interesting to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that contact the stames .
Now , [ , ] the problem is that even those of us who have heart people who have heart people who have heart hours in the history of the story of the story of our real world , and pass .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it 's not reminded for its wars or its innovations , but rather as the technology , but rather as the era that we have hug and activity of the planet . It 's actually taking activity of biological diversity of the planet . Now it 's not the change .
All cultures through the several have been involved in a dance for new chance of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux didn 't stopped to be Sioux when they put out of it and flights as Americans don 't stopped to be Americans when they put out of Americans and calated .
It 's not the change or technology that they minaccounts the integrity of ethnosfhere .
The hard fly of domination .
And if you look at the world , you 'll find that these are not cultures that they are not cultures .
They 're creatures and dynamics spints out of identifable existence that are beyond that they go beyond their ability to adaptation .
And that 's what it 's disboscaring in the patria of the Penan --
a popular noy-asian popular , in the southwest , a popular who has lived to the forest to a generation , and now reduced to the servitof-services , where you can see the inquinated rive revenume that seems to be able to the rive re-half a hand-half a hand-half a quink .
taking the sts of further to the wooowner .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that are coming with the discovery of the golder .
If we move on the mountains of Tibet , where I 'm doing many research , you 'll see the hard of political domination .
As you know the genocide , physical extinction of a popular , is condanned to universal level , but ethnocide , destruction of the lifestyle , not just is condition , but it 's not just convicted , but it 's part of the development of the world , because it 's part of the development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet of the Tibet until you 're part of the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in Western China in Western Tibet , coming to Lhasa with a young agreed , but just came to Lhasa with a young , I realized what 's behind is that we feel about .
6,000 sacres sacred in sacres and holding .
1.2 million people killed by the military military people during the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was absolutely to the Panchen Lama .
That means that it 's been killed to the time of Chinese invasion .
His , it 's smoke with Sua Santity during the diaspora that he 's taken the population in Nepal .
His mother was impresoned and her color was to be rich .
It was taken to hidden in two years of hidden under his gonna because it would not live in his own .
And the sister , who did the same , was a reeducation camp .
One day has been walked up a day , a mothly fastheless Mao and , for this transgression , has been mention for seven years .
The pain of Tibet can be insopportable , but the reinside of the popular is from the popular .
And finally , all you reduces a choice .
We want to live in the world monocromatical world or we want to acking the policed world 's policed or the policy of diversity ?
The big anthropology Margaret Mead , before he die said that his greatest fear was that , in our going to go to this love vision of the world , not just see the whole game of human imagination , but one day we 'll see a modality of thinking , but one day we 'll be swake up from a sonnote , but one day we 're going to be able to sonnote that they were able to be able to .
And it 's humiliating our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Neolitical Revolution , who gave us the agriculture , which has made us to the cult of seed cult , and we 're going to replacing the skie with prosis , by creating the gerarching of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has 300 years .
That 's not about this shares not suggests that we have the answers that we 're going to face into the millennia to come to the millennia to come .
When these miric myriathes of the world is asked what it is to be human , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
And that 's in these answers that we 're all risky the chance of being what we 're : a consciously realization , that has to make all the people and all the gardes can be floating .
I took this picture on the north-the-handed picture on the island of Baffin , when I went to the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , he tells me the wonderful story of her grandfather .
The canadly government has not always been gentle with the Inuuit and in the ' 50s to stage our super-stage , we 've resticed them in colonies .
The grandfather to go there .
The family , I 'm afraid to her life , and took them all the arms , and all of his attacks .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn 't themselves the cold ,
The wild wild bad sled-bad skin .
The grandfather than this man didn 't intimid-night or the library , or from the library that suffering .
It 's gathered , it 's hot the panalyzed pattern and defected into your hand . When the hand . When the phoes are congelated , they 've been making a moama .
He spred on the door of this crap , and when I solide it , he 's got a dog .
He showed up the dog , and he created a shark , with the cass-bunch , and he 's imbridge a sleth-up on the banksa , and it 's disappeared on the bankners .
We want to talk about cavarrator with anything ? [ Rism ] . ] And that , in different ways , [ Apausi is symbol of the resilience of the Inuuuudience of the world .
In the 1999 , the canadly Inuit re-given the total government has revenue of the greatest area of the greatest California and Texas message together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's a dependent territory . They 're all the minerary resources .
One splator example of how a nation-state can recognize with his popular .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious at least to who of us was in these remote zones of the planet , remote that they 're not affected .
For someone is house .
They represent sections of human imagination that are taking at the high high high high holding us of these kids , as the dreams of these kids , becomes part of the hope .
And to finish , we have National Geographic we convinced that politicians will never get to nothing .
We think polemies --
[ Applausi ] don 't they , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every mothers our website .
156 countries transmitting our television canal .
Our revision are literally to millions of people .
Our work is traveling in ethnosfhere to bring our audience in places of wonders that they 're going to go away from how they 're going to go away from how they saw and hopefulticultural reveation of the world , the world of the anthropology of the world : the deservous world in a pluralistic world 's lifetime .
where the wisdom of all popular can contribute to our well-being contributing .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I 'm going to talk about this book that I hope to reach some of you 've already heard and I 'm going to try to try and try and connections to them .
I want to start with what I call the dogma dog .
The dogma official dogma of what ?
The dog official dog of all the industrial societies . The dogma dogma official dogma : " If we want to massimilar to our citizens . "
The reason is , from a handle , in fact that freedom is in itself a value , is , useful , as a beautiful , is , useful , essential for human beings .
And the other is that if we 're free , each of us can act for all that we can act to do everything that massiasking our benth , without one that decided to our well-being , not one that decided to our own .
The way to massimilar to the freedom is massize the choice .
More choice people , more than people are , and more are free , and more is their well-being .
This , I think , it 's so deeply radicated in society that no one would have to put it in doubt .
And it 's also deeply radical in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has been possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly great .
I 'm going to put a simple note on conditivae .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditivesting , without content oil and 12 varieties of oil and 12 aceps and 12 aceps balsamic number of conditivests that no one of the 175 huge number of your weapons of your weapons to be able to your degree .
This is what supermarket .
And then you go to the electronic store to buy a stereo : Clector , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio , like , printed .
And in this single electronic negoties , there 's a great number of components .
We can do six million and a half of different combination using the components that there are only negoties in one store .
You have to admit that there 's a lot of choice .
Other , the world of the world of the communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the phone services of the phone services that were forned by mom Bell .
And he was doing the phone , I didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , between the phone was that the phone has never break .
These days are gone .
We have a variety of phones , especially in phones , especially between phones .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cut of naso , and the bees of the bird , and forth for the crash .
If you don 't seen it in the negotie in the negotie , you 're going to be able to get .
And what happens is that people enter in the stops and do this question . And you know , what is the answer ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the purpose of the purpose , is the same choices explosion of choices .
Auxist healthcare : it doesn 't happen in the United States that you go out of doctor and doctor , you have to say what you have to do .
Instead , I go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , could we do A , or B , " has these benefits and these risks , " B has these benefits and these risks . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Does , what would I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , and B has these benefits and these risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you can do that ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not her . "
The result of the result of the malth , expression that he does a look good thing .
But it 's actually not that a move the fish and responsibility to make decisions that can make something that something knows about , to someone else knows that nothing -- and almost of course , and it 's not in the ideal condition to make the real decisions of patient decisions .
There 's a huge marketing of drug products , direct people like me and you , that if you think about it doesn 't have any sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why we 're publishing them ?
The answer is that they want to doctor to ask us to do them to do it .
Something that is fundamental as our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this vision , " We don 't want to force children . We don 't want to give children . They 're going to ceat the right time . " We don 't herve identity to the right time . "
And we can reinventing how many times we do .
That means that every morning , at the morning , you have to decide that kind of person wants to be .
I 'm doing the family and marriage , a time time , a common time , it 's almost for anyone , it was that they were marriage to us , and he was able to give us the most possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when and , and not even when I 'm , and not even what to do after .
And it 's really to play .
I teach students very smart students , and I do 20 percent of work than a time .
And it 's not because they 're less weight , because they 're less diligent .
but why are they impensierited , you know , I should have this , " Would I wouldn 't I ? "
" Would I be marrier ? I have to think about before or the career ? "
I 'm interrogatives .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even though this impldn 't completely compassume that I liked and not to get a beautiful vote to my examples to my examples .
And they 've got to do that . They are questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl Sarl , because the technology allows us to work every minute , every day , from the corner of the planet , except that from Hotel Randolphotel .
And I 'm talking to , there 's a coroline , and I 'm not going to tell you that , where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work ? That 's that we have to keep in the moment , and if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son , and we can see our son , with the phone in a cell , Blackberry in the other , and the notetetextbook , and the noteteteaching .
And even though they 're all spent , every minute that we see our son son , we 're also asking the game , we 're also asking this called ? "
" I have to say that email ? "
And even when the answer is no , " all this makes the experience of your child , very different than that would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the things , and big things , big , and big things , materials and the lifestyle , life is a question of choices .
Obrought the world was this : Obuts , there were some chance , but it wasn 't a question of choice .
The world today looks like this : The dilemma is , " Is it a good thing , or negative ? "
The answer is , Shake .
We all sorts of the negative lights , so I 'm going to talk about the negative ones .
All this choice two negative effects of people .
The first , paradoxally , is that produces instead of liberation .
With options between which choose , it becomes very hard to do it .
I 'm offer a meaning example : a study conducted plans of voluntary pension-and-a-purpose plans .
A colleague has had access to the data of Vancide , the gigantic societies of the source of the degree of clients .
What she has discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offering in more , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 sources , there 's 10 percent of adesions , as it 's available as they are available only five . Why ?
Because with 50 funding on the floor , is maledly hard to decide , and the choice is remaining to the inmorrow .
And to questions , and I 'm still asking , questions , and of course , and questions , and of course , I don 't get .
You know that doesn 't mean that only these workers are going to be hath food for canoes , because they 're not going to say that the decision is so ostics that they 're so ostics that they lose the funding is so ostics that they 're also dealing the funding of work .
Not participating , they 're losing to five to 1,000 dollars for the work dator , which would be well as a real disspoke to them .
So , the paralysis a consequence of having too many .
And I think it 's going to be like this .
" And finish , for eternity : ketchup , senaps or maionese ? "
You just want to take the right decision , if it 's for ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the bottom , and you can 't want to choose the wrong condition .
So , this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoid the paralysis , and we 're going to do a choice , at the end of how we would be with less options between what we would have been with less options between which I had to .
And that 's for different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditivested , and it 's not perfect , it 's not perfect , it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that would be better . And what 's going on is that the alternative imagined us industry , and the revenue of choice , and the revenue of the choice , and the recognize it takes a free free fastern ,
And even when it was a good decision .
More choice , you know , the most is easy to dispileverage than any tremendous than option .
And there is what economist-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert assume as well as a value that we do things about the value that we 're depends on what we 're comparing .
In the rest , when there 's a lot of options , it 's easy to represent the characteristics of the option of option that is choice .
Here 's an example . I school with all of the people who are not New York .
But that 's what you probably think about .
There 's this couple to the Hamptons .
A place of luses .
Spiavails . Otthday . It 's all about them .
Not nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , malth , it 's Augost . "
" All my neighbors to Manhattan is . "
" I could talk about front of home . "
And it 's two weeks , by the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the chance of parking , where it wants .
The constood is decreases the satisfying for what we have , even when choice was excellent .
And more are the options that we have to consider , the more of the characteristics that are going to be able to reach as expensive opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things .
It 's about living the moment , and maybe living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you do , you know , you know , you know , you know , you 're going to do the other .
The things that we don 't choose have a lot of active attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : it 's growing wth of expectations .
I tried it on my skin beating a new pair of jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
And once the jeans were just like , buy them and bought them and wild vestivestivestivested , they were moved , just after having them a lot of times , they began to go well .
So I went to buy a new when those old were , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my wrong . "
The committed told me , " He wants to slim , easy fit , relaxed hit ? "
He wants to the certain or with the bottons or with the bottons ? "
" Do you want to strapped them ? "
" Sotto them wants to be a hard , whatever bl -- " Continured to elencare .
I was sitting , and after a little bit , and after a little bit , I was able to say , " I want the guy , " He had no idea what it was , so for a time , I tried to all of jeans , I went out from the jeans , and then , with the best paair of jeans , I had the best jeans that I 've ever had .
It was the way . I got the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was worse , with all that choice , the myself is that with all of the aspectops were very high .
I started waiting for me . I didn 't expect anything except when there was only a guy , but when there was only a guy of 100 different , but when it 's been 100 different , at least a guy had to be perfect .
What I was bought , but I wasn 't perfect .
And after I had compared that choice with what I was trying to insatisfied in compared to expectations .
The addition of options in life doesn 't make the expectations that these have respond to the options of options .
And that 's going to produce less satisfy , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world marketing to be marketing .
Because if I knew it , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more like this .
" He was better when he was worse , " The reason it was better when he was worse is worse , when he was worse , it was still possible to meet surprised .
And in the world that we live in -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the expectancy of perfefefefefeatures -- massively that we can hope is that things are at the height of expectations .
You never surprised , because your expectations , my expectations , the myself is ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse expectations " Yes , " Yes , you want to . "
I mean , little car moment -- that I 'm really married and my wife is really amazing .
I wouldn 't do better , I don 't have a content .
But it 's not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of the buy jeans dissatisfacts when there is only that you 're not satisfacts , and you 're asking you , and you ask you , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? "
The world is responsible . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a lot of them , and you buy a lot of the insod-called you .
You 'd have been doing better .
With hundreds of available varieties , there are no scale for insuccessful .
So when people take decisions , even though the result is walking is walking , and they give the colcolors to them .
In the last few years , the last few years , is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- of this wave of depression is just that the depression of the depression of the depression of because the standards are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that colcolors are them .
So the final result is that we 're better better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me reminds you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than haven 't at all of it , but it doesn 't get a lot of choice is better than you can do it .
There 's a critical value , I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been doing our lives .
Now , from political point of view -- I 've got almost finished -- from political point of view , the political nocity .
What 's allows all this choice in industrial society is wealth material .
There are many places in the world , and you know about it , where the problem is not they have too many choice .
The problem is that they have too a little bit of them .
So the face of the face I 'm talking about is a malbeing exclusive of modern , remember societies .
And what it does to be angry and is this : Steve Levitt talked about how those expensive expensive and discovers to be inuseless .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dispendes , it 's not that they 're just unuseful .
I 'm a deleteries .
They 're worse .
If a little bit of what in our societies allows to choice was reversed in those where people have too few possibilities , it would be not only their life , it would be better . But our our own life .
This is what economists call a paretian improvement .
A refining refining refining , it 's good at all -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice in excess that we go back .
And to end , " Fild , you can become everything that you want , "
You , people of culture , you think , " What does it do ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make anything in a glass of glass . "
" A imagination castrated , a limited view of the world , "
and that 's what I 've interpret it so , at the beginning .
But then , I realized that that fish is the knowledge that fish is known .
Because the reality of fact is that if you eat the boat , so that , " all of it is possible , " You don 't get the freedom .
If you break the boat , so that all divent possible to decrease .
Let 's go and you get the paralysis , and you can get the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too , maybe for fish , and certainly for us .
But the axide of some symbolic symbolic symbolic sphere is a recipe for infected .
Thank you very much .
