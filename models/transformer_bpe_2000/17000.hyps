The year I 've shown these slide slide to show that the glacial calculation , which for almost three million years of years had had the United States of the United States continental , it 's recorded 40 percent .
But this subjects this subjects the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice .
The articy glacial calculus is , in a sense , the car system .
It 's wind and you revernor and you revernor .
The next slide is going to be a floor of the last 25 years .
The ice lost lost of gets are in red .
And as you see , you 're going to the blue .
That 's the ice in the winter , which you reverior .
You can see that the ice ice ice ice , the ice ice , five years or more , is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like the blood .
In 25 years , it 's spent by so ,
This is a problem because the internal scale , the whole land of the ice around the ocean arctic way there there are huge amount of coal congeled that , snake up from microbes .
I 'm going to spect to the totality of the atmospect of the global global warming , that might be doublew , superperforated this point of the world .
In some lands on the hi hi holding the metane is already rebuling from the water .
The professoresse Katey Walter Walter of Alaska , has rected with a team pressed with a team craft , I 'm going to winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : I 'm good . The question is , if we 're going to be us .
A reason is that this term that this term ratic exhibition of the North .
This is a river of glacial records .
The brought never reached levels .
This is the Kangerlushiaq , in the west South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South South , in the west west west west west river , in the west west west river , in the west of the Gre
If you want to know how the level of the sea level of the ice of ice of the ice of ice on terraferal terraferal , here is where to reach .
These corrings are increasing rapidly .
Another part of the planet : Antarcttarttttarm of the planet .
The month , the month have direct that the gative ancient is in negative , and that the Antarctarctarcttarctarcttarly in the sun-marine issue , is particularly rapid in the slower ss .
Equval to six meters of the floor of , like Greenland .
On Himalayas , the largest block of ice , you see new laghi , which few years ago were glaghi , which few years ago were glacier .
40 percent of the world population was half of the world 's population water from the wind .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the powerful water source of this city .
The brought is increased .
But when it dimines , the same thing is happening to the water .
In California , the news on the Nevada is 40 percent .
The background are in crisis .
The predictions , like you read , I 'm graves .
The growth secus in the world door to a night of the incends .
The environmental disasters are increasing out of the normal disprecedental and without precedental .
Four times more numerous number of years , over the last 30 years , the precedentently 75 .
This is a beautiful thing that is sustainable .
If you look at it in the stories if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the East area of the East Pacific area , from the Americas , and both west both parts of the sub-continent , where there 's a poor poor poor oxygen oceans .
The largest causes of global warming , and the deforestation , which is 20 percent of the ebustic combustiable fuels .
Oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And it was proposed to build a lot of other central coal .
But we 're seeing a change of direction .
These are annative projects in the last few years and some of alternative alternative versus .
And every way , there 's a politics in our country .
The coal industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year for promotion , which is a coal gooil , which is a bone .
And that image I remember something --
I 'm going to be Natale , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion liters of carbon dioxion .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the biggest second flow of scories in America .
It 's happened around the Natal .
The nature of the nature of one of the coal industry was this .
Video : Wide the carbon . â™« Frosty the kind of allegror and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it makes our economy .
Frosty the carbon is always more and more .
It 's a good price , adorable , and the workers are mantend to stay .
Al Gore : Al Gore : Al Gore 's a West Virginia .
The largest society is Massey Coal worler is Massey Coal . This is his amministrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'm going to be a clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Peloone , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Proteition of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is a part of it ,
Video : AcLergy : ALergy we see the climate change as a minacy of a minacy minacross the business .
So , this is our priority is investing a great amount of money in a force public force to make public truth and confused to the coal truth .
In fact , the carbon is not sport .
We think it 's not a good -- it 's also a good ,
So , not preocupateves of climate change .
Let 's do us .
Video : Ack : Ack , you 've heard a lot of it .
So , we do a glay in a structure of the way it 's about coal about coal ,
Straordinary ! The car ! The car is a little slander , but this is the sound of the coal technology of coal technology .
The carbon consumption is between the main global result of the global warming , but the technology of carbon technology , you know , the nice technology is all about .
You have a look at : this is the coal technology of coal .
Al Gore : I finally , the news is the positive connected to economic question the economic security and national security .
Video : The America is in the crisis : The economy , the national crisis , the national crisis .
The flows that the flows of our dependence on the fuels of fuel fuel , as the coal coal and the important coal .
Now , there 's a new new , car solution for using it .
Repower : 100 percent of energy , in the 10 years .
A plan to put the America to work , make sure us more secure , and help us stop the global warming warming .
And , inally , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
Repower America . Scool than you .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's about : It 's about re-giving energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to bring us to the dependence on the combustible combustiable that kill our planet .
So what it 's : The future is here . I 'm here , just one new energy .
So , what you know two : Noves investment for burn workers .
Comics : Repower America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old , I proverbio , says , " If you want to go fast , you go from the wind .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
The year at TED , I did a TED fectrodumption on the LHC .
And I promise to the nars to the way it works .
So , I have that there . And for the other time , there were no , the LHC is the greatest scientific experiment ever ever taken -- 27 kilometers of circence .
His the task is to remember the conditions that were taking the conditions of the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
All of this is just environment .
This is the Ginevra under Ginevra .
I was pictures these mini-Big Bang in the remarkers .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLALATLATLATLATLALATLATLATLATLALATLATLALATLAS is a diameter .
This is a spectacular image of ATLATLATLATLASShand , I 'm going to build the proportions .
10 tember year we have access to the last year we have access the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS .
It 's because it 's immense festegation in control .
It 's a picture of the first of particles that had made all the jumpy of LHC , both , both in collision , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles in the reator .
In other words , when we see that image 10 , the 10 tember , we understand that the car worked , which is a great vicicy .
I don 't know if it was this to be exultremely to be this , when somebody went on Google and saw that the beginning page was this .
That means we have a cultural impact on the scientific impact .
It was a week after , there was a problem with the car , there was a problem with this car , these dorders here -- these dored damn dored .
These files are 13,000 amps when the car machine works at the massive of power .
Now , the technical is between you look at the kids and say , " It 's not true . They 're too sound . "
And instead they can do that when they 're very cold slower challenge of challengers .
So , at least 271 degrees , at the inferior in the space between stars , these falling files can bring that corporate the corrent .
In one of the kind of the most of the nails of the magnetets in the LHC , there was a fect of fect .
So , the flows up , and the 13,000 printing printing meant that they met a electricity .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnetets more than 20 tons , and that you have been sitting about 30 centimeters .
They 're damage about 50 magnetets .
We had to take them to leave them , what we 've done .
We repristined and it 's going to be .
Now , they 're returning all the way .
I would be the end of marzo the LHC will be again .
We 're going to do this , and we expect to get to right data or slums or , and continue so our adventure to find what the morning is the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these critical accidents access the value of the value of the value of science and engineering in frontier . It 's easy to confun .
I think that it 's so hard , the fact that it 's so hard to go beyond the value of things like LHC .
I 'd like to conclude with the words of a Inglens , Humphrey Davy Davy , which , I 'm saying , in the inuseful experiments of his puplease Michael Faraday , his own own own own minerature , and he said , " Nichael Faraday , " that the ideas of the ideas of the ideas of science , which is not about our workers in the way , which is not us . " which our monkeys are the new monkeys in the way , and the way of the world 's a complety . "
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to think about when , children , from children , play with the mormorning .
And I 'm going to realive them as you reach them , and you get them and move them , learn them and move them , learn to think and solve problems of the relationship to the relationship of space space space .
The reason is space , is deeply connected to the way we understand the world around us .
So , by information , from the information of our interaction with objects , together to my physical objects , and my consult Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask , I started asking up , I started asking a computer , instead of being the digital cursor , instead of being a descite , which is a computer , you could realize a desktop of the digital information with the information of the information ,
and we sistemareas ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the answer , building the Siftable .
In the words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer like a birth .
In the words , a Siftable is a big interactive computer like a birth .
You can move them with the hand , they can see the way , you know , the right movement and they have a screen and a radio radio screen .
But , basically , I 'm physical objects , like physical , you can just move .
The Siften is the example of a new ecosystem tools to ecosystem information .
And as they become more physical , conscious knowledge of the movement , and as they become more physical , conscious of the other people , of how we can explore new the other people , how we can explore new interaction .
I 'll start with some simple example .
This Sift-hand to show the video video : if you including it in a direction , the video running , video running .
These interactive riting are conscious of the other .
If you go to , they 're interested in what they 're going to them around .
If they 're surrounded , they noticed it and they can act a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , they noticed it and they can act a little bit .
They have their movement and inclination .
We realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power of interaction was the power of the data , for example , " a color like a color like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurated as a seck of vernice and I can use them to the color in the color in the color , where they mix .
and I can use them to bring them to the color in the central color , where they mix .
If we 're too much , we can reput a little place .
And you also have a beautiful possibility of approvide , like languages , the mathematics and logic logical things where people can try and see the results of the results , and you see the results of the immediately .
Now , I 'm going to --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a equations .
Here we have a word of words that is half of the Scarabeer and Boggle .
It 's all over , at every turn , you got a letter in the Siftable , Pratically , every turn out , every turn out of Siftable , and while certain who I 'm going to compories he 's going to a die on a diptionary .
And then , after about 30 seconds of the mixed , and you have a new set of lecting and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
So here 's children came in to the Media Lab , I 've been done that I tried them and I 've been tried to a video video .
They 're very much flew .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people many education .
You 've got to say , " I 'm going to say , " I 'm going to be doing .
So here 's the other people who try it .
This is our own text , right there 's the right there .
It really wanted to impact them .
They were just honces , for him .
Now , this is a kind of a interactive application .
We wanted to build a tool for the way to the languages of the languages is Felix .
It can inserious new characters in the scene , solving Siften their associated .
It can inserious new characters in the scene , solving Siften their associated .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is .
David Merrill : Now he brought a track in the scene .
Video : The arancient : The aranciation .
By work ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes !
So I was at Siftable and put up the neighborhood can be interact with characters --
Video : Bau !
And , inventing their story .
Video : Ciao : I !
DM : It 's a winal story with the final , and it can decide him how you svolge .
DM : It 's a winal story with the final , and it can decide him how you svolge .
Video : Video : I go .
DM : The last example I have the last example I have the time to show you is a tool , recently recently , to walk and expeding music .
It 's a tool , recently , to recently , to figure out and expedition to be music .
The Siften are going to the sound as well , basically and the bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose what we use .
And you can also , the inserious sounds in a sequence to your feet .
And it 's just further to make a sound , " and a sequence . "
These are actually that you can control from the vive , as the reverbs and the filter .
I 'm going to a particular sound and then including it .
And then there are the general effects as time and fly , which you know , and you know , the whole sequence .
We look at how it works .
Video : We 'll start to put a base in two Siftable , " sequence , " we put the scale , we put it in a series , we add the other base .
Now I put a bottom of the bottom .
Video : DM : Now , I add to the percussions --
Video : And now , I 'm going to put the filter , so I can control the effect from the vive .
Video : DM : I can fast the whole sequence inclinking the time by a hand or the other side .
Video : And I 'll add the phild to the low phild to the low phild to the flower .
Video : I can fight the sequence " to flight the sequence . "
So I didn 't have to plan it first , but I can improvising , rending it , rending longer or more cord .
And now , finally , I can fump the whole sequence inclining to the Siftable to the Siftable . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new interface , is building new interface , and more and more and the body .
And today , I 've been time to show you one of the result of this percord , and even some possibility that we try to bring out from the lab .
The concept that I want to spend is that there 's this new generation of objects for digital media media , which will bring information in our world in our world way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the hour to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writing .
I 'm going to writing books is my profession , and of course .
It 's also the love and the love of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , I said that , something particular happened in my life and my career , who took me to recently recently , that led me to remember the whole whole thing .
And the particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called " Manogy , Prega , Ama , " which , diversity from my previous book , for some reason that I was going to be a great , sensatisational , but I 'm a big , sensatisational , bestylies .
And the result is that everywhere now , people are now , people treat me as if I was condamn .
Do -- I 'm danned , conddamn .
They go from me now , everybody worry and say , " Don 't be able to be able to be better than doing ?
You don 't have to be able to writing for all life without more being able to create a book that can important book that can be able to create a book that can important book ? "
that can be important ? "
It 's rasinging , you know .
But it might go worse , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a adolescent adolescent -- I was a writing .
I went to meet the same reaction as the same as well .
And people say , " Don 't themes that I didn 't have success ?
Don 't you fear that the umiliation of killed you ?
You don 't have to be able to do this for all life without nothing that nothing came up and die on a heart of the mountain surgery of the damage of falliment with the falliment of falliment ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I have fear of all those things .
I always had fear .
And I also have a lot of other things that people could not have to be .
As the other things spent things .
But , as I think about the writing what I thought and I was asked to me , it 's why ?
It 's rational ?
It 's logical that anyone who has to expected by a work that you 've been switing to do .
But what 's this particular in the impress creative impress us nervous about health care about health care in a way that other career do not do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemist and I don 't remember a solar time in his 40 years of activities in which he was asked if she was asked to be engineer ?
It was never -- that block of the John , how do it ?
It didn 't work like this , you know ?
Onestly , the engineers like chemicals , they have no , in the secoli , driven the reputation of being high huge eat .
We writers , we have enough this reputation , and not just the creative , but creative reputation of every gender , we have this reputation of being huge mentally instable to be a huge instable of being tremendous .
And it 's not about the sad of the magnificence of the magnificence of the magnificence of creative minds that , just in the venture century , they died young and hands for them .
And even the ones that are not suicipate data that they look at their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , " Ogamn my book book kill my book kill book , " The amazing of their life .
But we don 't bad top , when we feel that because we 've heard these things that we 've been completely interized that some way we completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and the art , and that art , it 's going to be some of the art , and it 's going to be in the angoes .
And the question I want to bring all of here today is : you know , you know , with this idea ?
You know , it 's really -- because you look at the hundred of distance to me , it doesn 't be good for anything about this supposition .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's even dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated century in the next century .
I think it 's better to encourage our big creative minds to live .
And I 'm sure that , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start fire out of the supposition , especially drive to the circumstances in which I 'm in my career .
I 'm just just just looking at , I 'm pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I 've been about 40 years .
I 've got about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that whatever I 'm going to be right now to be judated from the world as the work that I was going to the end of my last book .
I 'm going to be slavery , because we 're all the friends of huge is to be my largest succeeded .
Oh , Gesus , who thought .
You know this is the gender of thinking that leads to a person who bringing a person to the nine in the morning , and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep to continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question is , how do it ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflections , which the way to work to keep up and writing is to create a psychological costruck , OK ?
I had to be a safety of security between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural anxiety on which reaction will be able to be . And , as I was trying to look at the time , and I was trying to look through the time , trying to find other society to see if they could have the best ideas and see if they could have the best ideas and sane .
about how to help people creative to make people creative inerent the risks of creativity .
And that research has brought me to the Great Rome .
And I 'm going to be because it gets back .
In the Great Great Rome -- people don 't seem to believe that the creativity was creativity from men , OK ?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit of the way they are men from the men from one of the source and swine , for reason , for reasons and discovered .
The grew of the creativines of the creativity of the creativity " demons . "
Socrate , wonderful , it was created to have a demon that elargives wisdom from the far away .
The Romanes were the same idea , but they called that kind of spirit that kind of spirit .
And that 's great , because the Romanes , because the Romanis not really smart that a genius was really smart .
They realized that a kind of entity of a devate kind of a devate in the walls of the studio of a studio , a little like the elpho of a artist Dobby , and that came out of the artest of the work of the artist of the work of the artist of the work of the work .
And it 's a nice -- here , that 's the distance of which I talk about -- that that psychological psychological that you protegets of your work .
And everybody knew that was that it worked , right ?
So , the antiwho were protected by certain things , like , as for example , as you 're too narcisymps , no ?
If your work was except , you could not take it all the way , all of the fact , everybody who had been helped by this genius to walk this genius .
If your fallide work , it wasn 't all your hit , right ?
And they all know that was your genius to be a way .
And so people han concept the creativity in Occident for a long time .
And then Renasciation came and everything is changed , and nacives this great idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe and measure and measure and measured space to the creatures that writing out of the divinity .
This was the major of humanity and people started thinking about creativity and people started thinking about creativity from hydivided .
And for the first time in the history , you start to refer this or that artist as a genius as a very , like a genius like a genius .
And I have to tell , I think that was a big herror .
I think that allow someone , a simple person to believe that , as a recipient as the source , the essence and the surgery of all the divines , creative , inoscient and a responsibility is a very big responsibility to the fragile humans .
It 's like to someone to ingoes to ingoes .
Deform and destores completely the ego and creates all these insummer wait on the performance .
And I think it was this pressure to the arts in the past of the arts in the past 500 years .
And , if that 's true , and I think that is , the question is , and now ?
Can we do it fun ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and measure .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't sell 500 years of thinking in a talk about 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people between the audience that solsolve would be suspected to scientific none , insound that they follow people to get people , and you do that people are going to be able or fell or of their projects .
So , I 'm not going to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to bring is -- why no ?
Why don 't think that way ?
Because it has more sense of anything else that I 've ever heard to explain the exaspering impreveilability of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever , all here -- you know , you know , you don 't understand it rationally .
And , in fact , it can sometimes completely paranormal .
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poetesh poetesh Ruth Stone , who has been a poetesh poetesh for all life and told me that during his childhood in the Virginia , working out in the Virginia , and he was working out of the winside of the Virginia , and he was just a little bit of the landscape .
He said that she was like a fragorous trends .
And that was rotate to her from the landscape .
He felt it was because he was to be able to be a tremendous way .
He was to have a solar thing to that point and it was , words , " rules like a major . "
And so it was going to home and he wouldn 't have to get the other thing that I had to take a piece of card and a craft enough , and a craft enough , while the traphion , and he was to collect it on the page .
Sometimes didn 't be fast fast , so that he was running and raise and won 't come home and the poem and the poem was rotated through and she would keep through the landscape , and he would continue to rotate through the landscape , and he said , " another poet . "
And then there were those times -- this piece of the piece of time , I 'm never going to be able to be almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running up at home and was trying to the card and the poem was through , and he was a willing in the washing , and then she said , what he was like to be smoungasse with the other hand and the winner .
He was the poem was poem from and the reput in his body and reped the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page , but the last word at the last word at the first word to the first word .
So when I think about it -- it 's a race , it 's exactly equal to my creative process .
I 'm not just a creative , I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a music , and my way to work is , and I 'm going to go to the same orary every day and I 'm going to go and go to and go up and pass us .
But even I 'm even in my head , I 've been striked against that thing , sometimes .
And I think that 's also a lot of you have the han fact .
You know , even if the work and ideas were ideas , and ideas that would be a certain source , I could not honestly .
And what is this thing is ?
And how can we relationship to it , it 's not to go to the head , but , rather , what do you do to remains sances ?
So , as I look at , the best example of contemporary example I have the Tom Waits , which I 've interview of the Tom Waits , which I interview of a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life has been the incarnation of the artist remarkable contemporary contemporary control , trying to control , dominate these species of impulses creative totally interior interior ,
But then I 'm going to invest , and one day as he was driving on a drive on a car in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
It was going to go fast and all of a tract of this little bit of melodia , which arrive in his head as it does does the inspiration , and it 's the way , you know , it 's wonderful , and it 's not how to take it .
It has no paper , it doesn 't have a math , it has a cyet .
So , I started to feel this kind of old , and he was growing up in him like , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'll remark obsessed by this song .
I 'm not pretty good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of go to the panic , I 'm going to stop .
I 'll be the whole mental process and he made something completely new .
I 'm just going to be the sky and said , " Do 't see , I 'm driving ? "
" You know , " Do you know , you know a song now ?
If you really want to existing , back in a moment more opposed when I can take care of you .
Atriminds , I won to important something today .
I 'm going to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process was working on this .
I don 't work , the work was still known as well .
But the process , and the weight that was releft when the genius was releft when the genius , the genius that was sitting up to where else that problems and liberated it to where it was , I 'm making that we had to be a whole thing that was , and recorded .
but it wasn this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange thing that along and this strange and external thing that allowed , and it was not Tom .
So as the story that I started changing a little bit about the way I was working on and already to me .
This idea , I was writing , I was writing " Manogy , Prega , Ama , and clean in one of those cave disperation where we 're working on something and we can 't start thinking about something and we can start thinking that it 's going to be a disaster , which is going to be a book , which is going to be a worse , which is the worst book , which is going to be written .
Not just bad , just the worst book written .
And I started thinking about gone this project .
But then I remember of Tom who talk about the air and I tried to the air and try .
So , I 'm going to go up in the manished and I rescued my fresses in the room .
And I said , " Do you know , " Where , what 's both , you know that if this book is not going to be brilliant , not be interly colliant , not be interacting to my , no ?
Because as I 'm just just putting everything I 'm , I don 't have this .
So if you want it is better , you have to presented you and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I 'm not further .
I 'm going to writing the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to do that I 'm going to be able to be my part of the world today , I 'm so , OK -- secoli ago , OK -- secoli ago , OK -- secolumed to the damage of the sllow , dances of the key , saying for hours and musical hourselves to the top .
And they were always magnific , because the balleras , and they were wonderful .
But every long , rarely , something happen , and one of these artists was actually transendent .
And I know what I 'm talking about , because I know you have seen that you 've seen , at some point , a way like this .
It was like time you stop , and the ballery walking through a kind of a bral bral branched , and she wasn 't doing anything about different from the smoke , but all of it was sitting .
And at the suddenly , it doesn 't really appeared as a human .
But it 's happening from the divinity and under the fuoco of the divinity .
And when this is , you know , the people who were all of the people who were called the his name .
They kay the hands and and started cancer , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God . "
That 's God , you know .
And I mean , the More invasy -- when the More invader the Spaper , I was this abitude with them and the pronunce changed in the cheat , Allah , Allah , Allah , " " " Olycle , " that you can hear in the corride or flamework .
In Spnday , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , " Allah , " Allah , " Allah , " I was , " I 'm going to understand , " I 'm a God .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem is the day after , for the ballery , when you wake up and discovered that I 'm 11 of Martedays and I won 't have more .
It 's just a mortal with ginock , and maybe it 's not going to be able to be able to be able to that altitude that altitude .
And maybe nobody will be the name of God still as it gets , and what 's to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painted recilizations to make in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angoscientist if you can 't believe , clear , that the most extraordinary expedition of your own being from you .
But it 's just created that you 're just going to be a further of this squisite of the squisite of your life that you have to get to somebody else when you 're finished .
And , you know , if we think that 's about this way .
And so I started thinking about , and it 's certainly as I thought for several months in the book that I 'm going to publicense , I 'm going to be able to be , spent , spent , I 'm going to be done .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I was electried by this is , not having .
Not to go . It 's just your work . It 's just your work .
It 's about inua presentation for your part , whatever , whatever it is .
If your work is balling , ball .
If the divine , I assurging up to you decide to leleave some kind of wonderful kind of wonderful , for one moment through your forced , then , " Over ! "
Otherwise , I do the same thing .
And " Ole ! " " You 're at the same .
I think I think it 's about to teach it .
" On the same , just for you , just for the human love and test love and test tells tals to get you continue to get you continue .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : On !
You know , I 've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , what can meant and the discovered of genes .
Now we 're starting a new way , we started digitalize the biology and now we start to digital biology and now we 're both a new phase of biology , design and synthetizing life .
We always have been trying to bring big questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many biological biological to understand vary livels .
We tried different approaches , reduced to the terms .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to spend from the analogical world of the digital world of computers .
Now we ask us : We 're going to regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest genome of the smallest genome who can self-laboratory .
And we tried to reduce the genome to the genome to create one more little .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of the genes of the way I 'm here .
But when we take a look at the metabolic maps , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
I think , that 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very unliving that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to provide this was synthetic cromosom to be able to be able to make some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " " We can synthetic a cromosom ? "
It can be the chemicals to produce these great molecules that we never could create before we can create before we have this ?
And , in case , we can make a cromosom , we can work a cromosom ?
A is just a chromosoma is just a chemist of chemist .
The speed with which we are able to digitalize life is growing exponential exponential .
Our skill , our gene code , instead , instead , rather than slowly , but it 's miles .
And our most recent recently recently recently , the exponential curve .
We 've been started more than 15 years ago .
The process has requires a lot of pass , beginning with a bioetic review before we 're going to the first experiments .
But we found that that synthetizing of DNA is very hard .
There are thousands of thousands of car in the world that producing little segment of DNA , long long lecting , and it 's a degenerative process : the lectest segment is longer , the more rors is , more rors .
So we had to develop a new method to make these fragments and record the herrors .
And this was our first tentative attempt , to start digital information of the genome of Phi X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills kill .
We designed the frments , we actually made the correction of errors and reached a molecule of DNA of about 5,000 lectal lectiny .
The part is the interesting part of the chemist of chemist of chemist , and we 've been insert it in the bacteria , the bacteria have started to read this genetic code and produces in the viral particles .
The viral particles are reflected by cells , are back back and they have the Ecoli .
I 've been talking about recently the oil industry and the oil industry and they have certainly compress that they have certainly compress this .
They have revolved more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build the same hardware in a biological biological system .
But we wanted to do things the biggest things .
We wanted to build the whole cromosom of the bacterium .
I 'm over 580 miles of gene code .
So we thought of build it in the seven of the virus of the virus , so that we could change the cassed cell cassed to understand what the components of a living cells .
The design is critical designing , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 accuration accuration was of a herror for every 10 miles .
We found , we found it , 30 herrors . If we had the original sequence , we would never be able to be able to be able to do that .
An the process is designing segments that has substantial segments that they have to be survive with all the other segments of 50 lectiny to build smaller underwater .
We try to do the only one elements here .
You know , you have read that we put that we 're going to put the physical figure out .
Think about this : We have a low gene code on four lectiny , C , GG and T.
Three of those lectures together with codifying about 20 amminoacids , and there 's a specific order to the lectest lectual lectest .
So we can use gene code to writing words , frures , psychemical .
What we did at the beginning was self-f-further .
Some of them were from the fact that it wasn 't a little bit .
We designed these segments to just just to be to unk with it .
There are there that they reputs them and put them together .
And we started to assemble parts , beginning with segments from segments , and we 've got to segments to make segments of 24 mile lect-foots to them up to 72 measure .
So , we 've produced these sequency in the abundance so that we 're trying to create a very very clear process of the building that we 're trying to see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatizing the process .
So , this seems like a tabellon of a basket .
When we go to these very long time , over these segments , more than 100 miles , they don 't grow more directly in the Ecoli .
It 's going to the limits of modern tools of the molecular biology .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We knew of another mechanism called the omologa , which is , in biology has used to repair DNA to reputting the DNA segments to sat the segments .
So , here 's a example .
This organism , called Deinococcus , it can absorbed three million rad of radiation .
You can see in the sudperior as the suddenly require .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly how it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do .
These organisms are completely seck .
They can be living under the vacuum .
They 're absolutely certain that life in space , and you know , and you know , to find new environments of water .
And in fact , NASA has shown that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built with these processes , just using the light-evidence with the property of the segments from insert .
The lists assemble them ,
This image was not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule molecule that we can see it with a microscope with a microscope .
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publication that we 've done a little time ago .
I 'm over 580,000 lect-points of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a definitely defined structure of the man .
It has a molecular weight to 300 million .
If we stammed with a 10 without spaces , there would like 142 pages , there would just 142 pages to transforming this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we acvent it ?
Of course , you know , you love a virus is a game of kids .
It 's a little more complicated when they use of bacteria .
It 's also simpler when it 's the eucariote as well as our : you can just extract the nucleus the nucleus and put another , which is basically the clonation of clonation .
In the bacteria , the archaea is integrated integrated in the cell , but we have recently recently , we 've recently demonstrated that we are able to be a bunch of a cell and activity .
We 've got a cromosoma parting from a microbial species .
The two are as different men from the men .
We add some gene genes in the most way that I could decide what I choose for this cromosoma .
The sciolden with the way to kill all the protein way to kill all the protein .
And when we put it in the cells was stupendocell -- and appreciate our sophisticatooos -- the new cell cell cell .
And we were really thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to spingeres more in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that many species have added to a second or a third hard or a third hard hundreds of a thousands of tracks in that species .
So who think about evolution as a gene at the time that you 're modies that has no free biology .
And there are the world of the restription called the restription of the digery of the DNA digery .
The cromosoma that was in the cells , it doesn 't have one .
The cell phone that we 've got to the cell that we 've got the .
And it 's expressed , and recognized the other chromosoma as a summer material , and we were returned out with only the cells and the new cell cell cell .
It 's blue because of the genes we 've been insered .
And in a short time , all the characteristics of a kind of time , and it has been transformed in the new species , based on the new species , based on the new species , based on the new species .
All the protein is changed , the membraning members are changed , and when we read the genetic code of the equivalent that we 've been transfer .
Now , this might look at the genetic alcheia , but we can be able to be DNA , we can change things in the way enough enough .
Now , I 've been explained that here is not talking about genesis -- but we 've been designed by three million years and a half of evolution , and I 've said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian , where they will be created on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's enough obvious when we think of our needs .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half billion in the next 40 years .
Right for example : I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each other , in 1946 , there will be four years .
We 're having problems now to find food , water and clean , medicinals and wells , medicine and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more draw for billions .
We put more than five billion coal , over 30 billion baries , over 30 billion baries of them .
That means millions of baries a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or whatever kind of process to reduce them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole of CO2 of these materials that finishing in the atmosphere .
At the day of today , thank you to scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the designed for the future .
The electronic industry , just just a dozen about components , and think of how many different things are coming out .
Our limitations are major data from biological and our imagination .
Now , we have techniques , thank you at these metods of synthetization , we can create what we call genomics fighting .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million cromosomes a million cromosomes a day .
Think about this 20 million genes or different genes or to try to get optimize the processes to produce optimize or , new vaccines , and create more biology , we can change , thank the most biology , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for possibility of survive , chemicals , production , chemicals , production of vaccines .
This is an instantaneous instantaney of some software programmed to be able to seat and design species to the computer .
Well , we don 't know what they 're going to be .
We know exactly what the genetic code .
We 're going to be concentrating on the fuel of the fourth generation .
You also saw you who extract ethanol from the gray was a finished experiment .
We have more than the second generation and third generation that will be surround-coow-coow-value coal value , as well as a beautiful cutanol .
But the only way that biology can have a great impact with without increase without increase more than the food and limitate the display of food and limitate the CO2 in matter , which we 're working for design cells that can reach this discovery , and we think of the first one that they can be able to make the first coal of the world . And we think of the first generation in the middle of the generation in about 18 months .
The light sunlight sought with CO2 is a metodow -- but in our discoveries all over the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we described in 1996 .
It 's in the ocean deeply deeply about 2500 feet of ebollition of the water .
They reat the CO2 using hydrogen molecular energy as well .
We 're trying to understand if we can indow the CO2 , which can be easily transported , that can be transported in your coal , to drive that CO2 in carburating , to drive this process .
So , we think we might think we be able to increase what we might be able to increase what is life is the Nooobic . We have the goal of remarkable to reach the whole industry of rempizing the interer-oil intereras .
Exactly . If you don 't do that from TED , where can you ?
It would be a main the bottom of energy .
And also , we 're working for using the same methods to create vaccines .
You 've seen this year with the influence , we 're always back of a year and with a dollar , when it 's a dollar , and it 's a dollar in the right .
I think that that you can change building combinable in a lot of a lot of inable in ancient .
So , this is how the future could start to look at change , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating the evolution with batterns , and you end up the eucariote .
We 're so much as the best people .
Our purpose is to be able to live enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
It 's so much about all I 'm going to show you , the most rapidly possible , some fundamental work , of the new technology that we 've taken to the Microsoft in a year ago exactly . This is Seadragon .
It 's a lot of a environment that you can interact is the local level that remote with a huge amount of data .
So here we 're seeing a very digital gabyte of digital photos and continue , for a quick woooothers , disponing the images of how we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big is the amount of information that we see , how great these are the data or pictures or the images of data or data .
Most of the digital photographs , but this is a scanning scanning from the Biiiblioteck of Congress , and requends in the leg of 300 megapixel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that 's limits prestations of a system like this is the number of player on your screen in the moment . It 's also a very flexxible architecture .
This is a book , I 'm a book , example of data not images .
This is the Dickens of Dickens . Every colonna represents a capitable .
And to show you that it 's about the text and not images , we can do something like this , to make a real thing of this is a real real representation of the text , not a picture of the text , not a picture of the text , not a picture of the text , not a picture of the way to show you that it 's a real picture of the text , and we can do something like this , to be a real thing of the kind of the rest , and we can 't do something like this .
It could be a little artificial way to read a book to read a book .
It doesn 't have to be .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the Wardian .
Every image of the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of the version of a revision or a quotidian , which is for nature , which is a molteplice .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Wear .
We created a higher advertising , higher than that you use a higher -- much more than that you use in a normal publicity -- and we 've been insered to you of the content .
If you want to see the characterists of this craft , you can see here .
Or other models , or even specific specific , or even specific specific .
And this really demonstrates of these ideas to eliminate the limitations of space on the screen .
We hope that means that that that means to put the pop-up and other docheries , not should be necessary .
And of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this won 't want to lose time , if we don 't want to say that we have to be able to give it in this camp .
These are all the streets in the USA suear picture of NASA geospatial image of NASA .
So now we 're going to go to something else .
This is now actually by the Web ; you can go to the web ; you can see it .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research computing in Noah Snavort , student of the University of Washington , with the aid of Steve Steve Steve Szeliskelisi . It 's a Szeliskeliss . " It 's a . " It 's optim .
And it 's from the Web , gested by Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of patterns , where we can go from a image to the other and have this kind of experience and have this kind of experience to the multiple resolution .
But the space space space of the pictures here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization computers have recorded these images together , so that they running up to places , and these things are all the near to the U.K. Montagne Roctops -- all the way you see the elements of the Rocococcurred -- and they 're taking . So , what the things are all college . And these things are all college . And these things are all the space of space .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space space .
I want to go directly at one of the original data of Noahhysis -- and this prototype of Photosymptotype of Photosynth , that we 've done for the first time the scorce scores -- to show you what 's the technology is really clear . And it 's not necessarily evident . And it 's not necessarily reverse to the environments that we 've got in the website .
We had to worry about the laws and on the laws and saying .
This is a rebuild the Notre rebuild the Let 's pictures of Notre Dame . Baast digitar . Baast digitar , and you get images of the maglight-up , other of the field of the maglight-up representing .
So , they 're all picked from Flickr and they 're all college to the space space space space space space .
And it 's possible to navigate this way simple .
You know , I 'd never thought about the end of the way to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying this kind of accounters here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of phone of phone : those of the phone of the phones in the professional SLR , a number significant significant , machine , a lot of meant , muts together in this environment .
And if I can , I 'm going to try to look for those strange .
And it 's a lot of it block , etc .
And somewhere here 's a series of photographs -- here .
This is a poster of Notre Dame recorded correctly .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do with social environment . This is now taking data from the entire memory -- from the intermemory of visual visual -- and college to everybody those data together .
All those pictures become , more than the som of the som of the som of the parts .
You have a model of the land that emerge of the land that emerge .
Think about this as a wind-like work of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grows as complexity as people who are using it , and the ancient that people use it to increase with the use .
And their photos are insered by other people .
If someone is the idea of meet to meet all these saying saying the name , my photo of Notre chaximage of Notre Dame improvisely to all those data of those data , and I can use how to emmerged in that space , using photos in that meet , using the photography of everybody else , and have a cross-mobile photographers .
And , of course , a consequence of all this is virtual model of all interesting elaborated in the land , collecting -- collecting you would have no aircraft pictures and satellitaries , but from the college of all the time .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software there to us to do is that that you can do is that in the next few years , in the next few years , all the photographs , all the photographs in the world will be together ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is basically discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the basis in the content of the images .
And what it 's really interesting if you think about the crazy of the security of the seats of the images of these images .
As when you do a research of images on the web , and the text of the web page and the text of the web page of the picture .
Now , what happens if you 're college to all your picture ?
So , the amount of interconnection and the amount of interconnection and the amount of remember that it 's really huge . It 's a classic classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pilefters when you travels and one of the research of the research is the power of living in the antistage , between who have the antistage in the wind , between who 's the wind , the touch in the wind , the touch of the plants .
And I think that scians Jaguar travel even the Via Lattea , or that the Milthea , or who mites in Himalayas , the good people who are going to be able to meaning the major of Dharm , to remember the important room , to remember the important thing that the central anthropology , and that the idea that the world we live in the world , but it 's just a model of fact ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stroyed , or mal generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
All we all do . We all procrease .
We 're subjects of the beginning of the beginning .
We have to deal with the inesorability of death , so it doesn 't surprising and it 's not going to be surprising and ballit --
We all have a art .
What color is the particular of the song , the rate of the song of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they are the " " " the Borneo , or the following Vooodoo , or the Haiti , or the werriers of the Kaisut in Kenya settettriers , or a wander in the Kenya , or a cameras .
He was my journey of trip in the desert of a month ago , or a hand-a-values in the Everest , the deeper of the world .
All of these populations are teaching there are other ways of existing people who are thinking about , other ways of model in the world .
And , if you reflect a second , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
Insize with , the world 's measure-cultures of the world creating a spiritual life that we fly the planet and it 's important for the planet , and it 's important for the planet as the planet as the ragela .
And you can think of this cultural ragela cultural ethnosfied , and you can call the the total ethnosmom , inspiration , ideas , inspiration , ideas , inspiration , inspiration , inspiration ,
The etnosfic is the patrimony of humanity .
It 's the symbl of what we are and what we can be in the kind of inquisitive .
And because the biosphere was free consumed as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as well .
No biological , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species has been or the orlo of the extinction , because it 's false , or the most apockical hypothesis -- in the most optimistic diversity -- and you don 't even even even closer to the world 's more optimistic -- that 's the most optimistic of the diversity .
The indes of all that is , of course , the language of the language .
When you 're born there were 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just by a vocabulary , or a series of rules .
A language is the human sprazy .
It 's the midddle of which the animal of every culture is reaching the material world .
Every language of the mind is a forest , a thought , a thought , a spiritual ecosystem of the system .
And of those 6,000 languages , while we sat in Monterey , at least half is not more suddenly surred in the ears of children .
They don 't come to children , the kids , which means that it means , unless than not cambs , which are already dead .
What is there more sad than the sad than being fly from the silence , the last site , the last language of the language , not have to be able to transmitting the children ?
This horring was the state of someone in the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks are motor and bring with the team of the last syllabs of a ancient language .
And I know somebody who are going to say , " Is it better ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we 're talking about all the same language ? " Well , we talk to all yoruorbit . It 's going to be a snake .
So let 's talk kogs .
You 'll cover a tract of what you want to say , not to talk about language .
I 'd like to do a journey through the journey --
a little journey in the etnosfied to give you a assage of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of existing existing , " I mean , " I mean , very different ways of existing .
We take for example , this is a Barasana , Amazony , Amazony sector , the ancial popular wave from the latte of the latte of the latte of the swales of the swalloon .
It 's a popular popular that it 's not able to distinguish the blue because the blue is identified in the forest time of the forest , which depends the popular popular .
They have a strange language and a mathematrimonial , " " " " " " " " Do " " you have to you a different language .
And all of this radical past , yet the past , yet the particularity is that in these families that are talking about six or seven language seven language of mathematrimselves , nobody 's basically a language .
They 're limited to listening and then start to talk about .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waorani Waorani Ecuador the Waorani popular , a popular popular popular that has had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionaries have tented a common a commodities .
They did the top of the photographs that were were in pose that they were friending , forest that this population population , forest that this population population was never seen anything about bi-dimensional bi-dimensional photographed .
They 've been running the photographs , they turned out of a shape or a figure out of the diavel , and they kill the five missionaries with the suncle .
But the Waorani doesn 't just kill the straniors .
They kill between them .
The 54 percent of the mortality was caused by their same .
We 're risales at eight generations and we found two cases of morte , and when we 've been sitting to know , they have a lot of them who was invecky that he died , and then they killed it , and then they killed it with it .
The clacers were able to recognize the animal urina animal and recognize the species .
In the first ' 80s , I was assigned a very interesting tremely when my Harvard , I asked to go to Harvard to Haiti in the society of the secret of Duvalier 's the Tonton Macoutes , and impossessing me to do the fast of Duvalier , and impossessing me of the speed of the speed of the speed of the speed of the speed of the speed of the speed of the speed of the fast of the speed of the speed of the speed of the fast of the seeding of
So , to give a sense of miracological sense , I should have to understand the Vodoun culture that Voodoor is not magnery .
It 's pretty much than a complex vision measure of the world .
So , very interesting .
If I ask you to say , the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Budaism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has not feed religious . And instead of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts .
What makes the voodoor is the intense is the intense of life and dead .
So , you 're going to get the spirits .
The spirits can be invested by Great the Great the rate of the dance of the dance and replace to the soul of the vive vive vive the willing to be the way to be the cool .
So , that 's voodooists , you know , " I 'm going to talk about God .
We say , we say in the temple and divention the temple and God . "
And from the moment that you 're going to be , you know , you know that you 're driving you , as you can do the walking ?
So you 're going to these incredible events : follow voodoor in the state of trance that touch that touch a rather strongest demonstration of the power when it 's cataled in a state of the power when it 's cataled in a state of the body when it 's cataled in a state of the body in the way .
And I was the popular with the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary are the Kogi Kogi 's Kogi , in Santa Marta , in Colombia sector .
It 's scendenends of civilization that once they live on the planure of Colombia in the wind of the conquirt , the popular wers on the willing to the willing maining on the maining piece of the planets .
In a macy continent of blood , this popular , this popular has never been conquirt by spages .
And so , in fact , they are government from a clery , but their formation is very extraordinary .
The young people are taking away from the families to three or four years , and they live secreated in a world made of good cheered in the world 's made of the glacier for the ice of the ice of the ice for the ice of the ice for 18 years .
Two draw , nine years of proposed to reduce the nine months of gestation that spent in the user of the Great Mther .
So , so , so that time , they come up to the values of their society , values that they predicts their predict and just their predict to the cost , and just to say the equilibriefly .
At termines of this incredible beginning , they 're improvisually taken out and for the first time in 18 years , they see a alba . And in that accounters of the first cutterm , when the sun , the values of the beautiful values , everything that they have learned in the beautiful thing is conferred to the fer . The predict does a furch ago , it 's a step . The predict does a step is , and he says ,
" I 'm going to pright ? I said .
It 's stupend . Now it 's to you protect it . "
It 's called brothers and they say that we are , fratels , we 're the colputs of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the ingene populations and the environment , we think of the Rololden , which is a story of the self-self-self-wilditive , which is a razy concept in his simplicity or magic , and we say that these populations are closer to the Earth .
The Indigenes are not not exciting or or unhappy .
There 's no space for these things in the palures of the Aststststatives in the gelids of the Tibet , but thank you at the time and rites , they created a mistic of the Earth 's Earth 's not on the concept of being known , but on a byle , the concept that the Earth can live in the consciousness of human connected .
What does it mean ?
It 's like a guy of the Ande who grows up that the mountain that the mountain is a spirit of Apu that 's going to be a human destiny , and it will have a very different human report and it 's going to be a very different , and it 's going to be a very different way , and it 's going to be a mountain of Montana , and it 's going to be a sheat .
which is the hour of a spirit or a mineral wall , or a mineral wall is .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the methaphor that defines the individual world .
I grew up in the forests of the Columbia Britannica credating that the forests services that the forest walking .
And what he made me a human being in the world 's human being Kwakiutl that believe that the forest forests are the Hukukuk and the stored of the paradied of the paradied and the stories that live in the world , explaining that they live in the world , explaining the world 's the beginning .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some their discoveries of their sensitive discoveries . We take this plants .
I 've been taken to this picture in the northerwise Amazony .
Mayahuasks about the ayahuasks , the most powerful sustainant sustainant repertoilet 's look at the sciamanic repertoial repertoilet .
What makes the plasy of the ayahuashuasks is not the potential to the sustainant , but his elaboration . It 's composed to two elements .
It 's a landlady , this lexial leaving a series of it , harming and harmful , slightly hologens , read probably hologens .
I take the only plant is the plant is the piece of the patterns that alters a little consciousness , but it 's mixed with the leaves of the cause of the coffee , and it 's got to redis .
This plant is sad powerful powerful , very similar to the serotonin the smoththoxyltrypamines , methoxypamines .
If you 'll ever see the Yanomami , you 'll see the nass that they make a different set of species , anched methoxyltrysis , and it 's a lot of it .
I 'll be in that police on the nass is a little bit like to be spared by a fire saying pink of the deal with purchase purching . [ Rate ] [ Risn 't believe a storsion of reality . It 's not creates the dissolution .
I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wake the man was psychephic , with his discovery of fungi in Mexico .
I 'm not going to be able to classify these triplots like slamine , because if you 're not going to tell you you you you can 't tell any of being killed . [ Risn 't really hort ] [ Risn 't be horally orders because they are money from a concerned , because they are money from a monoamineered , and it 's a monoamineerly .
It 's possible to be absumerely , if you 're just saying with other summmer such that money the MAO .
Now , it 's the beautiful : the beautiful : the beautiful sliana are injumped in this liana of the MAO , the same kind of the sads . The question is , the sads of the sads , like these popular popular , like these popular popular , but that if you combine two death , but that if you combine it 's fight , they 're not , but that if you combine a danger of the parts ?
We use the great eusted of the proof of and error , which can revehicle .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " The plants talk about us . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , the Cofan , which has 17 variety of ayahuasks , and that our eyes were nectely in the same species .
If we ask them as a little bit of their tasonomy , they will tell us , " I thought of plants , I didn 't know all ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night of lun lands and each other , and each other , and each other .
With this is not a Harvard to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting to contact the stami .
Now , [ [ applauses ] the problem is that even the people who have heart populations are ingenes , but somehow reduced you to the margins of the story of the story of our real world , and it 's beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it 's not going to remember or its innovations , but rather like the world , we 're stopped and we have a bad , and we have been used or accepted , and we have a vast destruction of the world 's biological destruction of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All cultures through the secles have been involved in a dance for new chance of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux didn 't stop being Sioux when they put from the areas and fly as the American American people have been stopped by the horse and calculations .
It 's not the change or technology that mines the integrity of the ethnosat . It 's the power .
The flight fly of the domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you 'll find that these are not cultures that these are cultures in the world .
They 're creatures and dynamics spint from the existence of identify forces that will be beyond their ability of adaptation .
I 'm like that you treat the patria of the patria of the patria of the patria of the patria of the patria of the patria of the patria of the patria of the patria of the ption of the patria of the ption of the patria of the patria of the patria of the patria of the patria of the disbottom-scening in the pats of the pats of the patria .
a popular popular , in the Sarawak , in the Sarawak , a popular who lived free in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to the service , and now reduced to the service of the rive revenue of the river referred of the light-up and the MCinese Merar Cinese , where you can see the Meriererar Merererererar Cinese , where the horest Merian Cinese swalasian Asian ,
and you get the standing standing to the wood of the forest .
Or , in the case of the Yanomami , are diseases that are the disease of the discovered of the gold .
If we were on the Tibet , we 're on the Tibet , where I 'm doing many research of political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physical extinction of a popular , is condanncide , but the etnocide , the destruction of lifetime , not just condition , it 's not just condition , but it 's not just condition , because it does part of the development of the development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet of the Tibet until you 're not part of the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in China Wocld West Tibet South South South South , and just came to Lhasa , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what is behind is that we feel about .
6,000 monuments sacres reduced in polyiellow sorts .
1.2 million people killed from military military during the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical at Panchen Lama .
The thing that means that it was killed to the Chinese dly ,
I 'm going to Sua Santity in Santity during the diasptaking the popular popular in Nepal .
And his mother was impressed and his collit was to be .
It was brought of nascost in the age of two years nascondensed under his gonna because it wouldn 't have lived to live without him .
And the sister , which has been put in reached by reducation .
A day , he walked up a day , a day , and I was a Mao and , for this transgression , was moved to the force of seven years .
The Tibet can be insopportable , but it spirit , it 's reinside the popular is from the popular population .
At the end , all you reduce it to a choice .
We want to live in the world world 's world 's monooy or we want to get the policy world 's world 's policy ?
The great anthropology Margaret Mead , before he said that his greatest fear was that , in our way to love this vision of the world , we 're going to see the whole gamma of human imagination of human imagination , we 're going to a limitated by a sonce of thinking , but one day us from a sondon 't just sonmenting us from a sonmenting , because there there was a sonmenting of the world , we 're going to be able to be .
And it 's umillion equires that our species is there for 60,000 years .
The Neolitical volution , who gives us the agriculture , which has made us to sat the cult of the seed cult of the chler 's sitting the cler 's property of the cler , creating the gerarchy of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industrialized is 300 years .
That 's a while , it doesn 't suggests that we have the answers that we should have all the challenges that we should get to the millenny to come .
When these mirist of cultures of the world is asked what to say is being human , answer to 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all risky the possibility of being what we are : a consciously conscious , which has to make all the people who are driving the gardas can trade . And there are great moments of optimism .
I 've been taken this picture on the northern of the hya , when I went to cut up with the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , and he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The government is not always gentile with the Inuit , and the 1950s to stick our premise , we have rink them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refected to go .
The family , for his life , I 'm going to his lifted up to all the arms , and all his reacks .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn 't teach the cold ,
The bad slextes in origin were made of fish flight in the skin skin .
The grandfather than this man , he didn 't intimise from the articy or the libraries .
It 's gaulated , and it 's calculated the skin skin skin in skin in skin and defected in the hand . When I did the hand , the works of the blooks at .
He 's spred on the door of this college of this college , and when I was solido , he kill a dog .
He washed the dog and created a bridaughter , with the cash , has created a slitt , and it 's sleep , and it 's disappeared on the block , collide in the remains .
We want to talk about cavarsely with anything ? [ Risy ] And this , in different ways , [ Applauses is the symbl of the popular popular popular popular populations of the world .
In the 1999 , the government canader 's Enuit , the total control of the total area of the larger of California and the Texas a together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's a Independent territory . They Controlly all the minerary resources .
One splends of the example of how a nation-state can recognize with his popular popular .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious at least who of us was in these remote zone of us was in these remote zone of the planet , remote that they don 't remote .
For somebody is home .
They represent sections of human imagination that treatment are days . And for us all , the dreams of these children , like dreams of our children , become part of our children , become part of the swisdom of hope .
For finishing , we have National Geographic , we are convince that political argument will never be anything .
We believe that polemiics --
[ Applauses ] there are not persuasive , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Ogammese is 35 million lived .
156 countries transmitted our television canal canal canal .
Our revided by millions of people .
Our work is travel in the ethnosfifer to bring our audience in the beautiful place of cultural anthropology , they 'll go wrong with , and hopefully , they 'll be able to be reveiling for the central anthropology : the world 's world 's existing . And we have to find a lifetime of life in a world . And we have to find a lifetime .
where the wisdom of all the populations can contribution to our well-being collective .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I 'm going to be about more than you 've heard and I 'm going to evidence some college college , in case not them .
I 'd like to start with what I call " the dogen dogma . "
The dogma is official of what ?
The official dogen of all the industrial society West Is dogma dogen official : " If we want to massive the well-being of our citizens . "
The reason is , from a side , in fact that the freedom is in the same value , it 's precious , it 's precious , essential for humans .
In the other is in the fact that if we are free , each of us can act for all that massive to do everything that massive our well-being , without any that decided in our well-being , nobody that decided in our name .
The way to massive freedom is the freedom is choice .
The choices people have , more liberty , and more is their liberty , it 's their well-being .
This , I think , it 's so very radical in the society that nobody would be such to put it in doubt .
And it 's also deeply radiced in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some of what progress has ress possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly great .
I 'm going to be a simple nice nice for injumped .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without content 10 variety of the extract 10 variety of olive , and 12 acetes that you can buy for you to get a huge number of condition in the circumstance that nobody of the 175 of them is ready to your degreat-degreat-a-foots .
That 's what 's the supermarket .
And then you go to the electronic negotie to buy a stereo , lead , leaving the CD , radio , radio , leaver the left , lead , leaver .
And in this single negoties in this negoties , there 's a great number of components .
We can make six million and a half of different combinations using the components that there are just a negoties in a negoties in .
You have to love that there is a very choice .
Altrications : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the desires of the phone phone , and that they were forned by momen , and that they were forned by momly Bell .
It was for it . It was not to buy it .
And a consequence of that , between the other , was that the phone was never romped .
These days are gone .
Now , we have a variety of the phones , especially between phones .
So here 's the phones of the future .
My favorite is the middle , the MP3 , tut of the naso , and foreign in the lin the short , and foreigny to the neighborn .
If you don 't have seen it in the negotie under home , you 're burn certain that will be able to be .
And what happens is that people are in the negoties in the negoties and does this question . And you know , what is the answer is ? The answer ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the budly aquists , you true the same exhibition of choice .
Assistence health , it doesn 't happen in the United States that you would go from doctor and the doctor and doctor , and the doctor , what you have to do .
Instead , you won the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we can do A , or B , " Hoy , " Hoy , " Hoh , " By , " Hig 's the benefits . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Dottore , what I should do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits , and these risks , and these benefits . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebad , " Doctore if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor , " But I 'm not her . "
The result of the result of the maled , " expression that it seemed it to make it a beautiful thing .
But it 's actually not that a posting , and the responsibility to take decisions from someone who knows something , which is the doctor , to somebody else else , and so it 's not in the ideal condition to take the decisions of the patient decisions to take the patient decisions of the patient .
There 's a huge marketing products , direct people like me and you , who if you think there 's no sense , because you think that if you think it doesn 't understand them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do it , because they 're public ?
The answer is that they want to doctor , we call the doctor for the recipe to change the recipe .
Something is like that is our hort , is our hort is a question of choice , as you see in this vision , " We don 't want to force children . They 're going to be a moment of the right now . " We don 't want to reach .
And we can reinventing how many times us .
The that means that every morning , at the time , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
I 'm going to the family and matrimony , a time time , and then it was common , almost for anyone , was that it was that you could be the most possible possible , and he was started to get kids .
The only real choice was with who , and not when , and not even what to do after .
Over day , all of it 's really to play .
I teach very smart students , and I 'm 20 percent work than about a time .
And it 's not because they 're not unless diligent .
but because I 'm such a such , I 'm going to ask , " I should wish or not ? I should I do that now ? I 'm going to do that now ? "
" I should be later ? I have to think before , or the further ? "
They 're interrogatives .
And they 're trying to answer to these questions , even if this implished not completely to the compassion that I 'm asseeding a vote to my exame .
And they have to be really important . They are questions .
Now , the work : We 're lucky , like Carl I was , because technology allows us to work every minute , every day , every day , every every day , from every single angle of the planet , transphered by the Hotel Randoly .
And I 'm talking about it , there 's a corner , and I 'll not tell you what , where the WiFi works .
I don 't say , because I want to use it .
What means , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work ? It 's that we have to keep , all the time , if we have to work or no .
We can go to see our son son , and the phone , with the phone , the Blackberry , the Blackberry in the other , and the ntice , and the nake , the ginoccurred .
And even if they are all spent , every minute that we see our son , we 're also asking the party , we 're also asking , " I have to answer to this called ? "
" I had to answer this email ? I had to hold this letter ? "
And even when the answer is no , that 's not , that makes the experience of your son 's very different from what it would be in other conditions .
So , from whatever we look at , little bit of things , and the things of life , the lifetime , life is a question of choice .
Once the world was this : Ovute , there were some possibility , but not all of choice .
The world today is it looks like this : The dilemma is , " It 's a slide thing , or negative ? "
The answer is , the answer is .
The positive we all know , we all know , so I 'm going to talk about the negative ones .
All this choice : All of two negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxially , is that produces instead of paralysis that fliberation .
With options of the options of the options that choose , it becomes very hard to do .
I 'm going to give you a significant example : a further of volunteer purs .
A colleaged to the data of the Vanlook at the data of the Vanlook at the data of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the bottom of the further companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adion the great-adion , percentage of two percent .
With 50 source of offered , there 's 10 percent adesions than adesions when they are disponable . Why ?
Because with 50 funding on 50 bottom of the floor , is hard to decide , and choice is to go to the inquestions .
And at questions , and again , questions , questions , questions , and questions never arrive .
You know that it doesn 't just mean that these workers are going to eat food for cans because they don 't have enough money , they will happen , because they don 't want to say that the decision is that they lose the funding the funding of complementary .
It 's not to talk about it , they 're losing to five dollars for a year from the dator of work , which would be disposed to real .
So the paralysis , the consequence of the trovers of the trovers .
And I think that makes the world .
" And finishing , for the eternity : ketchup , feeling or maionese ? "
You know , you know , it 's the right decision , if it 's the ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the bottom , and even the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can have to avoid the paralysis , and we 're not unless undreams from the result of how we would be not as a remarkable scale .
And that 's for fun reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of the conditions that you would choose , if you buy a lot of it 's not perfect , it 's easy , it 's easy , it 's easy that it would be better . And what 's what 's going on is that the alternative to imagine , there is a lot of choice , and the remember the decision ,
And even when it was a decision .
And it 's choices , it 's easier is easy to be dispilexed than whatever detailable of the choice .
And it 's also , there 's what economists are called the opportunity .
Dan Gilbert asked very well as a lot of things like the value we 're value to things about what we 're in the way that the confront of what we are in the way .
In the rest , when there are many options of the options , it 's easy to represent the treatment carattern of the alternative option that is choice .
So , here 's a example . I was all the New York .
But it 's what you probably think about .
There 's this copy to the Hamptons .
A place of the luser .
It 's going to spend . Ottim . It 's day . It 's all for them .
Not nothing . But what he think is , " Well , the built , it 's Agogoal . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan is . "
" I could talk about front of the house in front of home . "
And I 'm going to pass two weeks , the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the chance of parking where it wants .
The opportunity is decrease for what we have , even when we choose the thing is , even when the choice was old .
And more are the options that we have to look at , more the characteristic characteristic characteristic .
So here 's another example .
This vision says a lot of things .
It 's us to live the moment , and maybe the living living living slowly .
But the most important point is that whatever you choose , you know , you know , you know , you know , you don 't do the other .
The things that we don 't choose to be active active than they can make less attractive things that we do .
Third point : it 's growing growth of expectations .
I tried to my skin beating a new couple of jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were just just like , they buy them and vestivestivestia , were just dissimulation , just after you 've been brought to a lot of times , and they were going to go well .
So , I went to buy a new new when the old ones were gone , and I said , " I 'm going to be a couple of jeans , this is my wrong . "
The fit said , " Li wants to slim , easy , relaxy ? "
He wants to the wind , and the bottons ? " Stonewashed or " ? "
" Do you want to strapped ? "
" You know , you want to the gets , and it 's a ble , " Continuated it .
I was sitting , and after a little bit , and after a little bit of , " I want to say , " I want the only kind of the only kind of thing that was , so I tried to all the maledes of jeans , then used out of jeans , and then with the best couple of jeans that I 've ever had .
It was the massive . I was all that choice . I was going to get the better .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that I was the worst of the weless of the wait was very high , jeans should be perfect .
And I was the minime , I was wait . I didn 't expect anything excited when there was just a kind of 100 different kind , but when I saw up , at least a kind of a kind of had to be perfect .
What I was buy , but it wasn 't perfect .
And after I was talking about that choiced with what I was trying to be in the expectations .
The addition of the options in life of people don 't make the expectations that these have respond to the options that these options have respond to the options of the options of options in the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the options of the
And this will produce less undreams , even when the results are good .
None in the world of marketing in the world of marketing .
Because if you know , you don 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth more like this .
" It was better when he was worse , " The reason that he was better when he was better when he was worse , he was that when he was worse , it was even possible to meet the surprised .
Over the world , in the world we live in -- opulent , industrialized citizens of the perfeeling -- the perfeeling that we can hope is that things are at the altitude of the expectations .
You don 't have surprised because your expectations , my expectations , measurements are ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse wait , " Yes , you want to . "
I mean -- little self-moment moment -- that I 'm really sitting and my wife is really study .
I won 't have to do better , I 'm not accounted .
But that 's not always to be a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of the jeans in the jeans of the jeans is that when you 're just the kind of jeans is that when you 're not to be saying , and you know , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " " " The answer is .
The world is the responsible . What could I do you do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a soul , and you ask you who is responsible , and you ask you who is responsible , it 's the responsible , it 's altreat responsible .
You might have been doing better .
With hundreds of variety dispon-hundreds of the insuccessful .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is , you know , they feel the result is , and they hold the colcolate to them .
In the last years , the last years , the depression is expression in the industrialized world .
I think a factor , I think a factor , but important -- I don 't want to the only thing that the depression of the depression of the depression of the people because the standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the color is their color .
So the end end end of the final result is that we 're better better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogen , what we all take for good and it 's completely false . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is that it doesn 't have to have a lot of choice is not to sell , but that 's not going to sell .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure that we 've been supered by a piece of the level where the best choices are the best choices of our life .
Now , from politician of view -- I 'm politician -- I 'm political point of view , the nocity is the following .
What allows that all this is the material in industrial society is the material to be .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , the problem is not that they have too choice .
The problem is that they have too little bit too .
So the easy of which I 'm talking about is a disease of modern modern modern , remember West .
And what it does to be like , and arrand it 's this : Steve Levitt talked about yesterday , and discovers of seats are inuseful . It 's a sphere of money .
I mean , that 's complicated and dispenvironment , it 's not that they are useful .
They 're adapticy .
They do us worst .
If a little bit of what in our society allows that was reversed in those people who are too few people too few possibility , it wouldn 't just be their lives , but our own life .
This is what economists call a pareting paretian .
A refined refined , it 's good at all -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice in excess that we go back .
For to conclude , you can , you can be all of what you want , "
You know , people of culture , you think , what does that fishing ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get anything in a glass . "
" A castrated imagination , a limited of the world -- "
and I 'm going to be like this , at the beginning .
But then , think about it , instead , instead , I realized that that fish the long .
Because the reality of fact is that if you eat , you 're eating the bock , so that , " all you can 't get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you 're going to row the bocks in the way that everything possible possible dealufaction .
You get the paralysis , and you 'll reduce the well-being .
All they need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too much , maybe even for the fish , and it 's not about us .
But the asn 't some symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic sympolic sympolic sympolic .
Thank you .
