The year I showed these diasions to show that the calculate glacial artics , which for almost three million years of years of years of years of years of the 48 States , it 's reduced 40 percent .
And that 's this sound , the gravity of the problem because I don 't show the ice of the ice of the ice .
The glasial artics is , in a certain way , the heart of global climate system .
You can swait and you can get up .
The next next to be a rapiece is a free of the last 25 years .
The gets ales have been drived in red red .
As you see , you see it 's until the blue .
That 's the ice ice ice in the ice , which you can get extt .
You can see that the cosidgn told , five years or five years or more , is like the sangue , which is like the sangue , which here is like the body .
In 25 years , it 's been so ,
This is a problem because the run is the whole term gap around the ocean , where there are huge where there are huge to the ocean , and they 're huge , and they 're going to be able to put it in meters .
I spect to toxity of the atmosquarter by global warming , that quantity could be , squantity , that squantity could be around .
In some laghi , you can profound in Alaska meter 's already bolling .
The professorespese Katey Walter of the University of Alaska team , I remember a laby .
Video : Wow , Gore : You 're good . The question is if we 're going to be .
A reason is that this screen to the Groenland from the northern Groenland from the northern .
This is a remind .
The brought it had never reached them .
This is the Kangerlussud-south , in the south of Groenland .
If you want to know how the lest level of the ice of the ice of the ice of ice ice ice , here is where we get the mate .
These corrents are ring .
Another part of the planet : Antartttartttartttice of the planet .
The month , the scientists have dikilows that the blood of the ice is in negative , and the Antartarttttarttttarttttartttes , it 's particularly .
Every six meters of the level of the level , like in Groenland .
On Himalaya , the most biggest later , you see new ice , they 're going to see new laghi , which , who were gone , who were gone .
The world 's worlddress was going to the water of water .
Sulle Angone : this ice is the source of water .
The brought it is car .
But when they dimine , the same access water .
In California , the neve on the Nevada is diminutes of 40 percent .
The gets inges are in the crisis .
The predictions , like you have a graves .
The growth of the world 's world 's taken a night .
The environmental environmental reaching a normal , and without precedented .
Four times more number of the last 30 years , I 've been precedented 75 .
This is a further of all insustainable .
And if you look at the context if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we add 70 million tons of CO2 24 hours , 24 hours of the ocean every day .
Look at the Pacific area , the American , the American , the American parts , and the bottom of the subcontinent , where there 's a radical impoverty , where there 's a radical impoverty .
Most of global warming , together , together , and it 's the deforest , which is the 20 percent , it 's the usually , they 're not .
The oil is a problem , and the coal problem is even worst .
The United States are one of two countries with the most emissions , together at China .
And it 's proposed to build a coal .
But we 're going to a change of direction .
These are the projects , the last years , and some propose of the last years , and some of the alternative versus .
And every way , there is a lot of politics in our country .
The cocooes of the oil of oil , they spend 250 million dollars in the last year to promotion , which is a coal , which is a slit , which is a simate .
And this picture I remember something --
I see Natale , in the Tennessex , where I live , there was a losed of 3.8 billion sons of gathered oxion .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the largest flow of choices in America .
It happened around Natale .
The advertiity of one of the industry of the coal of coal industry .
Video : I 'm going to be the coooooooooooxide and happy .
It 's a floor here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
Frosty the carbon is more .
It 's a good good price , adorable and the worlers , they 're going to keep it .
Al Gore : Da is free part of the West Virginia .
The largest society is Massey , is Massey Coal . This is her love .
Video : Don Blankenship : Sarchiark -- Al Gore , Nancy Peloday , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So Alleance for the Clie for the Clim has two campaise .
This is a lot of it , one part .
Video : ALergy : ALergy see the climate change like a sery .
For this is to be able to be a great amount of money in a great site of a spot of a public squity and conflicity .
In fact , the coal is not spores .
We think it 's also , it 's also a good good good .
So , it doesn 't preocupatees .
Let me do us .
Video : Acore : Carbone , you 've heard .
So , I do you get a game in a street of the way , as it 's about how to be as the coal .
Straordinary ! The machine is a little bit rump , but this is the suggest of the coal technology .
The consumption is between the main global remain global warming , but the night of the global coal , but the night that you see it all .
You see a lot of this is the odiern technology of the coal .
Al Gore : At the end of the network , the slights , the site of the national cheap and that 's national security .
Video : Comment : The America is in the economy , the economy , the site , the crisis .
The free college that we have to have the dependence , as the cooil , like the coal , like the coal , and oil oil and oil .
Now , I 'll go , there is a new , car solution for use .
Repower , 100 percent of energy , in the midle .
A piano to put the worth work , makes it more sure , and help us more to stop global warming the global global .
Finally , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
Repower . Scool .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Yeah , it 's to America .
One of the most speed of the most faster to the end of the faster 's cooddence that we killed our planet .
It 's the future is here . It 's here . It 's here .
It turns out , " Nuovues for places for places .
Comment : Repower . It 's time . It 's time .
Al Gore : A old , you know , you want to go to say , " If you want to go to the sun .
If you want to go to the back , you go together . "
We need to go to the stage , speed .
Thank you very much .
The year , I 'm going to TED feculation on the LHC .
And I promise to get to beach you to get to the car .
So , so I know what the other time , there were no , the other time , the LHC is is the largest scientific experiment .
His remember is to remember the conditions that they were presents less than a million times of the universe -- until it 's until 600 million times .
All is just environment .
This is the Ginevra .
We 're pictures these mini-Bang Bang Bang Bang 's remember .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLALATLALALARS -- is a free of 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLATLALaw , you can notice the proportions .
The 10 settember year we have accesum the first time .
And this picture was wrong ATLAS .
It 's because of immense it 's going to be festyle in the soulder .
It 's a picture of the first of the first of the first of the LHC , both , both , both of the LHC , and I 'm in the LHC , and spread particles in the LoC , and I spread particles in the Law .
In other words , when we see that the image of the image of the image , we understand that the machine that the machine .
I don 't know if it was going to do more open to do this , when someone went to Google and visual visual the beginning of the beginning was this .
That means that we have a cultural impact .
It was a week later , there was a problem with the machine , you 've got to these fidored field here -- these dored dored .
These challs , they brought when the machine is going to the massive machine .
Now , the technical technicians and say , " It 's not true . They will say , " It 's not true . "
And they can do it because when they 're very cosiddddddddddays .
So , at least 21 degree , at a temperature in the space between the space of the space between the stars , these files can bring that corrent .
In one of the most nothing of the most novehicle magnetes in the LHC , there was a free of fabbrication .
So the free free , and the 13,000 lead , and 13,000 ledouldn 't have a electrical electrical electrical electrical .
This was the result .
Now , this is still more impressive if you think that these magnetnetwork , and that you think these magnetnetwork , and that you have about 30 centimeters .
They 're danneighbored .
We had them to leave them , what we did .
We repristined and it gets .
Now , they 're ring all of them to the ground .
And the end of the end of the LHC will be new integro .
We 're going to get , and we expect us to get the right right , and we 're going to get the right right , and we continue to find what the universe is the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these craft , these craft dibad , these craft and engineering the science and engineering . It 's easy . It 's easy to concerned .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact of the limits , I think it 's the value of things like LHC .
I 'd like to do with the words of a scientist Inglan Inglan , Humphrey Davy , which , you know , in the defesh , his own pubs , his pubs , his publue Faraday , his own own , he said , " Nidience is not a very dangerous thing to the human human remarkable , which is not our human human ideas , and we don 't have to be able to be . "
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to rethink when you , children , the player , play cools .
And you can understand how to realize them and ferring them and moving them and music , learn it , learn it 's really to think and resolve that we solve to record .
The reason is that we understand the foundly connected to the way we understand part of the world around us .
So , by information , by the information of our own own own own own physical , together , with my physical physical , and my collaborator , and my collator , I began to ask me , I began to ask me , " And if we 're a source , " And if we 're a free , I started a little bit of the bottom , I could have a such a little bit of the smom , I could have a physical information with a little bit of the ssis ,
and sists our paciment ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the answer , building the Siften .
In population , a Siftable , a Siften , like a bircocost .
In population , a Siftable , a Siften , like a bircocost .
You can move the hand , can see it with the hand , you can see the movement and a screen and a radio radio .
But it 's basically , they 're objects , like the morning , you can move to .
Siften is the one of a new ecosystem for ecosystem for the digital information .
And as they become more physical , consciouses , the other , and the other , and hand that they become more physical , we can see the physical motion , as we can move , we can exploring new different and different different .
I 'm going to give some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show you about the video : if you inclin a direction , the video raise , and then you go back .
These record are connected to the other other .
And if you 're interested in what 's going to them around .
And if they 're condition , they can get a little bit .
And if they 're condition , they can get a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We 're ressed that one of the interesting of the interaction of the interaction was the power of the data , to the sliquare , " a color , " a color like that if it was a liquest .
In this case , we have three Siften conflict as a seck of verny and I can use it to the color in the cool , where they go .
and I can use them to the color in the central , where you put it .
And if we 're too , we can put a little bit in the place .
There are also beautiful possibility of apprecise , like the math , the math and yes of logical , where people can try and logical things , and you see the fast things , and you see the results of the immediately immediately .
Now , I 'm --
This is a sequence of Fibonacross the equations .
And here we have a player of words that is half between Scarry and Boggle .
Pratically , at every turn a longer literally , in the case of the case , Pratically , in every turn a longer , and while you 're going to be a longer , and as you look at words on the slight-iny .
Then about 30 seconds , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new new site and new possibility to try to try to try to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came to the Media Lab , I did in the Media Lab , I did a video .
They have a very ,
And one of the things of this kind of things is that you don 't have to have to have a lot of education .
And I just say , " What 's the words , " What 's going to do .
Here 's how to do it .
This is our young holding there .
In fact , he wanted to be just to be .
They only have morning , for him .
Now , this is a free of a ton .
We wanted to build one instrument for the language of language , and Lui is Felix .
It can insert new characters in the wind , solve their Siften .
It can insert new characters in the wind , solve their Siften .
So , it 's doing the sole .
Video : The sole is surprisony .
David Merries : Now he took a track in the scene .
Video : The track .
Where is the work ! Yeah !
So , I got the Siften and put up with the character can get the character .
Video : Bau !
-- I inventing the story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It 's a story with final history , and it can decide him as you want to go .
DM : It 's a story with final history , and it can decide him as you want to go .
Video : Video : I 'm going to do .
DM : The last example I 've got time to show you is a cool , I realized , I recently recently , to walk music .
It 's one instrument , I recently , to walk and exept music .
The Siften here , they 're going to suons like base , and the battery .
On one of these four different variations , and you can choose .
You can also be ind to be able to be in a sequence .
And it 's just doing it , just just to do a sugger , " and a sequence . "
These are actually that you can find out of vive , like the reverbs and the films .
The bad to a particular sound and then inclyer , and then including it .
And then there are the general general , as time and fly , which you know , you know ,
We look like it works .
Video : I 'm going to put a base in two Siften , " Siften sequence , " systems , we get up in a series , the extend .
Now , I 'm a line of basically .
Video : Now , I add of the percussions --
Video : And I 'm going to do the fills to the battery , so I can control the effect .
Video : I can speak the intersequence to the interest sequence , and I can go on the other time .
Video : And I 'm going to do the fills to the free filter to give more expression .
Video : I can see the sequence . " I can recombined the squence . "
So I don 't have the first , but I can improvate , but I can improvate , rended to the longest or more cord .
And now , I finally , I can do the intersequence in the right squence . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is built with the model of the mosphere , and more soon as well as well as well as well as well as well as our brain and corbody .
And today , I 've been time to show you one of the results of this lost , and some possibilities that we 're going to bring out from the lab .
The concept that I want to get this new generation of objects to the generation of objects for the digital media , which will bring the digital world that we want to do it .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the now I don 't see it .
I 'm a written .
I 'm going to write book is my profession , of course , this , of course .
It 's also the love and the fascinating my life .
And I don 't expect me that can change .
But , I said , something particular , something particular happened in my life and my own life and my career , which has brought me to remember the interest .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called Manogy , Prega , Prega , " Ame , the different thing , the different books , for some reason , and it 's a great , sensitive , and it 's a great , and the whole whole whole whole whole whole , and the whole whole whole whole whole spot .
And the result is that everywhere , people are going to me as if they were condge as if I were condanned .
David -- I know , I 'm saying .
They go from me now , they 're all worried and say , " I don 't have to do better than do it better ?
I don 't have to keep up to writing all of life without power to create a book that can be able to create a book that can important book ? "
What can important someone ? "
It 's rassumption , you know .
But it could go , part of the most of the more than 20 years ago , when I began to say , when I began to say , I was a saying -- I wanted to be a scritical .
I went to the same reaction of the same reaction .
And people say , " I don 't tel I don 't have to have success ?
I don 't have the huge of the killed you ?
I don 't have to do this for the mestion of life without the liment of life that nothing , and dead on a heart of sometimes , and dead it 's going to the bottom of love . "
So , you know .
The answer -- the answer to all these questions is : " Yes . "
Yes , I 've got the things .
I 've always had been putting .
And I also have a lot of other things that people don 't have to inside .
As the other things , and other things .
But how I was what I thought I was what I thought and I was asked me , and I asked me , and I asked me ,
It 's rational rational ?
It 's logical that anyone to be spent to be spent to be spent to do .
But what 's so particular in the impress creative , and make it nervous to the health of the health of the health , so that other charge they do not do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemist and I don 't remember a sold time in the 40 years of the time that he was asked if they were asked if they were asked to be engineer ?
Do you never -- that blown to John , how ?
Do not that it was so , you know ?
Onestly , the engineers like group as group as a group of the group , driven the reputation of the reputation of being high .
We have a lot of the reputation , and not just writing , and not just written , but creative reputation of all , we have this reputation of being huge .
And I don 't realized that you look at the smot of the magnifiments that creative , just in the 1111111th century , they died them .
And the ones that they 're not suicipating data , they 're not going to be recognize .
Norman Mailer , before , the last , in the last , the last books said , " Ogggggames of the worler of the work of the work of life .
But we don 't bad when we feel because we 've heard these things , we heard these things , we 've been interized and accepted the notion that creativity and the neized that creativity and the soffering , and the end of the art , the end , we 're going to go to the end .
And the question I want to bring all of today is : you are right now , you 're in the idea of this idea ?
And it 's good that -- because I also look at a centimage of a himself , I don 't know that it 's not good for this .
I think it 's odiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodd .
And I think it 's also , and I don 't want to see the next century .
I think it 's better incorate our great minds .
And I 'm sure that , in my case -- it would be very dangerous , it would be able to figure out of the initions , I 'm going to be in my degrees , and you know , I 'm in my career .
And you look at , you look at , I 'm like , I 'm young , I think about 40 years .
I still have about four decadees .
And it 's very likely that any thing I 'm going to be right now , then it 's going to be right on the world as the work that used to do it , and I was going to do it .
I 'm going to ask , because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's likely that my biggest successful is to the mie .
Oh , Gesus , which I think about it .
You know that 's the gence of thinking that 's going to start to the gin the morning of the neighborn and I don 't want to do it .
I would like to keep this work that we 're going to do this work .
So , the question is , how ?
And so I 'm going to me , after many rifessions , that the way to keep to writing is that that it 's to create a psychologic protect , OK ?
I had some way to find a lot of sure that I 'm going to writing , and my natural , and my natural anxion that I 'm going to get them . And as I was trying to get them to look at the time , I was looking at the time , I was looking at the time , and I 'm trying to see other society and see if other society and have a lot of the best things and have to have the best ideas .
And how to help people believe the people creative inerents of the inerents of creativity .
And that research me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
I 'm going to be right in the certain and then back back .
In the ancient Great Rome , and the people don 't seem to create that creativity to creativity , OK ?
It was thought that the creativity was this spirit about the divity , and that they come from a few sister , and they conoscies , for reasons and they conoscies .
The creativity is the spiriters of creativity , the demons of creativity . "
Socrate , wonderful , created to have a demon the sagged that elart from the landscreen .
The Romanaged was the same idea , but they call that species of the body of the body .
The one is great , because the Romanaged , because the Romanaged , they didn 't think a intelligent .
They have to be a genius of the inside of the devine that created had to live in the murs of a study of a study , a little bit like the elfo , and that 's going to be on to the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of that work .
It 's the exighborn -- that 's the distance of what I talked about -- that costruted psychological that you protected to your work .
And all of the way they were so that it was so , right ?
So the artists were protect from certain things , like for example , how to do you , you know , no ?
If your work was exceptional work was not power .
If your work fallives , it wasn 't all the college , right ?
All they know that was your genium to be a incapable .
And so people who are the people , the creativity in Occident ,
Then the Rinascise came and all changed , and it 's going to be the human idea ; we put the human human . And we put the human beings and misters all the of the and mistering and misters without the divinity .
This was the main human rational and people started thinking about the people and the people beginning to think that creativity was completely by ishared .
And I was the first time in the history , you know , it 's going to this or that artist as a piece of genius that one person with a genius that one person with the genius .
And I have to say , I think that was a big herror .
I think it 's going to someone , a simple person to be like a source , the source of the source , the source and the surprising , creationship , creationship , creationship and the source it 's a too big .
It 's like to be asked to someone of ingoes .
You know , it turns out the ego and created all these ingestible inestyable to be on the performance .
And I think it was this pression to the artists in the past of the artists .
And , if this is true , and I think it 's , the question , and now ?
So we can do it different ?
Magary to a more more more than the most ancient of human relationship between human relationship .
Or , it 's not .
Maybe we can 't sell phone of the rational patterns in a talk of 18 minutes .
And there is people , there is people between the public , which would be law , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , they 're going to do their projects .
You know , you don 't know , I 'm going to convinced .
But the question I would like to bring is -- why no ?
Why don 't I think about this way ?
Because it 's more sense of any other thing that ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever .
A process that , as anyone that you ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever do something -- so , all here -- you know , you know , you know , you don 't buy .
And , in fact , you can see it completely paranormal .
I did this incently with the strained extraordinary poetesis , which has been 90 years , but he has been a poetesis , but it was a poetry of the wind Virginy , working on the wind , working on the winside , and I was working on the wind , and I was working on the window .
He said that he said , a fragorous fragorous .
And that was rotoling to her from her from the couple .
It 's heard to come , because he had a tremendous house .
He had a sold thing to be to do that point and it was , and he said , " corring like a math . "
And so he was going to go home and come up to this poetry , and it would not have to do a piece of card and a piece of card and a bad , while the trapprojected , and he was telling the page .
three times I couldn 't be fast enough , so cord and it 's up and recorded and he recorded and it out there and the poetry , and the poetrotols , and it would go through and it . " And he would keep it up to the other poet . " And he said , " I 'm a other poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece of the dimention , there were the moments that the standing of moments that the standing , OK ?
So , he was corring home and he was trying to the home and the poetry was going to the hand , he was a wind , and then he said , and then he said , and then he said , and he said , and then he said , and then the hundred the other hand the wind .
It was the popull the poetry , and the reput in his body and the wind and the turn on on the page .
And in these cases , the poetry is going on on the perfect , but in the last word , the last word at the last word .
So when I think , I 'm going to do -- it 's absolutely use my process to the process of creative creative .
Not all my process -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a music , and my way to work is ; I can see it 's the same orary of the same orary day and I 'm going to go and go and go and go and I 'm going to be .
But I personal , in my head , I have a distrike , I met that , I have a few times .
And I pictures that even have done .
You know , even though the work and ideas were dried to me from a source , I can 't even know , I can 't even know .
And what is this thing ?
And how we can we relationship to it , but , I like we can 't do it , but , rather , it 's going to make it it sans ?
For how I look at the best example , the best example , I have the best example that I have the muister , which I 've interview , which I 've interview for a nal day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life is the incarnation of life is the incarnation of the artist , trying to contemporary , and we 're going to recognize these species of creative inside .
But then I 'm going to go , and a day , and a day as he was driving on a day , he said , " Well , he changed it all for him .
It was going to go and all of a sent , and all of a little framment of melodia , which arrive in his head , and the halls , and the halls , you know , you know , you know , it 's not like the won , and the wasn 't like the won .
It doesn 't have a piece of card , not a math , it doesn 't have a record .
So I began to feel this species of swake , and I 'm going to be able to lose , and I 'm going to sessional sessional sessionate .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of go to the panic , you stop .
It was going to be the whole process and further .
I 'm just going to be the cielum and said , " Scycle , I don 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" To the seems that can write a song now ?
If you really want to be , back in a more opposition when I can take me .
You know , you 're going to important to do anything else today .
I 'll go to disturbing Leonard . "
And his process to change it , he was going to change after this .
Not the work was still like the work was still like .
But the process , and the fish was that I was left when the swaked when the genius , the genius that I was going to be a way that we were going to get back to where they come back to where they come back to where they come back to the back , and I 'm going to be a whole thing that I didn 't have to be a whole thing .
but I won this peculiar , wonderful bizars , a conversation between Tom and this thing strange thing and this thing that I can 't be Tom .
So how I was that story I was going to change a little bit of the way I was working and I was going to save it .
This idea , I 'm going to writing , " Manogy , Prega , Ame , " and the cool of those of the disperation that we 're working on something and we 're working on something and we don 't start thinking that we all begin to think that that it will be a worst , which is going to be a worse , which is going to be written .
Not just bad , just the worst books .
And I started thinking about this project .
But then I remember I remember that I talked about the air and I 've got it .
So I went to my face , I recognize and diressed my hundred of the room .
And I said , " Sents , " Senter , what we know that if this book is not interactly color , you know , not interactly color , no .
Because as I see I 'm going to do all that I have , I don 't have more than this .
So if you want you to give you your part , you , you 're going to do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what I don 't do .
I 'm going to writing the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to do that I was recorded that I was recorded to do my part , " Why -- I finally , OK -- I swait in the deserts of Africa , they were going to the south of the south of the south of the south of the hours that they were going to the hours and the hours .
And they were always magnific , because the balleres were professionists and they were great .
But every long , it 's a lot of , and one of these artists was actually transcendent .
And I know what you know , because I know you 've seen , because I know you 've seen , a lose , a loss .
It was like if the time you stopped , and the ballery , and it wasn 't doing anything about about different .
And the improvement of course not just like a human human human .
But it 's going to the divinity , and under the divinity of the divinity .
And when this is going to the time , you know , people know what it was , they call it col her nothing .
They were the hands and and they begin to slay , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , I know , I 'm going to the hands and , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , I 'm , God , I 'm going to say , " Allah , "
That 's God , you know .
And the nurse note -- when the More More More the Saith of Saian , the south of the Spair , and the sound , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , " Olh , " Olle , " Olle , " Olle , " Olay , " which you can hear in the corride .
In Saian , when a artist did something impossible and magic , " Allah , the word , Spay , Spay , magnic , I was , " I swem , a spot of God .
And it 's great because we need .
But the problem is the problem is the day , for the same , when you see the same , when you see and I see it , and I discovered it , and I won 't go and the screen of God 's not there .
It 's just a mortal mortal with gineye , and maybe it 's going to make it more to be able to clear that alycle .
And maybe nobody will be the name of God still still , and what I still have to do with his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most horders to do a lifestyle ,
But maybe it 's not to be so angotic to be so angoes , if you can 't believe , the most straints of your extraordinary , which is the most extraordinary of your own you .
But you just have to be just that you 're data in the prestable of this squisly , you know , you know , you 're going to go to something that you have to say , you 're going to the other when you 're finished .
And , you know , if we think about this way .
And so I started thinking , and it 's sure , and it 's sure as I thought for different months of the book that I thought , I 'm going to do the book that I 'm going to do , the period , I 'm going to do my great success .
And what I have to keep me when I feel when I feel eltated by this is , not have .
It doesn 't go to . It 's just your work .
It 's going to presented your part of your part , any can be .
If your work is balling , balls .
If the divine , I asked you to do it , I asked to leave some kind of wonderful wonderful , for a moment , just just just through your site , then " Ole . "
I have the same same your same .
And " Ole ! "
I think I 'm going to teach it .
" Ole ! "
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , you know about some of these projects on genome , what can can meaning and the discovered new genes .
Now we 're beginning a new way , we began to digital biology and now , and now I started to the digital , we 're going to make a new fashion of biology , designing and saying , and I 'm going to saying and saying ,
We 've been trying to bring great questions .
" What is life life ? " It 's something that many biologists I think they 're tented to understand the livels .
We tried to have different approach , reduced to the terms .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome , they were going to spend from the world of the world of the digital world .
Now , we ask the life , we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasm , which is the most small species , which is the most small small small than the little , which you can auty in lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome , the genome of the genome ,
We 're able to eliminate a centinail of the thing about 500 that are here .
But when we see a map , when we go to her mapy , it 's relatively simple .
I think it 's simple .
But when we look at all genes that we can eliminate , one to the time , it 's very improbad that can bring a cellution .
So we decided that the only only only way to progree to say that it was going to be able to be able to make some of these things things are going to make some of these questions .
And so we started the " Posycromosom , we 're going to go a cromosome ? "
And he can the chemistry to make these great molecules that we never have able to create before ?
And , in case , we can do it works , we can work a cromosom ?
A cromosom is just a piece of chemile of chemile .
The speed with that we 're able to digitalize life is going to grow up to the exponential exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , and it 's like , but it 's better .
And our most recent received on a curve on a curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process process is required with a bioetic revision , I began with a bioetic review .
But we found that that we found that DNA is very difficult .
There are thousands of thousands of the world that produces of DNA , of the long , of the long time of 30 to 50 lectable and it 's a codegenerative process : the longer is long , more herrors .
So we had to develop a new metodo , and we have to make these framments and corrors .
And this was our first tenty , in particular , in the digital of the digital genome of Phi 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills .
We designed the framments , effectured the corretion of the errors and get a molecule of about 5,000 lectable .
The interesting part is when we 've got this piece of chemile , and we 've got it in the bacteria , the bacteria , the bacteria , and we 've inside this genetic particles and produced the viral particles .
The viral particles are going to leave the cells , they 're back and they distruted and distruted the Ecocoli .
I talked about the recent of the industry of the oil of the oil of the oil that they 're certainly compress .
They remember .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his own own own own own own own own own own system .
But we wanted to do the larger things .
We wanted to build the whole cromosom of the battery of the bacterium .
I 'm more than 80 miles .
So we thought we thought about the virus of the virus of virus , so that we could change the seven seven to understand what they are the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial projection , and if we start with the digital computers in a computer , these have to be accurate .
When we sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 the accuratept of a herror for every 10 miles .
We found , we found it , 30 errors , 30 errors . If we used that sequence that sequence we never have to be able to do it .
One of the process is designed 50 lectells 50 lectelling that you have to be able to build the more more than 50 lectable to build sound ,
We 're going to look at the only here .
You know , you know that we 're going to do that in the floor .
And then , think we have a genetic code on four lectiny on four lectable .
Then those of those lectells , they 're about 20 minods , and there 's a specific order to be able to lectiny for every friend .
So we can use the genetic code to writing words , almost , you think about it .
What we did in the beginning is the self-draw .
Some of the fact that it was not in the fact that it was not poetry .
We designed these segments for just a little bit just to be untain .
There are them to me that they reparan and put them and put them .
And we started to make the parts , beginning with segments , beginning with five to segments , unended it to form segments of 24 mile , and they go to 72 mile them to them .
And we have these segments in the squends in a squends so that we 're going to create a process that we 're going to create a process of creating a process .
We 're trying to automatize the process process .
So , this seems to be a player of a player .
When we 're going to these segments very long , more than 100 mile , more than 100 mile , they 're going to be directly in the Ecoli .
It 's the limit on the limit of the biology of biology .
So we 've been a other monecisms .
We wanted to get another mechanism called recombination ination , which in biology , which in biology , which is going to repark the DNA .
Here 's a example .
This organism , called Deinococed , it 's going to be assumping three million rad of radiation .
You can see in the sudddanger as his cromosom .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled as before .
They have thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can sex completely .
They can live under the vacacross .
I 'm asked , it 's life exist in space , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know ,
It shows the NASA has shown that this is .
This is a picture of the molecules that we built these processes , just use these processes , just use the property of the segments of the segment of the segment of the property .
The light-assemble .
This picture was not wrong with a microscope with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a lot of a great microscope that we can see with a microscope with a microscope .
These are pictures that they 're a period of about six seconds .
This is the public advertionally .
I 'm more than 580,000 lectells .
It 's the largest molecule of a definition of the largest man .
It 's a fish sometimes in 300 million .
If you 're going to be with a carried of 10 , you would like 142 page , you would like this code .
Now , how do we do it ?
Oviously , tradly , a virus is a game .
It 's a little more complicated when they use the batterns .
It 's more simple , when it 's the biggest cell , as our lives , you just recognize the nucleo and inserious , which is basically the process of clonation .
In the bacterium battern is integrated inside the cells , but we recently depended that we 're able to do a transpent , but we 're able to do a transpent .
We 've got a cromosom , by a microbial species .
The two are different as the men from the tops .
We add some gene , in the most way to decide that I can figure out of this cromosome .
And then the scientist , and then I killed to kill all the protected .
And when we put it in the cells is study , and apprecise you , and apprecise our grapproviding -- the new cell .
And we thought we were that we don 't even go to the way , but we 've tried to spend it .
This is one of the most monecisms of evolution .
We found that we found that a lot of a third or a third , a third of a hundream of new new trately new trately new trately , and that species .
So who think about the evolution as a time that 's time that modic time that modic .
They were the result of the restriition of restriition of the digery , they 're going to tell the digerisn .
The cromosom that was in the cells not .
The cell phula-mosom that we have inserit---------cromosom .
It 's expressed , and it recognition , and it 's like material , the gestrange , and we 're rying it , and we 're running with only the cells and the new cell .
It 's blue because of the genes that we 've inserious .
And in a short of time , all the carring of a species of a species , and it 's turned out of the new species , and it 's turned out in the new software that we involved in the cells .
All the protected protected , the membraning , and when we go the genetic code , and when we go .
Now , this might look like that , but it 's going to be altering the software , but it 's going to change the things in the major sustained .
Now , I 've already explained that here don 't talk about genespan , but of the project of three million years and a half of evolution , and I said that we 're going to create a new version of the Cambrian that we 're going to create new new new species .
Why do it ?
I think it 's enough of course , when we think about our needs .
We 're going to go to six billion and half a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each other , in 1946 , there 's four .
We 're going to find issues , water , water , water and they 're site and inside , medical and a half billion and a half billion and a half billion people .
It 's still more draw it for nove billion .
We 're more than five billion , more than five billion , more than 30 billion baries .
It means it it 's car million baries .
When we 're trying to find biologic processes , or any kind of process to record them , it will be a huge sfidd .
We have to keep all the emission of CO2 of the CO2 of these materials that finished in the atmosphere .
At day , I 'm going to the coveries of scientific , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the components for the future .
The industry is just a dozen , just a dozen about components , and think about how many different things are .
Our limits here is the principlally biological data and our imagination .
Now , we have these techniques , thank you very much of the synthization , we can make what we call genomics genomics .
We 're able to build a big robots that can produce a million cromosomes that can produce a million cromosomes .
Think about the processing of these different genes or different , or to try to be a lot of the processes , and they can change or drugs or drugs , we can change , and create more biology , we can change , and create more biology , and create more biology that in the last 20 years of the last 20 years of the the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a selection .
We can choose to be able to survive , production , production , production , production of the vaccines .
This is a lot of some software , and a software , we working for to be able to be able to be able to the computer species .
Well , we don 't necessarily as they will be .
We know exactly the genetic code .
We 're concentrating suging on the cooken .
You also seen you that you can get a site from the gran was a finite finished .
We have carbon others and third generation that will use enough to be the coal of the biggest cookchery , or different kinds of butanthrow or different kinds of butanole .
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without a largest cost of the food and limitate the food and limitate displonger , and limitate the CO2 , which we 're working for the CO2 months that we 're working for the cell that they 're working for the first , and we think that 's what we 're thinking about about about 18 months .
The solar solar solar CO2 is a metodow -- but in our discoveries in our world , we found different .
This is a organism that we 've described in 1996 .
You see in the ocean , about 2500 feet , about 2500 feet of the water of ebollions of water .
They put up from the CO2 , we 're going to idrogene molecular energy .
We 're trying to understand if we can understand if we can indog CO2 , that can be translate , that can be translate , convertional that .
For that we think we can be able to be able to be able to car what the question of the question of the base that the question is life , " We have the modly , we have moving . We have modly run the entire industry .
And you can 't do it from TED , where you can 't do it ?
It would be a main the bottom of energy .
And we 're working for the same metods of the same way to create vaccines .
You 've seen this year with the influence , we 're always back to a dollar , and with a dollar when it 's a right .
I think what you can change it 's going to build vaccines in the ancise .
And here 's how the future could start to look like , now , the high of evolution , accerating the evolution of evolution with batterns , and inside the batterns , and infinally , and infinally , and infinally , and infinally , and infinally , and inside the end of the future , and infinally , and inside the end of the future of the evolution ,
We 're so so by the best people .
Our is to live enough to live enough to live enough to be able to be able to make it . Thank you very very much .
And I 'll give you the most rapidly possible , the most rapidly possible , some fundamental technology that we 've taken to the Microsoft in the following Microsoft .
It 's a further in that you can interact is in the local level that you can interest with a huge amount of data .
And we 're seeing a very gabyte picture of the digital pictures with a species of zoom , and it 's continues , to a quick , and I 'm disponing the picture as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these are great and the data of data or the data .
Most of the photographes , digital photographs , but this for example is a provide from the Biiiiiiished by the Congress , and reentered in the gamapixel .
It doesn 't have any difference because the only thing that the limit is the most of a player system like this is the number of like this is the number of pership . It 's also a very simple architecture .
This is a book , you don 't have data data .
This is the Casa desolated of Dickens . Oggggames .
For shows you that it 's just about the test and not images , we can do something like that , to see that it 's a representation of a representation of the test , not a picture of pictures , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial .
It doesn 't want to be .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the Look .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And it 's going to you and the beautiful experience of the site of the version of a quote of a quotidian or a quotidian , which is to a lot of medical .
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of the Look .
We 've created a fasules the solutionary , it 's a very more alone of what it is because it 's a normal advertic . And we 've ind the content .
If you want to see the carring of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other model , or even specific specific technic .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We 're going to be able to put up and other downers and other downers , not have to be necessary .
And , of course , the mapplications is one of the most of the most of the most of technology .
And on this , I don 't want to say that we have to say that we have to say that we have to give it in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. .
So now we 're going to do something else .
This is actually by the visual web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research , very interesting to the computer very interesting , one of the University , one of the Washington , with the University of Steve Steve Steve Microsoft Research Microsoft Research Microsoft Research .
And it 's from the WWWWWWWestion .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can spend from a picture of the other and have this kind of experience , and this kind of resolution .
But the collocation of the pictures here has been a meaning .
The algorites of the computer computer have recorded these images together , so that they 're sitting these images , and the images that the images that the picture -- all the pictures , you know , all the other other things , they 're going to the Montagaghi Rocococcades .
I don 't know if I 've been time to show you another environment .
There are some more spaces .
I want to spend one of the data of the original data of Nohy-to-prototype of Phototype of Phototypes of Photosynth , that we did work for the first time the first time , I 'm really cave the first time , the perspective . And it 's not necessarily . And it 's not necessarily looking at the webssite . And it 's not not necessarily looking at .
We had to worried us about the wait and on .
This is a rebuild of Notice , Notice Dame picture of Notice . Bax digitate . Bax digitate Notice Din Flickr and you get pictures , other wake and on the other wake . On the other wind .
So , they 're all images from Flickr and they 're all the free of the space .
And it 's possible to be navigate this way .
You know , I would never have thought about the end of the end of the Microsoft .
It 's very gratificant , this kind of across here .
I think that you 're going to see that it is a lot of different kinds of different kinds of different different phone , which is what the professional phone , SLR , a number of SLR , a number of meaning , and it 's a number of different different different .
And if you get to be , I 'm going to try to be what much more strange .
Many of the cheap , etc .
You have a few part here is a series of photograph , I know .
This is a poster of Notice Dame recorded .
We can go to the vision of the vision of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do with the environment . This is now now now . This now is going to be able to the ground , from the whole thing , from the visual , and visual visual , and visual visual data .
All the pictures becomes together , most of the sound of the parts of the parts .
You have a model of the Earth 's interest that emerge .
Think about this as a free of Stephen Lawler 's site on Earth .
It 's something that grow up in complexity , and the people that the people use , and the people that you 're going to get the huge of the hydropped .
They have pictures are pictures with other people .
If someone is the idea of the idea of the idea of the saying , my picture of the site of Notice , my picture of Notice Do Dadaddress , and the data , and the data I can use that you , and the data of the data , using the way to the universe , using the universe , using the other side of the universe , I 'm a red photographs , and have a red red red red a cysis .
And in the following of all of this is model of virtual , extremely elaborated , and you don 't even seen it as well as well as well as you can see the pictures and the pictures and similar .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand what your software ? What your software going to do is that there 's a certain point , in the next years , all the photographs , all the photographs , all the the world are going to be ?
AA : Yeah . What 's doing is doing is what it is discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , you , between images .
And it 's doing it in the base of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting , if you think about the information of the secity of the secity that many of these images .
As when you do a research of images on the web , you digit on the web , and the page of the Sweb has a picture of pictures of pictures .
Now , what happens if that pictures you have the pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of the amount of the amount of rich is really huge . It 's a very effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's incredible .
AA : Vringrated .
One of the main piece , when you travels and one of the research of the research of the research of the research that you don 't have the antial antial , who 's the wind the past , and the wind the wind , the wind of the floor , you , I guy it 's floor , it 's the floor of the floor .
And the thing that sciently Jaguar visual Via , and the Via Lattea , or that the mites of the Inuit 's still college , or the good , or Himalaya , the good way , and the important of Dharm , to remember the important way to remember the important thing that the world 's idea that the idea that the world 's idea that the idea that the world 's idea that the world is not just a sense of the idea that the idea that the world ,
The consequence of a particular squence of the adaptations that our standrds , well , well , well , a lot of generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of trators .
All we all . We have . We do .
We 're going to get the beginning of beginning .
We need to do the inesorability of dead , so we don 't surprising and balloon and balking --
We all have a lot of .
What they 're the run is the particular of the song of the song of the dance of the dance of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they 're the forests of the Borneo , or the following Vodow of Haiti , or the wind of the wind , or the wind of the Anya , or a wake of Anya , or a wake , or a wake , or a wake in the heart of the Saa .
He was my company of my company in the wind a month , or a month , or a high of the driver of the driver of the world .
All these populations teachers are other ways of exise exise people to think , other ways of the model of moving in the world .
And , if you reflected a moment that can give you a place that you can give you .
And then , the miririathy of cultures of the world creating a reaching of life spiritual and cultural cultural planet and cultural planet and cultural well-to be as the ragela .
And you can think about this ragela cultural etnosis , and you can call the etnosis , and you can call the somitnosed , sound , and , inspired , inspiring , inspiring , inspiring , intuitions , inspiring of the human construction .
The etnosis is the great patried patrimonium .
It 's the simble of what we are and what we we can be in how species .
And so that the biosphere was fer consumed by the house is success to the etnosis and purched it .
Nooogist , for example , it would say the 50 percent of all species is , or it 's been on the ororary of the extinction , because it 's fit 's fit , in the pose of different biological -- and not have a more than the poor of the most of the points -- that 's not even more than the other cultural cultural .
The inside it 's all of this is , of course , the losed languistic languistic language .
When you 're nked 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only by a vocabolary or a series of rules .
A language is the spirit of the human spirit .
It 's the midle of the animal of every culture of every culture of every culture .
Every language is a strong , a mind , a backy , a mind , a lot of possibility .
And those 6,000 language , as we 're seduted in Monterey , it 's not more susused in the orececk .
They 're not more teaches the children , which means , you want to say , you don 't go to the children , which are already die .
What is the more trils of the silence of the silence , the last thing about a language , the last linguy , and it 's not going to get the sleep or the ancise of the tellicipate or the tellicipate ?
This is a floor of somewhere in some of the world of every two weeks , every two weeks , two weeks , and a moon and bring the square .
And I know someone of you will say , " It 's not that ?
The world would be a better place if we 're going to leave all the same language , then we talk about it . So we talk about it .
We 're going to go .
You 're going to say , you know , it 's not to talk about the language .
And I would like to do you a journey through the etnosmothnoser .
a small vision in the etnosite of what we 're losing .
Many of us dimented that when I say , " different ways of exist . "
We take example for example this bimber Barasana , in Amazony , the popular of the anaconda , which creating the soult of the lator , that creating the fest challs of the sun of the sacet .
It 's a popular popular that 's not able to distinct the blue , because the the time the bird , because the the moment of the forest , which depends the popular popular , which depends the popular popular .
They have a strange language and a mathematrimonial , " " examia , " I have you can save a person who I can save a different language .
All of the mitological , they 're in the mitological , they 're in the particularity is that in these families that they 're talking about six or seven , or seven , and it 's a lot of multiple language .
They 're going to keep and then began to talk about .
We can see one of the most interesting of the most interesting of the Waoran Ecuador , the Waorani of Ecuador incredible that had the primate contatts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionary have tented a contact a floor .
They did it from the photographs that they were rying them in pose that they were in a populse that this popular popular , and that this popular of the foresty-sional sional sional dimensional sional dimensional sional dimensional .
They told the pictures from the ground , they were driving a shape or a further and , not find nothing , they 're going to be until the diaveling , and they killed the five missionary .
But the Waorani don 't just killed the straniesterday .
They killed between them .
The 54 percent of the mortality was caused by them .
We 're going to be a generations and we found two dead of morning and when we 've got two dead , and when we 've got a lot of them that one of them was invected that it was inside . And then they died it , and then they killed the same .
The crawers were able to recognize the urina , and recognize the species .
In the first years , I was asked me a really interesting company when my professor , I really asked me , I asked me me me , I wanted to go to Haiti and the secret of the power of Duvice and the examse of Duvice and the imself , and I can immesser the window of the velenced and make the walked up and do the wind .
For a sense to give a mile , I would have to do the culture Vodouldn 't have to make the Vodoo is not magnine .
It 's a further of a complex complex metaphyfish .
Many interesting .
If you ask you , I say , the great religions of the world , what you do ?
Cristanesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent , I think about the sub-Souan Africa , I think the sub-Souan Africa . And he said , and the Vodoo , and the Vodoo is not that the distills of these things that religious concepts of these religious concept of these things that we 're waaait .
What makes interesting to make the voodoor is the intense is the lives of life and dead .
So , you live nasked the spiriti .
And the spirites can be inside the Grande Acqua , they say , and they remember to the dance and they remember the site of the visual visual that we go to a short of the following .
For this voodoists , " You can say , " You can go to talk about God .
We 're in the temple and divention and dive God . "
And from the moment that you 're going to do it , you know , how you can do you , how you can you do you , how you can you the mal of male ?
So you 're going to these incredible events : following the voodoor in the state of the touch that they 're going to be able to a piece of the power of power of power of the power of power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power
It was the most strake the most straxed most strather than the Siar Siar Nevada , Santa Marta , Santa Marta , Santa Marta , in Colombird .
It 's a slit of the tish that we live on the planets , they live on the planets of the planets in the planets of the South of the planets , the popular of the played , the popull that you were on the played of the played .
In a continent drug , this popular , this popular is never been conquire to the spages .
And so , it 's government today , but their formation is the way , it 's really extraordinary .
The young gers came to the families of the families , and live in a world made of good world . And they live in a world made of good and base in the world of the base of the game of the game of the game of the games of the game of the games of the game .
Two days of the nove years of the proposition of the nine of the nine months of gestation that they transrate in the mother , now I 'm throw in the mother of the Grance MMMfather .
For all this time , they 're acculturned to the values of their society , values that their preciate and only their prepreprepreprepreciate the cost of that -- or to say , or for the best , or to say the ecological ecological ecological .
Aterm of this incredible beginning , they 're going to be taken out and the first time , in the age of 18 years , they see a 18 years , they see a albad . And that the first crazy of the first crazy , when the beautiful value of the beautiful values of the beautiful value . The fer is going to the favied . The free .
" Do you know how I said , I said ,
It 's study . Now , it 's to you . "
They call them more than the most people say that we , frattempts and they 're the colors of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the populations and the environment and the environment , and the old old story of the noble self-self-self-self-self-invoices , and we say that these popular popular and the world 's the war of us .
The popull is not nership is nership , is indeboles from nostalloes .
There is no space for these things in the palures of the disease of the Tibet , but thank you , and I went , and I realit , they created a mistics of the Earth Earth 's basically , they created a mistics of the Earth 's going to be unliving , but it 's going to be a humans .
What does it mean ?
And I mean , a kid of the Ande of Ande that the mountain , that the mountain is a spirit of the Apu that it will be a human destine . It will be a human destine . It 's going to be a different .
It 's the dimage of one was irrighter or a mineral cyourself is irrifer .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that we defines the report between the individual of the individual individual world .
I was grown in the forests of Columbia credating that the forest , and they 've been wrong .
And I 'll realized a human being in my friends Kwakiutl that credays that credate that the forest and the douth of Hukukuk and the spiriters of the world , and the spiriters that we live in the world , explained the world , explailed that they live in Hamath .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different different , you can start to understand some of them , and we can start to understand some of their sensitional sensitive .
I 've been screed this picture in Amazony the nordoccial .
And if some of you have heard of the ayahuasked , the most powerful powerful sssmot of the scianic ,
What major fascinating the ayahuasn 't the power of the power of sustaurant , but his elaboration . It 's composition . It 's composition .
And he was a layer , this lian nothing that contains a series of coooline , harmine , slightly , laws .
And I remember the solar solar blue that alters a little bit of the cool that , but it 's mile , but it 's mile of the family of the family of the family of the coffee of the Psychototage .
This plant powerful swait .
If you 're going to see the Yanomi , you 're going to the sustained , they 're going to have a different species of species , and that 's extremendous methoyptamine .
Tirare that polly on the nasked , it 's a little bit like to be spared by a field of the wind , and repeared on a mate patterns and repear .
I had often oftes , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who gave the man who gave the psychec , with her psycheel , with her fungets in the 190s .
I 'm my tiny , you can 't get these tripes like this , and you don 't tell you why if you 're not done to tell any of it . You can 't tell any of it . " And you can 't tell any of the slightamine , because they 're money to be a lot of course , because they 're in the ininden , because they 're in the indemondiny , I 'm not even even even even even .
And it 's possible to sumercies only if you just like it , with other sustauran MAO .
Now , the beautiful : the beautiful : the coooline that they find in this lian injectors , the same kind of the same kind of slian . The samine ine ine ine . The soubt of the south of the popull , as they do these two of the popull two , but I think that if you 're not a lot of a swadow , and it 's a such a such a such of the slian inemistale .
We use the great eusually emimimimimimimisphere , which can revehiced .
But if we ask the Indians , they will say , " The piece of the people talk . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , he 's 17 variety of ayahuasy , which we 're going to our eyes , and that we 're going to our eyes in the same species .
If you ask them like it , you know , they 're going to say , " I thought , " I thought , " I thought I was going to figure out , I don 't know it ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : they 're going to be a night of a night of a night , and obnect , and obnect .
And I don 't know , you know , it 's very interesting that to be interesting that content .
Now , [ [ [ the problem is that the problem is that they also have to be the popull of us , they 're going to be pitting , but some way to our world , but it 's going to our redotts of the story of the world , and it 's beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it 's not remember to his driver or his innovations , but I like the world we 're standed and we 're stmed and we 're stmed and we 've been free free . Now , we 're going to be a great destruction of the planet . Now it 's not change . Now , the problem .
All cultures through the secos have been involved in a dance for new possibilities .
And the problem is not the technology .
The Indians Sioux don 't have to be Sioux when they put it out of the argue and fashic as the American , they don 't have to be American , when they put it beat the hind .
It 's not the change or technology that they mind the integrity of the etnosmot .
The domination of the domination .
And if you say , you know , I 'm going to the world , you know that these are not cultures ,
They 're creatures and dynamics and spint out of the identific forces that will be able to adapt .
And I think it 's trately disboy in the patria of the thinking of the inside of the thinking .
a popular Sarawak , in the sud-asiatest , a popular populum that lived in the forested forestyle , and now it 's going to the servites , and now now it 's going to the prostitution of the inside , where you can see the husequently involved in the Minnership of Minese Minese Cinese Minese Minese Cinnaveling Minese Minnerpopulation , where the Millumine , where you can see the Cordern .
You take the standing standing with the lexide ,
Or , in the case of Yanomi , are the disease that are the disease that are coming with the cost of the gold .
If we 're on the mountain of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you see the political of political domination .
As the genocide , the extinction of a popular popular , is condannotion , but the etnocide , the destruction of life , but the stroyle , not only is not just condition , but it 's not only condge , but it 's part of the development of the development of the development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet of the Tibet , until you don 't know ,
I lose the 6,000 miles from Chindu in China , in the Tibet , the sudgt , you get to Lhasa ssue , but only came to a young , but only came to Lhasa , I just get the statistics , but only I 've got to talk about .
6,000 monuments , saces in pollen , and cency .
1.2 million people killed the Right Cultural Right .
The father of this girl was ascritical to the Panchen Lama .
The way to say that it was killed to the Chinese inese inese inese .
Souter is floor with Sanity , Santity the deah , which has bring the popular popular .
South mother was free and his colpa was remember .
It was taken of nasked to the age of two years old old , the landander of two years , he wouldn 't have any any of him .
The sister , which has been been mesis , was mesis ,
A day he was going to be calculated a fashion a raffer , and this transgression , and this transgggression , it was mespecially ,
The Tibet can be insuputable , but the spirit of the popular of popular is from hard .
And then , finally , all of it 's a choice .
We want to live in the world world 's world 's monocromatics or we want to have the world polooowny of different different sity ?
The great anthropoga Mead , before he said that his bigger said that his bigger was that , in our prise , we don 't just see the world , not just the intergamma .
And it 's a million remember that our species is there for 60,000 years .
The Neolitical solution , which has gone , it gered the agriculture , which has done us to the culture of the seme , sustained the poetry of the scientertainly , creating the gerarchy of the specific , creating the bottom of the special , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The world world 's world has been 300 years .
And that 's any story not suggests that we have the answers that we have the answers that we 're going to get to the millens .
When you do these miriaxes of cultures is asked what they want to say to be human , and they say with 10,000 different voes .
And it 's in these risis that we all risis that we all risis that we 're going to be what we are .
I wait this picture on the northern north of Baffin , when I went to the Baffin the Baffin , and this man , and this man , Olayer , Olaya , Olaya , and he tells the wonderful story .
The government is not always been gentle with the popular Enuit and in the 1950 to stay our summmmatic , we have inchieve them in colonies .
The grandander of this man is going to go .
The family , the family , the family , the brought up all of the arms , and all the your own .
You know that the Inuit 's not the cold , they don 't know the cold .
The syes of the slites were made of fish were made of fish .
The grandander of this man doesn 't fintimile or the night or the night , or from the puffered .
It 's sgattle , it 's crow , it 's cut the pantalloons and defocused to the hand . When the hand . When the old hand . When you do a lama .
It 's sprended on the door of this physical college and when they go , he killed a cane .
It 's a slie , and created a brillier , with the cases , with the cases , it has a sliterally , he imum a sliter , and it 's slight-blood .
We want to talk about it with anything ? [ [ Risland . And this , in different ways , in different ways , [ Apauses .
In the U.9 , 1999 the government of the Inuit 's control of the total control of a territorary of California and Texas .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunaveling .
It 's a territority . We know ,
One of the splenance of how a national national national state can recognize with his popular .
And , I think it 's a little bit of course , I think it 's been in these zone of us , we make it remote that they don 't have remote .
For someone is home .
They represented the human imagination of human imagination , they 're going to the high . And for us all of these children , like the sogames of our children , and they 're part of the swisdom of hope .
For finally , we have to do Geographic we convince that political people never arrive .
We believe that the polemiles .
[ Apasive , they 're not lolose , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the world , and maybe we are the best institution for stories of the world . Ogymen .
156 countries , we have our sal site .
Our revided by million people .
Our work is traving our public public , and we have a wonderful place in the slights of the wonderful cultural , and I hope , you hope , absolutely hope , absolutely , and we hope , and we have a lot of the world 's world 's worlddle , and we have a game of a world .
which is the saggeness of all populations can contributs to our well-to our well-.
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I 've written in this book that I hope you 're already to be .
I want to start with what I call the dogma , " the dogma . "
The doggame of what ?
The dogggame of all society , the dogggame , the dogggma , " If we want to massive the benefit 's going to be the citizens of our citizens . " The way to do is massive individual . "
The reason is , from a late , in fact that the liberty is in the same value , it 's precious , essential , essential , essential beings .
In the other is in fact that if we are libes , each of us can act all of us to do everything that that massive massive , we don 't have any one that we decide to be , not nobody that we 're going to be in our nothing .
The way to massive massive liberty is massive to get the choice .
And the people have , more liberty , more liberty , and most liberty is their liberty , most of the liberty is their benefit .
This , I record , it 's so foundly radiced in the society that nobody would have to put it in the soubt .
And it 's also proached our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what the project has been able .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly .
I can 't get a simple note to save .
In my supermarket there are 175 condments , without content the 10 variety of the extrens of the Each , and 12 acetes , and the 12 acetes that you can busical a number of conditious numbers in the including of the indeed , and it 's not a number of your degrees .
That 's the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic electronic to buy one stereo : you know , slector , radio , like the right , radio , like the right , the lefer .
And in this single single negoties , there is a great number of components .
We can make six million and half of different combinations that we use the components that there are a gotic negotic .
You can have to love that there is a very sceld .
Altri : the world of the world of the world of the world .
And once , when I was a kid , they could get all the phone , they could get all the desive , path that they were sitting by the mom .
It was game the phone , they didn 't buy it .
One consequence of that , between the other , was that the phone , it was that the phone .
These tempes .
Now , we have a variety of phone , specially , specially between the phone .
Here 's the future of the future .
My favorite is in the midle , the MP3 , the wrong of the nail , and forforward for the nake .
If you don 't have seen in the home , you 're not in the home , you 're going to take it .
And what happens is that people do is that people go into the negogoes and ago . You know what is the answer answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do it .
So , in other things that are very important of the people that are very important of the people , you know , the same exight-scape .
Assistency : it 's not the United States that you 're going to go out of the doctor and the doctor , what you do you do .
And I mean , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , " Ok , you can do . " And you can do . " And these became , and these risks and these risks and these risks and these risks and these risks and these risks and these risks . "
You know , " Dottore , what I should do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefit and these risks and these became answer and these risks and these risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you can get it , " Dottore if she was me , what would do you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I don 't have . "
The result , we call " autonomy of maled , " autonomy of the disease .
But it 's not a fish , and the fish and the responsibility of the decisions to someone that , you know , it 's the doctor , whatever , and so that you don 't know -- and so it 's not a sense of the codeal , and so it doesn 't have to make decisions the patient .
There is a huge marketing of products , direct people like me , and you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why we can 't do them them ?
The answer is that they want to domorning , we call the doctor for the doctor to change it .
And so that 's the fundamental as is our identity . It 's a sceld of choice , like you see it . " We don 't want to get the children children . " We don 't want to get the right right now . "
And we can invent how many times we can do it .
The thing that every morning , the answer , you know that kind of person wants to be .
I spect to the family and the family , a time time , a spective time , and they were going to be that there was the most price , and it was that we could get the most price , and began to the most price .
The only one of the only one who was , not when you do , and it 's not when I do .
On it 's really , it 's really to play .
I mean , very smart students , and I have the 20 percent in less than the work .
And it 's not because they 're not because they 're not because they 're not because they 're not because they 're not because they 're saying .
But why I 'm impensies , I mean , I would say , " I would say , " I would say , I would say that I do that ? "
" I would like to do it , I had to think before the the bottom or the bad ? "
I 'm interrogatic .
And they 're trying to say to these questions , even though this improved the componies that you have to get a vote , and I don 't get a vote to my exame .
And they have to do it . They 're important .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , as Carl soon , because the technology technology to be working on every day , every day , every day , every day , every day , the site of the planet , the Hotel Randolph .
It was parently , there 's a angle , and I don 't say , where the WiFi .
I don 't say , because I want to use I .
What means , this incredible liberty of choices that we have about it ? And that we have to go to work . And if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son son , with the game , with the cell phone , the Blackberry in the other , and the noteam , and the name , and the nice , and the nice .
And even though they 're all spent , every minute that we see our son , we 're also asking the partment , we 're also asking this called "
" I said , " I said to this email ? "
And also when the answer is " no , all this makes the experience of your douth ddriving , very different than what it would be in other conditions .
So , by any part of the things , small , things , and the great , objects and the lives of life , life is a question of scels .
On the world was this : Ovue , there were some chance , but not all the way .
The world today is the world of today : The dilemma is , " It 's one thing , or negative , or negative ? "
The answer is South .
The slies , we all know , so I 'm talking about the negative .
All this choices two effects .
The first , paradosally , is that produces inside .
With the floor , which I wait , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I offer an example , a further , a studio , a further of fly depensionation .
A college of the data of the data of Vanks , the gigantesis , the gigantesis , with about a million clients of clients , with about a million clients of clients .
What she found is that it for every 10 solutions that they 're offering in the more , the lose of the lower , the lower of two percent .
With 50 feeling , there is the 10 percent in less than adesions , when they 're disponble only five . Why ?
Because with 50 bottom of what the wait , is maleded to decide , and the choices is to decide , and the weld the questions .
And I 'm asked , and I still questions , and the questions , and of course , and of the questions , and of the questions , and of the questions , and of the questions , and of the questions , and the questions , and the questions , and the questions , and of the questions , and the questions , and of the questions , and of the questions , and of
You know that you don 't mean that these work on the old old old old food for the food for cancans , because they don 't have enough money , it means that the decision is so ostic , they also say that the decision of the work of the work of work .
Not not talking about it , they 're allosed to five dollars to the dator , that would be bad .
So the paralysis a consequence of the having of the choices .
And I think that 's the world .
" And I finally , the eternity : ketchup , send , send , send it ? "
You 're just going to take the decision , if it 's the right ?
You don 't want to choose the bottom , and you can 't want to get the wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can get the paralysis , and to do a sceld , at the end of how we 're not going to be as as we would be able to be as a recognize that the choices .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of these is that I wait , if you buy , if you buy a lot of imagine that you can imagine that you can have a different scale of different that it would be better . And what happens is that happening is that happening is the better . And that 's the wake up and the record the smart of the free , and the further , and the decision of the decision ,
And when it was a decision .
And the choice , there are more easy , more easy is easy of any driver that is insoddisdisdisdisdisdisfacing .
And there is what the economies call the opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has asked very good stamine as that we see the things that we see the things that we see that the confronties .
In the rest , when there are many options , it 's easy , it 's easy to be less , and it 's not a soddisdisdisdisdiscovered and be less , and it 's not floor .
Here 's a example . I 've been . I 've been New York .
But it 's what you probably think about it .
There is this copy to the Hamptons .
A place of luser .
It 's going to splenon . Ottim . It 's all for them .
It 's not like that he said , " Well , what he said , " Well , it 's Agod . "
" All my neighbor , I 'm on . "
" I could talk about it right to me . "
And I 'm going to get two weeks , that 's allow , which is allosing -- the possibility of park where it wants .
The opportunity to be the soddiscovered the soddisfation for what we have , even when the choice was old .
And the most of the options that we 've got more than the characteristics that we 've got to get the opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This vignize us us us a lot of things .
We talk about the moment , and maybe of live lently .
But the most important point is that any thing you can choices , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
The things that we don 't wrong the tant things that can make less attractive what we do .
I can see it 's going to grow .
I tried on my patterns a new couple of jeans .
It 's almost always jeans .
And I 've got a jeans were a kind of patterns and vestian , they were dissign , they were dissign , just after they were a living and working on a lot of times , they were going to go .
So , I went to buy a new couple when the old old old , and I said , " I 'm going to the old of jeans , and I 'm a couple of jeans , this is my touch . "
The fit said , " Let wants to slim , easy , relaxed , relaxed ? "
Who wants with the bottons or the bottons ? " Stonewashed or " " " acident " " " " Dahhand ? "
" Where wants to strange ? "
" Sotle them want them to the ble , the ble -- " Continured ? "
I was sbalordit , and after a little bit , and after a little bit of that -- I want the only kind of that -- that was the only one of what it was , so for a time , I know , you know , then you all the disease , then you know , the wall of the best jeans , I won , with the wind the best jeans , I 'm going to have .
It was the massive massive .
But I felt ,
Why ? I said a book to understand it .
The reason I was going to be worst is that I was that I was going to be perfected , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was wait . I didn 't expect me . I don 't expect anything else when I exist when I exist when I 've got a kind of 100 different , you know , you 're a kind of a lot of a lot of a lot of that .
What I had to do was good , but not perfect .
I 'm talking about the wait to the weld with what I was insudden in the wait .
The options of the people of people don 't do the people don 't expected to be the answer that these have respond to the eection of options .
And this protection will be less soddiscover , when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing world 's marketing .
Because if you know , you don 't know what I 'm talking about about .
The most like this is more than that .
" And he was better when he was worst when he was better when he was better when he was better when he was better when he was worse when he was worse , he was still possible to be able to meet .
On the world we live -- opulents , the industry , industry , industry with the expected citizens -- the massive massive things are going to hope is that the altitude of the expectitiative .
You never have surprised because the voice , the miathing , the miathing , you 're ingigantons .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- it 's here -- is , " Yes , " Yes , " Yes , " Yes , " Yes , " Yes , " Yes , " Yes , " Yes , " Yes , " Yes , " Yes , " Yes , " Yes , " Yes , what you 're going to do
I mean , a little moment , that I 'm really recently , I 'm really spot and it 's really really really really think .
I won 't have to do better , I don 't have to do it .
But it 's not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of jeans , and I said , " Well , there 's just that when you don 't sit , and you ask you , and you ask you , and you ask you ? "
" Where is responsible ? " " The answer is .
The world is the world is the responsible . What might do you do it ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you can buy a sleep , and you ask , and you ask that you , and you ask that the responsible , it 's the responsible that responsible to you .
You have to do better .
And we have a lot of variety , there 's not wrong the insuccess .
So when people are going to make it decisions , even though the result is there , they 're insuddddry and year the colpa and doubt , and they will the same .
In the last depression is expression in the world world .
I think a meaning of a fairly , not the only , but important -- this ongs of depression is just that people have experiences because the standard of the people who are too alts .
And when they have to explain this situation is they think the colpa .
So the end end of the end is that we 're better , objected , but we heard worst .
Let me remember .
This is the doggma , what we all take for good .
There 's no one of a little that a little bit of choice is not better than it 's not not going to do that , but that 's not like this .
There is a critical value , magic value .
But I 'm sure we have been supered by a piece of the level where the best lives .
Now , from the political point -- I 've been in the political point -- from the political point of political , the nocle is the following following .
What you allow all of this choices in the industry is the remember .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , which the problem is that the problem is that they have a choice .
The problem is that they 're too powerful .
For that I 'm talking about that I 'm talking about is a diseases of modern , remember that society .
And what it does depriming and arring is this : Steve Levitt talked about how they 're talking about how they are and discovered . It 's a lot of money . It 's a further . It 's a spaes of money .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dispends , it 's not just inutiles .
I 'm aditting the elected .
They do it worst .
If you have a little bit of what in our society , they 're going to be site in those people where people have too powerful , it would be not only their lives , but also our lives , but also our lives .
This is what the economies called a better better paretian paretian worthian worthian works .
A reddistribution of the reddied , not just to poverty -- not just to poverty -- it 's going to be able to be .
For conclude : " Fanky , you can become everything that you want to be --
You can , people think , you think , you think , what creds this fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't do the news . "
" United States , a limited , a limited of the world -- "
And I 've been ined so , I 've been so , in the beginning .
But then , I think , I 'm going to do , I realized that that fish .
Because the reality of fact , if you eat , you know , it 's how it 's possible . " And that 's all possible . " You don 't get the liberty .
If you 're going to be the bottom , it 's all possible to be defation .
At the paralysis , and reduced the well-being .
