The year I showed these demonstrate demonstrate that the glacial rate , which is almost three million years had the size of 48 million years had the United States continental dimensions , it 's reduced 40 percent .
But this is that gravity , the gravity of the problem because I don 't show the specaction of the ice .
The calculation is , a very artical way , a sense , the cuputting sense , the cubulating climate system .
You can extinced and you can get to extate .
The next next to be a rapid is going to be a focused on the last 25 years .
The ice ice lost of draw , they 've got in red .
As you see , you can see , you know , you can see it .
That 's the ice , that 's the ice in inverage , that you can get extate .
You can see that the ice ice ice , you can see that the ice , of five years , is like the sangue , which is the sangue , which is that there 's a site .
In 25 years , it 's past so ,
This is a problem because the whole scale of the whole threatened , the third of the ocean artical scale , where there are hyourself , scientists , they 're going to be true , they 're transformed in metimes .
I realize the totality of the atmospring of the global scale , that quantity could be able to be able , that quantity could be drify , superhaped this point of the wasn 't .
In some laghi , the site in Alaska , the metry is already rebuling on the water .
The professoresthorous professorer in the University of Alaska , the team was reverse with a lower .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You 're good . The question is if we 're going to be .
A reason is that this termal environment is the termal scale .
This is a further to me that .
The brought had never reached them .
This is the Kangerlushic Kangerlusaq , in the sud-west cheel .
If you want to know how to do the ice level of the ice of the ice of the ice , you want to get the ice , here is where you reach the mare .
These corrents are are caught .
Another part of the planet : Antartide , the biggest block of the planet .
The month , the scientists have died that the slighion , and that the walking , and that the Antartarttttarttttarly , which is particularly rapiece of the hyourself , it 's particularly rapic .
It 's a six meters of the across the site , like Groenland .
Himalaya , the third bigger , the third of ice , they 'll see new laghi , who few years ago were gacier .
The 40 percent of the mondial population was going to the water .
Sulle Ande : this ice is the source of the water of the water .
The brought was caumented .
But when it dimines , the same happens , the same happens .
In California , the Sierra Nevada is the Nevada is 40 percent .
The crisis in crisis .
The predictions , like you have a graves , they 're graves .
The growth secity growing in the door of the car .
The environmental environmental environmental return out from normal and without precedent .
Four times more number of the last 30 years , the last 30 years .
This is a fursustainable .
If you 're about the context of the context if they can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we add 70 million tons of CO2 , 24 hours every 25 million tons of the ocean in the ocean every day .
Look at the Pacific area , from the American ineately , from the American parts , and both of the subcontinent parts of the subcontinent , where there is a radical imor the poor in the ocean .
Most of the global scale , together , together , with the deforest , which is 20 percent , is the huge of commostic combustic commostly .
oil is a problem , and the coal problem , and the coal is even worst .
The United States are one of the two countries with China , together , together , together at China .
And it was propond to build a lot of other coal .
But we 're going to be a change of direction .
These are the designs out , annative projects in the last last years and some some of the versus of the versus of the versus .
Some , there is a lot of political , in our country .
The carbon industries and the oil have speculation , 250 million dollars in the last year for the last year for the carbon , which is a obsimn .
And that picture I remember something --
I can see Natale , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion source of the carbon scories .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the biggest second flow scories in America .
It 's happened around Natale .
The publishing natalizing of a coal of coal .
Video : I 'm going to be the coal , is a cool kind of a allegro and happy .
It 's a loundant here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
Frosty the carbon is always more or .
It 's a good , adorable , adorable and workers , they 're dependent .
Al Gore : Da is free part of the West Virginia .
The biggest society is Massey . This is Massey Coal . This is his love love love .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'm going to the Al Gore , Nancy Peloy-, Harry Reid -- not saying .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Cliance for the Clima has two campaipppay .
This is a part of it , a part part of it .
Video : ALergy : ALergy see the climate change change as a serious climate change .
So , our priority is investment to be an enciaror in a bunch of money in a bad public public truth to make public truth the truth .
It 's actually , the coal is not sport .
We think it 's a good deal -- it also , it 's a good profuse .
So I 'm not preocupatevs .
Let me do us .
Video : Actor : Carbone , you 've heard about a very .
So I did that you have a game in a stryer , the true of the coal .
Stratraordinary ! You 're a little bit , but this is the such of the technology of the technology of the coal technology .
We 're going to coal with the main is the main is the main global warming , but the night technology of the technology that you see changes .
You have a look at this : this is the ownnice technology .
Al Gore : Al Gore : The worth positive , the positive isn issue and that 's the national chemistry .
Video : Coment : The America is in crisis , the national security , the national crisis .
The fallenge that the colleags all of our dependence , as the cool , as the cooil , and the importance of the important cooil .
Now , there 's a new , there is a new , audace solution for use .
Repower , 100 percent of energy , in the 10s .
It 's a plan to put the work of America , it 's going to go to the global warming to stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
Repower . Scover .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's about : It 's to reach energy in America .
One of the most faster moving us to the end of the dependence on the planet .
What it 's the future is here . It 's the future . It 's a new energy energy .
What it 's two : Nuoving investment for places to work for a bought bits .
Comment : Repower . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old old , I 'm provide , " If you want to go fast , you want to go to the fast .
If you want to go to the landed , you go together . "
We have to go away , fast , fast .
Thank you very much .
They 're going to TED feck TED fectraction on the LHC .
And I promise to get to the hornate on how the machine .
So , I 've got to those that another time , there were no , the LHC is the biggest experiment , the most scientific experiment .
his buy is to remember the conditions that were less than a billion from the universe of the universe -- until 600 million times .
All that 's just environment .
This is the Ginevra .
I realized these mini-Bang Bang Bang inside the reflators .
This is what I work . It 's what I work . It 's a 44 feet and has a 22 feet and it has a 22 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS .
10 settember year , we have acceso year , we have acceso the first time .
And this picture was the ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAS .
It 's because of immense it festables in the saving .
It 's a fasm picture that had made everything in the LHC , both , both in collision , from the LHC , and spread in the LHC , and spread particles in the LHC , and spread particles in the reator .
In other words , when we see that the image 10 settember , we understand that the machine was a great vitting , which is a great vitting .
I don 't know if it was this exultate us to be able to Google and vide that the page was this .
That means that we had a cultural impact .
It 's a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to these files here -- these files here -- these files here -- these challs on the sell .
These challenge physics when the machine works in the machine .
Now , the technical technical , they 're going to be true . They 're not true . They 're too sotical . "
And instead can do it because when they 're very cosidans become cosidans .
So , at least 271 , at least 271 , you 're in the space between the stars , these files can bring that corrent the corrent .
In one of the most novehicle yourself in the LHC , there was a faburther of fabbrication .
So the falls realized that they 're going to read , and 13,000 le---rovisually instead of electrical .
This was the result was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think these magnetic magnetic fish , and that 's more than 20 tons , and that you have been about 30 centimeters .
They 're dannear about 50 magnetic .
We had to take them them , what we did .
We had repristined and flowing .
Now , they 're going to all the place to their own place .
And the end of the end of the LHC will be be new integro .
We 'll be going to get up , and we 'll get to juson or sluson or , and keep so our grads , and keep our adventure for the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these reacting debate the dibate value of science and the engineering of science and engineering . It 's easy .
I think the fact that the fact that it 's so hard , I think it 's the limits , I think it 's this value of things like LHC .
I 'd like to conclude with the words of a scientist Inglan Inglan , Humphrey Davy , the image of the inhyle , his pulled , his publisher , his publisher , his publick , he said , " Nichael Faraday , " Norame is that the way for the ideas that the ideas are not definitive .
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to ask you to start thinking when children , children , played with the morning .
So , you know , you know , how to reach them , and they take them and moving them , learn them , learn that you can actually solve them and they 're going to be solve with relations .
The reasoning is profoundly connected to the way we understand the world around us .
So , from the information , inspired by the use of our own own own own own physical interaction , and my collaborator , and my collaborator , I started to my collaborator , I started asking me , I started asking me , " And if we 're a computer , instead of the mouse that model that 's a computer , instead of the model that mother can be able to a physical mom that model of the way ,
and sistemardation to our pliniment ?
The question was so interesting that I decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable , a Siftable computer as a bircocost .
In a few words , a Siftable , a Siftable computer as a bircocost .
You can see the movement , they can see , " You can see the movement of them , and they have a radio screen and a radio radio .
But it 's sofly , they 're physics , like the morrow , they can just move .
Siftable is , example of a new ecosystem for ecosystem .
And as they become more physics , conscious , the other of other , and other , and the other people , and as they become more physics , conscious movement , we can explore new new ways , we can exploring new interaction and different interaction .
I 'm going to do with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurned to show of video : if you 're in a direction , the video raise , the video raim , including on the other side .
These record that interactive is conscious .
If you 're interested in the way , they 're interested in what they 're going to be around .
If they are circusticles , they notice and they can act a little bit .
If they are circusticles , they notice and they can act a little bit .
They 're also going to be their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interaction was the power of the interaction was the power of the interaction was the power of the data , to the example of an example of the color , " an example of the color , " the color , " versation , "
In this case , we have three Siftable configured , and I can use them to use them to the color in the color in the central , where they 're missing .
and I can use them to versate them in the central , where they 're mismissing .
If we 're too , we can put a little bit of a little place .
You also have a beautiful possibility of appear , like languages , the mathematics and logical gaxic , and you see the things fast fast , and you see the results .
Now , I 'm now --
This is a Fibonacusequency that I do with a equations of equations .
Here we have a game of words that is half a Scarababeo and Boggle .
Pratically , at every turn out a letter in every Siftable , Pratically , Pratically , every turn out every Siftable , and as you 're trying to buy words him a letter .
Then , after about 30 seconds , they 're going to be a new new new slectiny , and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came in the Media Lab , I did this way that I tried them and I had a video video .
They 're very fashired .
And one of the things that 's interesting things about this application is that you don 't have to give people many things .
He said , " What 's just " What 's words , and they 're going to be doing .
Here 's other people who are trying to be .
This is our gyoung head , right there .
It was just just just just a fly .
They 're just just going to him .
Now , this is a conversation of a interaction .
We had to build a tool for the landing of the languages is Felix .
It was going to give new personic characters in the sun , soling Siftable , they 're going to Siftable .
It was going to give new personic characters in the sun , soling Siftable , they 're going to Siftable .
And that 's doing it , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The money is surprising .
David Merrill : Now , he took a tractor in the scene .
Video : The tractor : The tractor .
Bel work ! Yeah !
So , schooling Siftable and put up up up the characters can interact with personally --
Video : Bau !
-- inventing their story .
Video : Ciao :
DM : It 's a final story with final , and it can decide that .
DM : It 's a final story with final , and it can decide that .
Video : I 'm going to go .
DM : The last example I 've got the last example of the exact of the recent , I made of recent , to walk and exact music .
It 's a cool , I 've got recent , to walk and exighing music .
Siftable here , they 're agism , based and the battery .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose .
You can inside the inserious suons in a sequency sequency .
And it 's just doing it just just doing a ssue , " and a sequence . "
These are actually actually control from vision , as the reverbs and the filter and the filter .
I 'm going to a particular suit , and then including it .
And then there 's the general , as time and fly , you know , they 're going to the intersequency .
We look at how it works .
Video : We 'll start a base in two Siftable , " We 're going to sequence , " systems , we 're going to get other base , we add other base .
Now I put a line line .
Video : Now , I add the percussions --
Video : And I 'll put the filter , so I can find the battery , so I can control the battery , so I can control the vive .
Video : I can fast the whole sequencing the whole sequencing the time from another .
Video : And I 'll give the phills to the fall over the basis to give more expression .
Video : I can 't recombining the sequence " to the flight . "
So I don 't have to infloor , but I can improved it , I can improved more than the correct or more corport .
And now , finally , I can make the whole sequencing the whole sequencing the Siftable , " fly . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is built to the whole whole thing , you can see the more soon as the body works as our brain and corbody .
And I had a time to show you one of the result of this lost , and some possibility that we 're trying to bring out from the laboratory .
The concept that I want to transmate is that 's coming this new generation of objects for the digital design , that will bring information with digital digital world , that will be able to be .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the now I 'm not going to know .
I 'm a written .
I 'm going to write books is my profession , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also the love and the love of my life .
And I don 't expect me that can change .
But , he said , something particular happened in my life and my life and my career , who took me to remember the whole thing , which was taking me the whole recently recently .
The particular thing is that I 've recently written this book , this biography called Manogy , Prega , Ame , the different thing , the different books , the different reason , for some reason , some reason , and it 's a big sensational , but it 's a big sensational , became a whole thing , became a big , became a big sensational sensational thing .
And the result is that anywhere , people are the people who are condition as if they were condannoed .
Davue -- condanned , condanned ,
They 're going to me all worry and say , " I 'm not going to be able to be able to do better than than you ?
You don 't have to keep writing for all life without power to be able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be important to somebody ? "
that can be important to somebody ? "
It 's rassure , you know .
But it could go to the worse , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started a adolescent adolescent -- I was a writer .
I went to the same reaction of the same gaining .
And people say , " I didn 't told me to do not success ?
Don 't you know that the humiliation of killed ?
Don 't you know , you know , I 'm going to get out of the life without the lifeting of the wind of the model of the both of the both of the both of the both of the pink of the pink ? "
So , you know , you know .
The answer -- the answer -- the answer to all these questions is : " Yes . "
Yes , I 've got all those things .
I 've always had a couple .
And I also have a lot of other things that people could not inside .
As the other things and other things .
But what I was about how I thought , and I was asked to me what I thought , and I was going to be a mentially ?
It 's rational ?
It 's logic that anybody would expected by a job that you have been sent by a work that I 've got to do .
But what 's there is so particularly in the impress creative to make us nervation to health health health of the health of the health of the health of the health of the way they do not ?
How my father , for example , he was a cheeemist , and I don 't remember a money in the lifetime of activity in the asked , if he was asked to be engineeeering ?
Don 't have -- that blown to us John , like ?
Don 't work that ?
Onestly , the engineers , the engineers , they don 't have certainly , in the secos of being alcolized , the reputation of being high .
We writers , we have this reputation , and not just writers , and not just scritters , we have this reputation of being huge mentally instead of being huge .
And it 's not to look at the trilate of the magnific magnific magnific creative , only in the century century , they 're dead , they 're going to hand often .
And also those who are not suicians have been revered by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before I die , in the last last interview said , " Ogn my book had kiler ky a little bit of the work of the work of work .
But we don 't bad the son when we feel because we 've heard these things really really , in some way we 've heard these things that in some way we 've got completely interized and accepted the necture that the creativity and art , the end of the art , it will be some way to the end , it will always be in some way of the angoes .
And the question that I want to bring all the question today is : you are according with this idea ?
You know , it 's good . It 's a centimeter of a deal , I 'm not good for anything that supposed to me .
I think it 's odiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodd .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the lost century .
I think it 's better incorate our big creative minds to live .
And I 'm sure that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start figure out of the supposition of the supposition of the supposition that I 'm in my carrier .
It 's true -- I 'm looking at , I 'm young , I 'm young , I 've been about 40 years .
I 've got about four decades work in me .
And it 's very likely that whatever I 'm going to be right now in the world as the work that used to be judly after my last book .
I 'm going to go to the way , because we 're all more friends here -- is likely that my biggest succeeded to the mies .
Oh , Gesus , who thought .
You know that 's the genious thinking that bring a person to start to the ball of the person to start in the morning and I don 't want to do that .
I would keep keep going to do this work that we do .
So , the question become , how to do it , how do it ?
And so it looks like , after many riflexions , which the way to keep the way to write is to write is to create a psychological psychological protect , right ?
I had some way to find a security of sure that I 'm write , and my natural anxior natural anxior natural anxior , and my natural anxim , as I was trying to look at the time , and I was looking at the time , trying to see other society and see if I could have the most of the ideas and see if I could have more seances .
As people create people believe the inerent inerent people to be the risks of creativity .
And that search me taking me to the old Great Rome .
Seguitem because it was in certain and then back .
In the antician Great Rome and antician , people don 't seem creative creative creativity came to the creative of men , OK ?
It was thinking about it was that the creativity was this spirit , and that came from a few people from a some kind of a source distant , for reasons and sought , for reasons and connected .
The creativity called these days spirits us of creativity , " demons . "
Sock , wonderful , wonderful , created to have a demon the sagged by-land-away .
Romans were the same idea , but called that species of the kind of spirit .
which is great , because the Romans , because Romans not really , a genius was somebody particularly intelligent .
They had to be a genius that a kind of devine death that 's living in the muri study of a study , a little bit like the elfo , a little like the elfo Dobby , and that came out out of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of that work .
It 's extent -- that 's the distance of which is the psychological psychological that you proteging the result of your work .
And all of the known that was so that it was so , right ?
So , the articles were protects from certain things , as the too narcism , no ?
If your work was excited , it was not able to take all the way , all of course , all of the way they had been helped by this genius .
If your work fallide , it was not all the bad , right ?
All of all the known that was your genius to be a .
And so people han concept the creative creative creativity in Occident for a long time .
Then Rinascient came and everything , and it 's changed , and we put this big idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe , and I without more leaves and without more leaving space to create the deatures that they write from the divinity .
This was the mainly the major of human rational and people started thinking that creativity came to completely completely by shares .
And for the first time in history , you know , it 's going to this or that artist as a piece of genius , like a piece of genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big error .
I think that I lost somebody , a simple person to be like a recipient as a cell as the source of all the mists , creative of all the misters of all the misters , creative introuble , creative to the fragile psychems .
It 's how to get to somebody to ingoal to somebody .
Deform and distores , the same ego and creates all these inestablists on lost .
And I think it was this pression to distrutter the artists in the past several artists .
And if that is true , and I think it 's true , and I think it 's the question , and now ?
Do we can do it different ?
Maybe you go back to a more antical compassion of human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human relationship between human
Or , maybe no .
Maybe we can 't cancell phone of the rational push of 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that sold would be laining scientific suspectimes on the nection of the nection , insom that they following their design .
You can 't convinced you all this thing .
But the question I would like to take is -- why no ?
Why is not that that the way ?
Because it 's more sense of any other thing that has ever heard to explain the exasperts of the process creative imprevebility of creative process .
A process that , as anybody who ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever , all of the fundamentally , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it 's not comporition .
And it 's made , it can sometimes seemate seems to be completely paranormal .
I did this meet recently with the extraordinary poetesis , who was 90 years , but he was a little bit of the life and said , but it was a little bit of life and said that during his infancient infancient in the winner , he was working on the winner , and he was working on the wind , in the winner of the swait was in the soul .
He said , he was like a fragorous trenor .
And he came up to her rocket to her from the painting .
It was going to be able , because he was tremendous under his player .
He had a soly thing to do that point and was , he words , " corring like a mathemath . "
And so it 's going to go home and come up from this poetry , and it would not have to have to be able to do a piece of card and a mathematical math , as the traphic , as the traphic , and it would pay it on the page .
Sometimes couldn 't be fastly , so correct and correct windle , and it was not able to get to home and the poetry was going to go through and the perhaps , and it would keep up through the lander , like she would keep , " like , a little bit . "
Then there were those times -- this piece , I 'm not going to get -- there were the moments in which was almost lost lost lost ?
So , he was going to the home and he was trying to the card and the poetry was going to the moving , and then he was a washed in the way , and then he said , that was like that , and then he was like that , and then he was like a hand the window .
He was the poeted poety from and the reput in his body and the wind and the turn to page .
And in these cases , the population is going to the perfect and intention the last word , but the last word on the last word .
So when I thought , I 'm going to hear -- it 's exactly equal process , is exactly the creative of my creative creative creative creative .
I 'm not all my creative creative creative -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a music , and my way to work is ; I can see me at the same orary of the same orary day and I 'm going to go and pass us .
But I even even even , in my head , I 've been against that thing , I 've been meet to be .
And I 've got a lot of you have a lot of you .
You know , even if the work and the ideas were ideas to be sitting me from a certain courselves , you can 't be lost .
What is this thing about it ?
And how we can relationship to exchange us in the way that we can 't allow us , but it 's pretty much , rather that you do san ?
So how I 'm about , the best example of the best contemporary contemporary , which I have the Waititself , which I 've been different years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of the life was the incarnation of the artist was the instrument of the artment of the artment of the ink , and we 're going to control these species of inside , so that we were interized .
But then I invected , he 's calculate , and a day as he was driving on a Los Angeles Angeles , changed everything for him .
It was going to go fast and all of a sent sent , this little framment of melodia , which is the inspiration , and it 's lots , and it 's lots , you know , it 's wonderful , and the welling , you know , it 's not as a hyourself , but it wasn 't as a .
It 's not a piece of card , it 's not a mathematical register .
So I started to feel this species of old this species , " I 'm going to lose , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'll be lost by this slexion this song .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of go in the panic , you stop .
I 'll put the whole process and further something completely new .
I 'm just going to be the cielo and said , " Scuses , you don 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" To seems that can write a song ?
If you really want to be existing , there 's a more opports when I can take me cture .
Some minds , you 're important to something else today .
You can go to disturbing Leonard . "
And his process was changed after this .
I don 't work , the work was still known as a always .
But the process , and the weight was re-handed , the genius was remained when the genius , the genius was going to do with the other problems and liberry to the way that they came back to where it was going to come back and mented .
but I well-this peculiar , wonderful bizar-collaboration between Tom and this thing , this thing and this is that allowed , and I was not Tom .
So how I feel that story I was going to change a little bit of the way I was working on and already me on a time .
This idea , I was going to writing , " Manogy , Prega , Ama , " and I said , " and cadd in one of the disperation that we 're working on something and we 're working on something and we can 't start thinking about something and we can 't start thinking about something and we 're going to think that the worst .
It 's not just bad , just the worst book , it 's the book book .
And I started thinking about this project .
But then I remember Tom , I talked about the air and we tried to the air and we tried to be .
So I got my face in the managed on the managed and direct my moving in the room .
And I said , " Sents , " Sents , " You know , what we know if this book not be brilliant not in my mind , not be interactly bad , no interactly bad , right ?
Because as I see I 'm going to see that I 've got , I don 't have more than that .
So if you want you to be better , you have to present you and make your part of .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know , I don 't know what it 's all .
I 'll tell you to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to do that I was recorded that I was recorded me to do my part of the world , " because -- the end is so , OK -- secos in the wild of Africa , I was so , OK , OK , and music that was so on the wasking that they were going to go on .
And they were magnific , because the balleras were professionistic and were great .
But every , it 's really , something happen , and one of these artists was actually transcent .
And I know what you know what you know , because I know you 've got all of , a certain point , a lost performance .
It was like the time you stop , and the ballery walking through a kind of a kind of a bad ballery , and not just doing anything about different from the sun , but it all the 1,000 you were all .
And in the improvement , not just as a human human .
But it 's happening from the windominated in the fuel of the divinity .
And when this is the time , you know , the people knew what was called the the " " " " Fime .
They know , they started to slate , and they started slaughting , Allah , Allah , Allah , God . "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note -- when More invasered the Spth , the More More , presered this habitude with their own changed in the south of the Sple , Allah , Allah , " Olah , " " Olay , " " Okle , " " Olay , " " Olah , " " " Olay , " " Olah , " " Olah , " " " " " " " Olah , " " " " Olah , "
In Span , when a artist did something that impossible and magic , " Allah , " Allah , " Allah , I was a magnific , I was a bad , I was a scorm .
And it 's great because we need .
But the problem is the next day , for the ballery , when you see the ballery , when you see that 's 11 of Martedries and discover it .
It 's just just a mortal with gran mortal ginoccurred , and maybe not will never be able to be assuch a bad .
And maybe no one cancer will be the name of God , and what do is that you have to do cover the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most pain to do a creative life .
But maybe it 's not to be so ancient if you can 't believe , you know , the most extraordinary expectitional , which is the most extraordinary of your being from you .
But you just think you 're just that you 're data in the prested ininimaginable of this squisly of your life that you have to get back to something that you have been going to something when you 're going to end .
And , you know , if we think that 's what we think about this way .
And so I started thinking about , and it 's really really as a lot as I had thought , for different months , I thought , I was publishing the book that I published , the period , I 'm going to get the text of my great succeful successful .
And what I have to keep me when I feel hair , I feel electroduce , not have no long-.
I 'm not going to choice . It 's just your work .
It 's a deal of wind you , any could be .
If your work is balling , balling .
If the divine , assugent assummer decide to leave some kind of wonderful wonderful , for a moment through your slands , then you know , " Os , " Os . "
Etriments , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you 're the same .
And " Ole ! "
I think it 's a teaching it .
" Our ! " You know , it 's just for a human love and header tal , and tal heads to be keep the keep keeping .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I 've been talking about some of these projects on the human genes , what can meaning and discovered new genes .
Now , we 're starting a new way , we started digitalize the biology and now now , we 're going to start digital in a digital moving , we 're both in a fashion .
We 've always been trying to bring big questions .
What is life ? " What is life ? " It 's something that many biological , I think they have tented to figure out of livels .
We tried different approposed , reduced to the third terms .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was going to go from the world analogical world of biology in the digital world .
Now , we asked us : We can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital digital ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the genome that can autorem in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome for creating one more small .
We 're able to eliminate a centinail of the several of the seful of the thing are here .
But when we take a eye to his maps , is relatively simple answer our .
I think that 's simple .
But when we 're all to eliminate all genes that we can eliminate , it 's very improbad that this can bring a living cells .
So , we decided that the only for progreening to provide that the only way to be a few modify modify , so that we have the only components to the dom of these things .
And so we started the " Posanize the " Posare we can be a cromosoma ? "
It 's the chemistry to produce these big molecules that we 've never been able to create before ?
And in case , in case , we can make a cromosom ?
A cromosom is just a piece of cheeemist .
The speed with which we 're able to digitalize life is growing exponential life is growing exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , instead , it 's a better , but it 's better .
And our most recent recent result to a trential exponential exponential exponential .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process process has required a lot of biothic review , we started with a biothic ree-experiments before we started experiments .
But we found that that synthetize the DNA is very difficult .
There are thousands of thousands of the world that producing little segment of DNA , the long , the long of the long 50 lectest , and it 's a degenerative process : the most herrors is a long , more errors .
So we had to develop a new metodo , we have to make these framments and correct these herrors .
And this was our first telling our first tape , to digital information , I 'll go to the digital genome .
It 's a little virus that killed batters .
We designed the framments , effectured the correction of the errors and I got a molecule of DNA , about 5,000 lectable leck .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemist , and we 've got it in the batters , the bacteria , the bacteria have started to read this code and we 've got to proach this genetic code .
The viral particles are re-leaved cell , they 're back back and they 're back and distrutter .
I talked about the recent of the oil industry , oil that they have certainly compress that they have certainly compress this model .
They remember more than you .
We think that this is a situation where the software can actually build his own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own own .
But we wanted to do things the bigger .
We had to build the whole cromosom of the battery .
I 'm more than 580 miles of code code .
So we thought we 've thought about the seven of the virus , so that we could change the seven of the virus , so that they are the components of a living cells .
The designing is crucial designers , and if we start information digital information , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accuratory was a herror for every 10 myself .
We found , recently , 30 erros , 30 errors . If we had been used to be able to be able to do that original work .
One part of the process is designed 50 lectelling 50 lectelling that they can suvestiors with all other segment of 50 lectable to build such summer than the little work together .
We 're going to be a only one .
You know , you know , you know , we put the floor .
Think about four , we have a genetic code on four lectiny , and Two , and Two .
Three of those lectiny together about 20 love , and there 's about 20 love , and there 's a specific order to the lectiny , there 's a specific order to each minod-minod-minod-minod-minod-minod-minod-minod-minod-minod-minod-minods , and there is a specifi
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frankly , you know , it 's almost , depensive .
What we did in the beginning was autography .
Some of course , they were in the fact that it was not poety .
We designed these segments for these segments to just just only one .
There are them that reparing them and put them them and put them .
And we started assembly to assemble parts , beginning with seven seven to five to seven mile , unending them in a way to be able to be able to be 72 miles to get 72 miles .
So , we 've made these sequencing these sequences in a little site , so you 're trying to create a little bit of creating the extremely robuts -- like you see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems to be the tabellone player .
When we get these segments very long , more than 100 mile , more than 100 miles , they 're not growing up in Ecoli .
It 's going to the limits of the modern modern modern molecular modern .
So we 've been considered other monected .
We had another mecusual mechanism called recombination omologic , which is actually use in biology to do the DNA , you can make DNA segment to slow segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus , it can assorry , it can assues three million radiation .
You can see in the requare the sudperior as his cromosoma gap .
In 12 , 24 hours is exactly like it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can secate completely .
They can live under vacuum .
I 'm absolutely sure that life in space , and you can find new environments in space , and you can find new environments of water .
It 's true , NASA has shown that this is .
This is a molecule of molecule that we 've built these processes , just using these processes with design appropriate with design appropriate .
The lived them assemble them to the automatically .
This image was not choiced with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a lot of a lot of a very big microscope that we can see with a microscope .
These are picture that they 're cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publilication that we did a few time ago .
I 'm more than 580,000 lectiny code .
It 's the molecule , the largest molecule of a deal .
It 's a lot of a lot of sudddenly suddperior .
If we 're going to stop with a 10 without spaces , there would like 142 page , they would like 142 page this code .
Now , how do we do it ? How do we do it ?
Of course , you know , a virus is a game from girl .
It 's a little bit more complicated when they use the batters .
It 's simple as simple when it 's cell ekariote the ekariote the nucleo and inserious inserne , and it 's basically the process of clonation .
In the bacteria battery , the battery is instead of the cells , but we recently have recently demonstrate that we 're able to do a trant trant trapiece of a cell .
We had a cromosom with a species .
The two are different as the men from the tops .
We add some gene in the most way that I could choose to be able to decide that the cromosoma .
The sciolden sciols , so that I kill all the protein .
And when we put it in the cells was stupend -- and apprecise our grapprecise , we 've got our grapprecient , the new cell .
And we thought we were not going to go through , but we 've tried to be in the lander .
This is one of the most monectures .
We found that a lot of a third , a third or a third of a third , adgend , advines a thousands of new trats .
So who think about the evolution as a only gene , as a gene at the time that 's modic of biology .
There 's the expensive thing called me restriputes that adtells the digerism .
The cromosom that was in the celell .
The cell phula-cromosom that we have inserious .
It 's expressed , and it has recognized the other cromosoma as a material , the masticate , and we 're reported with only the new cell .
It 's blue blue because of the genes that we 've got inserious .
And in a short leave you , all the career of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a new software , based on the new software that we 've inside in the cells .
All the proteins are changed , the membraning , and when we law the genetic code , and when we 're going to be travel .
Now , this could seem alcheemy genetic , but it 's software , but it 's software , we can change the DNA , we can change the software enough sustainable .
Now , I 've been explained that here , but I have a progress on this digital project to get three million years and a half of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of this process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's enough obvious when we think about our needs .
We 're going to go from six billions and half billions in the next 40 years .
Right for example , I was born in 1946 .
Now there 's three people on the planet for each other , in 1946 , in 40 years , there will be four .
We 're going to find problems now to find food , water , water , water and balance , medicine and benefits , and a half a half billions and a half a half billions and a half a half billion people .
It 's going to be more than doing this nove for news .
We 're more than five billion , more than 30 billion , more than 30 billion billions of the olium .
That means that it means a million baries at day .
When we 're trying to find biological processes , or whatever kinds of process to remainted them , it will be a huge huge challenge .
We have to keep the most tension of CO2 from these materials that finishing these materials that finishes in the atmosphere .
Al day , I 'm going to discoveries in all the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are the components for the future .
The electronic industriy , it just a dozen about components , and you think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limits here is the major biological imagination , and our imagination .
Now , we have techniques , thank these metods of these metods of the techniques , we call genomics genomics .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million cromosomes at day .
Think of the processing these 20 million genes or different ways of these are different processing , and they can be able to provide , new vaccines , new vaccines , we can change , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology .
And it 's just a standard standard .
We can choose to be able to be survive , it 's cheemistry , production of the vaccines , production of vaccines .
This is an istant instantanizing some software programmed to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to to be able to be able to be able to
Well , we don 't know what they will be going to be .
We know exactly true is their genetic code .
Now we 're going to be such the coal of quarter .
You also saw you who have been an extremely landed experiment was a finite finished .
We have carbon second second second and third generation that are used enough to get zoooh cost of the most value , or different kinds of butanothers .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact with the cost of the food and limited food and limited the cost of food and limited the disponing CO2 , we 're working on the CO2 , we 're working on the major that we 're working on the major reaching that can be able to do this discovered in the first generation of how to be able to be able to be able to be in the first generation in about 18 months .
The sun light fall with CO2 is a metodom -- but in our discoveries in our discoveries , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we have described in 1996 .
It 's going to the ocean profound , about 2500 feet of the temperature of ebullition of the water .
They 're going to put the CO2 , we 're going to hydrogen molecular energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can incannot be transported by CO2 , that can be be transported by the CO2 , to drive this process .
So , we 're going to be able to be able to car what the question of the question of the question of the base that the question of the base is Noil , we have the truth .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where you can 't do it ?
It would be a main the background .
Almost , we 're working for using the same metods to create vaccines .
You 've seen this year with influence , we 're always back to a year and with a dollar in less , and with a dollar in less .
I think what you can change this is going to be able to be able to fight fighting in antician .
That 's how the future could start seem to be changing , the high of evolution , acceping the evolution of evolution , acceping the evolution of the bacteria , and then finally inside , infinally , inally inside , and then finally , you end up the future of the evolution of the future .
We 're so so on the best people .
Our discover is to be able to live enough to be able to be able to be able to do .
I 'll give you all the most rapidly possible , a little bit of the fundamental work , some fundamental technology that we took the Microsoft in the following Microsoft in a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a true environment that you can interact with a local huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing molecures gaxytells with a species of photos and keeps , and continue , for a fast , for a fast , disponing the images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big amount of information that we see , how big these are big guys or the data .
Most of the photographs are digital photographs , but this for example is a proach from the Biiiiiiiist of Congress , and it 's in the gamapixel .
It 's not a difference because the only thing that 's limits prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any moment . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not .
This is the Casa desoled Dickens . Everyday coloned .
For show you that it 's just about the text and not images , we can 't do something about this , to see that it 's really a real representation of a representation of the text , not a picture of the test , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a book to read a book .
It 's not about it .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the Wardian .
Everybody imagine is the beginning of a section .
And it 's going to be the floor and the beautiful experience of the version of a revision or a quotidian extactly revist , which is a molecular plice .
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of the The Guardian .
We created a fasules a fasules solutionary solutionary , much more than that you use in a normal published , and we 've got inside the content .
If you want to see the careful catternership , you can see here .
Or other model , or even specific model , I 'm specific .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We 're going to be able to put up the end of the pop-up and other porcheries , not have to be necessary .
And in the map is one of the most obvious applications of this kind of technology .
And on this is not lose you , if we don 't know , if we have contributed to this field .
These are all the streets in the USA , the USA , you know , a geospacal picture of NASA .
So we 're going to be something else .
This is actually actually actually , this is actually been the web ; you can go to .
It 's a project called Photosynthrown , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other search is a visual search for Noah Snavah Snavah Snavity , a student of Washington , with Steve Seitz Steve Steve Steve Seitz Steve .
And it 's from Seadragon the web , gested by Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from another and have this kind of extent resolution to the other experiment resolution .
But the space space is spactive of the space has effectively a meaning meaning .
Galgorites of visualization , the computer registrated these images together , in the way that corresponding to the obhrements in which is the image of the Montaghi , you can see the slaghi , you see the Montaghi , you see the souches . So , you see the elements of the soul , these things are are all the sort-de-. So , these things are all the fall-deal .
I don 't know if I 've got a few other environment .
There are some very more space space .
I want to go to one of the Noahy-data -- and this is this prototype of Notosynththrototype of Photosynthrote that we did work for the first time , to show you what the first time is really clear . And it 's not necessarily asked the technology . And it 's not necessarily looking at the website . And it 's not necessarily looking at the web .
We had to worry about the ladies and saying .
This is a rebuild the Notre catthedral . I 've got a Flickr . Baast digitate digitate Notre Dame . And you get this is a types of the field , other wind , other wait is saying . You can be a picture that you can 't discovered .
So , they 're all images from Flickr and they 're all lights in this way .
And it 's possible to go to this way , just that 's just just going to just ism .
You know , I would never have thought to do it for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying this kind of accover here .
I think that you can see that that it 's a lot of different different kinds of different kinds of different foolds of phones , the physical phone , which was a number of SLR , a number of meaning , had a number of them together .
And if you 're going to be able to try to look at those more strange .
Many of them are block , etc .
And somewhere here is a series of photographs -- that 's a series of photographs .
This is a poster of Notre Dame .
We can go from the poster the vision of this environment .
The point is extent is that we can do things with social environment . This is now ready ready ready the social intermemory , from the whole memory , from the vision of visual visual vision , and they all all those data together .
All those photographs , most of the som of the parts .
You have a whole model of the land that emerging .
Think about this as a surbunging work of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity , and the people do use it , and the people who vantages to the car people who are using the car .
They have a married photographs are all of other people .
If somebody comes the idea of the idea of the idea of these saying , my photograph , my picture of Notre Dame , I 'm going to be able to get all these data , and the can use of all the data , and the can use of the way to be a soubed in the universe , using the photographing , using the universe , and have a craft , and have a cle-mo-mo-mo-momos-momom .
And in fact , a consecence of all this is model , extremely elaborated elaborated , I 'm not just as a view of the terms of the terms , but from the memory and similar satellar , but from memory .
Mille .
Chris Anderson : I understand that ? What your software in the next software going to do is that a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs , all the photographs will be across . How do you have a lot of across the whole world ?
BA : Yes . What 's what it 's doing in the cover is discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , you , you know , between the picture .
And it 's doing it in the base of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting , if you think about the recogness of information security that many of these images that many of these images .
How do you make a search of the web , you digit , you digit , you digit on the web , a lot of information about the web of the picture .
Now , what happens if that photographs all the photographs ?
So the amount of interconnection and the quantity of the semantical recognize that we have to have a huge . It 's a huge classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible . It 's incredible .
BA : You 're very three-f-scale .
One of the main piaces when you travel and one of the research of the research chetnographics is the power of the power of the anti-traditions , which is the past in the wind , the wind of the floor , the wind of the floor floor .
Basti think that sciamani Jaguar viavel , and the VLattea , or that the mites of the Inuit , or the Inuit 's still colors , or in Himalaya , the good way they can 't do the respair , to remember the most important thing that the idea that the idea that the world 's idea that the idea that the idea that the world 's idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that the idea that we live in the idea that the idea that the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the idea of the world ,
the consequence of a particular scape that our stroping is our strops , well , a lot of generations ago .
And of course , we all share , we all share .
All we all all . All we do .
We are suggests to the beginning .
We need to fall the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprising and ballide , we don 't surprising and ballide --
We all have a art .
What it 's the rate is the rthm of the song , the ritm of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they 're the inindom of the Borneo , or the following Voooodoo , or the window , or the wind Kenyssh , Curt , Curt , or a wap of the Sahara .
He was my bad burn journey in the desert of the witch , or a high of the cyak , the Everest , the Everest mother , the mother of the world .
All these populations teachers are teaching there are other ways of these other ways of the moving people , other ways of music in the world .
And if you reflected a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
Insian , the myriathy of cultures of the world creating ragela of life spiritual and cultural cultual well-being as the planet and it 's important to be the planet as the ragela .
And you can think about this ragela cultural etnosis , and you can call the etnossis , you can call the som of all the conception of all the conception , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions in the human consciousness .
The nesthetnosis the patrimonium .
It 's the symboll of what we are and what we can be in how much species .
And it 's the biosphere was free consumed , it 's going to the etnossh , and purther much much more rapidly .
Noogist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species was about the orear of the extinction of the extinction , or the most apose -- in the ipose , in the sun of biological -- and you don 't have close to the pop of the points -- that 's the most most oxist of the points -- that diversity of the secity .
The indict of all , obviously , the loss of language .
When you 're bored 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only only only only only only only one gaaaaabulary rulation .
A language is the spirit of the human spirit .
It 's the midddle of every culture is the animal of every culture of the world .
Every language , a long-mind , a model , a mind , a thought , a chance of possibility .
And those 6,000 languages , as we 're sedutes in Monterey , alleast half is not more suddenly surroyed in the orecchie of children .
They 're not more teached children , the children that means , at least that you don 't won something , which are already die .
What is there more trils of the site , the last silention , the last site , the last to talk about a language , not the way of the wisn of the aves of the par of the children ?
This orring was a fashion some of some of the world every two weeks , every two weeks , every two weeks , a moon the tomber , and the door , the ulsyllabe of the ulsyllabe .
And I know somebody who 's going to say , " Don 't it ?
The world would be a better place if we 're all the same language ? " Benism , then we talk about all yorba . We talk about saying , we talk about saying .
We talk about kogs .
You 'll cover a tract thing to say , not to be able to talk about their language .
I 'd like to do a journey through the etnosmoththnossmothththnossmoke --
a little journey in the etnosite of what we 're lost .
Many of us dimented that when I say , " different ways of exist existing exist .
We take for example , this bimber Barasana , in Amazony , the popular of the anacony , which credeal of the west west west , which creds to the figure out of the sacet .
It 's a popular popular , it 's not able to distinguy the blue is because the truth is identified in the forest time , from the forest time , which dependent popular .
They have a strange language and a monial mathematrimonial , " examia language , " You can sent a different person who 's a different language .
All this is radical in the past , yet the particularity is that in these families that in these families that are talking about six or seven or seven , or seven , no one language .
They 're limited to listening and then they start talking about .
We take one of the tribe more interesting with the Waoran , the Waoran Ecuador Waoran Ecuador incredible popular , a incredible that had the prime in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionary , they 've tented a fun in the error .
They did choice , they had been showing them that they were reports in a few people who reports them , dimenting that this popular pluvial projuvide had never seen any whose whose whose sional .
They 've got to tell the photographs , they have been doing a shape or a floor , and not found nothing , they 're going to be introduced by the dience , and they killed five missionary , and they killed the five five missionary .
But Waorani not only killed the straniesteresterday .
They killed between them .
And 54 percent of the mortality was caused by their own .
We 've got a generations of the generations , and we found two of moral death , and when we 've got to know , they have a lot of them , they have been ined by the same . They 've got the same .
The crap were able to recognize the urina animal from 40 pass and recognize the species .
In the first 1980 , I had been asked a very interesting companor my professor of Haiti , I asked me a wonderful way I wanted to go to Haiti in the Seconomer , the base of the power of Duvard . And I can sledraw me to do the wind Macoutes , and impossleep to do the zoms .
So , I would have to buy a mirazy , I would have to understand the Voodoor is not magnine .
It 's rather than a complex vision , and it 's a complex measure .
So , what 's interesting .
If I asked you to tell me great religions of the world , what do you do ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
An continent is always leave out that Africa , thinking about Africa is not a religious . And instead of religious religious . And the Vooodoo is not the distillate of these religious concepts of these concepts .
What makes interesting voodoor is the wind is the intense is the intense of life and dead .
So , you live in the spirits .
The spirits can be instead of the Aqua , they said , " There are the ritm of the dance and they replaced in the site of the vision of the vision of the vision of the vision of the way that you have become the cover .
So , the voodoists , they 're going to say , " You can go to God .
We 're going to say , " I 'm going to be God . "
And from the moment that you 're going to be able , you know , how you can do you , how you can do you do the mal ?
So you 're going to these incredible events : following voodoor in state of the body had touch a piece of infuel infuel infuel infuel infuel ined a state of the body when it 's a catalization .
It was all the populations with the most extraordinary populations are the Kogi Sight-Sight-Santa Marta , in Colombia , in Colombia .
It 's going to be civilization , the tirance had a living on the planure of Colombia in the piece of the conquistic , the popular wind , the popular wind , the population was going to the player .
In a drug , this popular , this popular , this popular was not conquisted by spages .
It 's a moved by a cler , but their formation is the extraordinary extraordinary .
The young following from the family , they 're going to three or four years , and live secreated secreated in a bad world made of base in the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base in the base of the base of the base in the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the base of the b
Two draw years of the weless of the nine of the nine months of gestation that transrate the mother , now are metaphor , now they 're in the murther of the Great Mother .
So , this time , they 're accultural values of their society , value that their preghting and only their preghting their preghting and only their preghting the equilier .
At termine of this incredible beginning , they 're improved by the first time in life , in their life , in the age of 18 years , you see a high . And in that the moment of the first thing , when the sun , the sun of the first cutes , everything that have learned in the sun . And the first time , that they 've learned in the midd-fer , the first time in its spend . The free free . The free free .
" I said , " Do you like you .
It 's study . Now , it 's to you . "
They call them frateles and they say that we , fratels , we 're the collies of destruction of the world .
This is extremely important intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the ingene and injudge , we think that these populations are the site story of the noble became , which is a concept in his simplicity or magine , we 're going to be close to the Earth .
The ingenes are not not sentimental nained nia .
There is no space for these things in the palures of disease , or the gelids of the Tibet , but thank you very much time and the riti , they created a mistics of the Earth . And you 've created a mystics of the war , but it 's going to a bection , the concept that the Earth can only live in the site , the concept that it can only only only only only only only only only only only only only only only only only because it 's the concept that the War that the War the War can only have to be able to be that 's the War that 's the sell to be a realized zed zed zed by the site that 's going to be a bad to the
What does that mean ?
I mean a guize that a girl , that a Ande of Anyde , the mountain is a spirit of the Apu that 's going to be a human destine , it will be a human project . It 's going to be a very different realize with the mountain . And it 's a very slightly different that a guizing mountain that a worth of Montana .
That 's the dimitself , or a mineral ball .
What 's interesting is the metaphor is the metaphor is the individual of the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of Columbia creding that the forests forests serve to be wrong .
And I realized a human being in my friends Kwakiutl that credate forests are creating the forest of Hukukuk and the stories of the paradic stories that live in the extreme of the world , explained that we live in the extreme that we 're going to the Hamats .
If you start to think that these cultures can actually create different , you could actually start to understand some of their discoveries . We make some of the pational sensationship .
I 've been scaced this picture in Amazony nornorthemselves .
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayahuask , the most powerful sustained the scianic scianic check .
What makes the plant is a little bit of the ayahuashic , but his elaboration is not the power of sustained , but his elaboration . It 's composed .
He 's a landed , this lian until that containly a series of co-carboline , harmful , lah , read you can 't be killed .
It 's the solar solar the solar blue that alters a little bit of the comic , but it 's miscreen , but it 's miscreen with the beyond of the causing a family called Psychotrid-redy-redrid-red-red-fid-fid-fid-fid-fid-fid-fid-fid-fidd .
This one plant contains that soubtamine , very similar , very similar , demethoxial , methoxytaminy .
If you ever see Yanomi , you ever see the Yanomi , they do with a different kind of a different kind of a different kind of a different kind of a different kind of methoxylyptams .
Tirate that polar the nass is a little bit like being spared by a fire saved figure out of a depints of electricity .
I had often often , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who waiting the man was psycheel , with his discovered , with his discovered in the ' 30 in the ' 30 in the ' 30 in the ' 30 in the ' 30 years .
I 'm my tinese , you can 't get these triptiny , you can 't tell these triptiny because you 're not tells no one of being killed .
It 's possible to be assummming , if you 're going to other summming money money money money .
Now , the beautiful : the beautiful : the beautiful : the MAO , the MAO , the same kind of the MAO , the same kind of the soubs . The question is that soubt . The question is that you can find two of two pic pic pic piece of pes , but if you can 't find two , that if you can 't fight a soul that it 's a way that if you can do a sumer that if you have a summmmmmmmmmer ?
We use the great eusual eusual eusual prove , that can refly infruttifer .
But if you ask the Indian Indian , they 'll tell us , " The plant plant talk about . "
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuasks , which distinced our eyes , and that our eyes would be in the forests , and that our eyes would be in the same species .
If you ask them , you know , how they 're going to be , " No , I thought I was going to understand the rest of the rest , I didn 't know all the rest ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night of land-sent . And each other , and obnice , and obnice .
And that 's not slaurea Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that content the stami .
Now , [ [ the problem is that those of us who have heard of us who have heard of us , they 're ingenes are the pitting pitting the pitting of the story of the story of the story of the story , and it 's pass .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it 's not going to be remember for his drive or innovations , but rather as the was that we 're stmed in the world that we 're standmed by accepted , and we have bad bad modly or cultural vaced by the problem . Now , the problem is not change .
All cultures through the secos have been involved in a switch for new possibility of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indian Sioux , they didn 't stop to be Sioux when they put out of the ark and frectly as American being American being American being American being American being horse when they put out .
It 's not the technology that the technology that minaccount the integrity of the etnosis . It 's the power .
The domination of domination .
And if you 're about the world , you know that these are not cultures that these are not cultures in the world , you know , you know ,
They 're creatures and dynamics and dynamics from the existence existence from the forces will be able to adaptation .
And that 's the tratric of the patria of the patria of the ink of the ink .
a popular Sarawak , in the Sarawak , a popular , a popular who lived in the forestimate , and we 'll go to a generation , and now re-do--forested , and we 'll go to the prostitution on the reflection of the refined Boriiiiiizing the midd-west measure of Minese , where the Cinese navorest , where the Minese Cinese swest ,
You take the wood to get the wood , I 'm going to the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are coming with the discovery of the gold .
If we 're going to be on the mountains of the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of search of political .
As you know the genocide , the physical extinction of a popular , but the thnocise , the destruction of the style , the destruction of a popular life , not only is condition , but the destruction of the world , because it 's part of the development , because it 's part of the development of the development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet , until you can 't be part from the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China , the Tibet in China through Tibet , the Tibet , came to Lhasa , and then just came to Lhasa , but only came to Lhasa , I just came to Lhasa , I just get the statistics of the statistics .
6,000 monuments sacred sacred in polling and cenlights in polling and cenlights .
1.2 million people killed the Cultural Rivolution .
The purn of this guy was ascritical to Panchen Lama .
which means that it 's been killed to the tempts of the Chinese Inasion .
I had a flost with Santity , the Santity , the deah , the deah in Nepal .
It was a mother was fashion and his colpa was remember .
It was taken by the nasked in a career in the age of two years old , he would not have been able to live without him .
The surprising , which has done it was moved in camp .
It was a day , he was a calculate fashion Mao and , for this transgression , was mession , was mespecially , was mespecially , it was mesis , moved the works .
The Tibet can be insopportable , but it spirit , it 's the inside of the popular popular is .
All the end , all of it , all the scale .
We want to live in the world world 's monoy or we want to get the world the policicromatical world ?
The big anthropologa Mead , before he die said , his bigger was that , in our bigger was that , in our moving in the world , not just see the whole gamorem of human imagination , we 'll see the intergamorous of human imagination was that , but a day we can see that there was a sone-moon the son-wake , but it was a day , we 'll be able that there was a few other way that they were others in the other way .
And it 's ubility that our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Neolitical Rivolution , which has given us the agriculture , which has made us surprising the population of the ses of the site of the site of the site , creating the gerarchy of the sler , creating the specialization of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
Smodern world industrialized has been 300 years .
That 's any story about history not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenge of the challenge of the figure out of the figure out .
When these myriathy of cultures of the world is asked what they want to be humans , respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these risis that we all risis that we all risis , that we 're going to be what we are : a kind of a kind of hyours , which is all the people are all the gares of the challenge . And there are great moments of horing .
I 've been shown this picture on the northern northern the northy of the Baffin , when I went to the balking the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , and this man , he tells my mother .
The government is not always been gone , the government , and in the 1950 to stuck our summatia , we have rink , we have rink them in colonies .
The grand-furned to go to go .
The family , teming , I 'm going to his life , and all the arms , and all of his attends .
You know that the Inuit doesn 't text the Inuit .
The paces of the slites were made in the sleep in the purching pitself .
And the granding of this man , you don 't fall from the night , or from the published that soffied .
It 's saving , it 's calculate , it 's calculate pant in the pantales and defected in the behind . When you get the hand , they 've got the creating creating a lama .
It 's sprended to the points of this colleags and when they solid , and when they solid , he killed a cane .
He waves the dog , and created a bunch , with the cases , with the hyourself , he had a little bit of the sliterally , and it 's bleap on the ball .
We want to talk about the cavared with anything ? [ [ Risn . And this , in different ways ways , [ Applausi is the symbl of the world .
In the U.S. The government canadese government has reached the Inuit , the total area of the total area of the largest California and the Texas .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavails .
It 's a territoral territorary . We know all all the resources of the requipment .
One splendied , for example of how a natione-instance , can recognition with his popular .
And I finally , I think it 's pretty obvious , I think it 's not in these zremote zone of us , it makes that they 're not affected that are not further .
For somebody is home .
They appearing of human imagination , humans that risis in the high of the time . And we all of these children , like the dreams of these children , they become part of the hope , they become part of the hope .
For the finally , we have a National Geographic , we 've got the political political political will never get to none .
We think the polemiics --
[ Applausi , they 're not lost , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Ogams of the world . Ogams our site .
156 countries transmed our television television .
Our revided our lives from millions of people .
Our work is travel in the public work to bring our audience in places of wonderful cultural change from the world , they 're hoping , you hope , you can 't get to the way , you hope , you can 't have to find a long time for the world . It 's existing existing in a different pluralists in a world . And we have to find one of the world .
which is all the saggeness of all the populations can be connected to our well-being collied .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I 've been written in this book that hope you 've heard and I 'm going to be able to be able to be able to be some of the college .
I 'd like to start with what I call the dogen coufficial .
The dogen dogen ?
The dogen dogen coufficial , the dogen eye , the dogen coufficial citial citizens : " If we want to massive citizens the way . " The way to do is massive liberty . "
The reason is , from a late , in the fact that the liberty is in the same way , it 's precious , it 's expensive , essential , essential , essential , essential humans .
Another is in the fact that if we are libes , each of us can act for all of us to do everything that massive massive massive , without any one that decided in our well-being , without any one that decided in our name .
The way for massive to massive liberty is massive to choice .
Maybe choice , the people have , more liberty , and most liberty is their liberty , most liberty is their benefits .
This , that 's so foundly refoundly , that nobody would have any of metters that nobody would have to put it in the bbio .
And it 's also deeply readiced in our lives .
I 'll show you some examples of what the progress has to be able .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly great .
I 'm going to get a simple note injumped .
In my supermarket , there 's 175 conditions , without content 10 variety of the extract 10 variety of the coolily , 12 acetes that you can buy a number of conditions in the including of the pattern in the pattern in the pattern in the pattern .
That 's the supermarket .
Then you went to the electronic negotic to buy a stereo : cases , a few , lector , radio , radio , the lefer .
And in this single electronic negotic , there 's a big number of components .
We can make six million and half million different fighting the components that there are in a only goice .
You can have a lot of admit , there 's very choice .
Altri fields : the world communications .
As , when I was a child , they could get all the serious telephone , the telephone , the path that were moved by mamazing Bell .
It was gained the telephone , they didn 't buy .
An a consecence of that , it was that the telephone had never been .
These tempts of the time were went .
Now , we have a variety of phone , especially between phone , especially between phone .
Here 's the future .
My favorite is the midddle , lector MP3 , and forth of the naso , and forth in the bad .
If you don 't have seen it in the negotic in the home , you 're going to take it .
And what the end of the end is that people in the negogozes and it 's the answer . And you know what the answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that is not easy .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the same exhibition , is the same exhibition of choice .
Assistency : it 's not going to the United States that you can 't happen in the United States , and the doctor , what you have to do .
So , I 'm going to go from doctor , and the doctor , we could do . As , we could do . As a " A : " A " A " A " A " Boy , " " A " Boy , these risks . What do you want ? "
You say , " Dottore , what do I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , and these risks , and these risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you can be able to be , " Dottore if she was me , what would do ? "
And the doctor : But I 'm not . "
The result the result , we call it " autonomy disease , expression that it looks like a beautiful thing .
But it 's not that one is that a south and responsibility to somebody who know something , you know , you know , that 's the doctor , somebody else , whatever you know , it 's not a very very much -- and so it 's not in the condition for the patient patient .
There is a huge marketing products , the drugs , they direct people like me and you , that if you think it 's not a sense , because you can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them them , why do they do them ?
The answer is that they want to doctor for the doctor for asking them to change the remember .
What the fundamental thing is our identity , is our identity , as you can see in this visual vignize , like you can 't want to force children . They 're going to get children . " We don 't want to get a more than than initive .
And we can inventing how many times us aggraps us .
which means that every morning , at the answer , you have to the guy , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
I read the family and the family and matrimonium , a time , a common time , until it was that you can be able to be able , and he started to faller the most than you can .
The only only only truth was with who , not when you 're doing it , and not less what to do after .
And it 's worse , all of it is really to play .
I teach students very intelligent , and I do their 20 percent in less work .
And it 's not because they 're less less than not because they are less diligent .
but why are they impensieritites , I 'm going to ask , " I would like to slow me or not ? " I would do that right now ? "
" Do I would like to be able to be able ? I thought before you the career ? "
I 'm interrogorant .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this implessy , even if this implesson and not get a beautiful vote and not get a beautiful vote .
And they have to do it . They 're really important .
Now , the work : We 're lucky , like Carl sound , because technology technology lost us to work every minute , every day , every every day , every every angle of the planet , in the Hotel Randolph .
Twra , there 's a corner , and I 'm not going to tell any , where WiFi works .
I 'm not going to say , because I want to use it .
What means , this is that this amazing liberty to choice that we have to work ? It 's going to work ? It 's going to be a way , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son , you can go to the cell phone , with the Blackberry , the Blackberry , the Blackberry , the gineye , the gineye .
And even though they 're all spent , every minute that we see our son , we 're also asking us , we 're also asking , " Do I had to say , " Do I had to say , " Do I have to say , " Do I had to say , " Do I had to be able to be able to be able to this called ? "
" I had to answer this email ? I had to get this letter ? "
And when the answer is " no , all this makes the experience of your child , very different than the exactly , very different from the other conditions .
So , from any part of any part of it , things , and big , objects and big material , life is a question of life , life is a choice .
As the world was this : Ovue , there was some possibility , but not all the chance of choice .
The world today is such a lot of this : The dilemma is , " It 's a positive , or negative ? "
The answer is South .
The positions of the slights , so I 'm going to talk about those negative .
All this choice , two effects two effects in the people .
The first first , paradoxed , is that it produces instead of liberation .
With the tant options that choose choose choose choose to do .
I offer a meaning example : a further , a sui condot of the fly depensive further .
A colleaged my colleaged to the data of the Vanks , the young society of the function of the words of the works of the works of the works .
What she found was that it is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adesion the lower .
With 50 percent of offered , there 's 10 percent adesions , there 's only five percent of adesian is only five ?
Because with 50 of the floor , it 's maleds , is maledited , and the choice is to decide , and the choice is remainly .
And I 'm asked , and I 'm asked , questions , and of course , and of course , I 'm going to be able to be .
You know that it 's not just that these work from the old old old old old food for canses , because they 're not sold enough money , they want to say that the decision is so ostic , they will be lost the decision is so ostic the decision is so hard that they lost the decision is so ostic .
It 's not talking about it , they 're lost to five dollars for the dator of work , that would be be bad , that would be be bad .
So the paralysis a consecence of the having .
And I think that makes the world .
" And " I finish , the eternity : ketcheet , senape or maionth ? "
You 're going to take the right decision , if it 's the right , it 's true , right ?
You don 't want to choose the source , and you can 't want to choose the source .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can get the paralized paralysis , and make a sceless , at the end of the result , we 're not going to be able with less options .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with the tants of these is that wake , if you buy , you know , and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to do a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that happens is that happening is that the alternative imagine that is the horders of choice , and the remainted windoor , the south , the sleep ,
when it was a good decision .
More : there 's more easy , more easy , more easy of any drive than the option of the option .
Also , there is what economist-opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has asked very good stamatine as the value that we see the things that we think about the things with the things .
At the rest , when there are many options , it 's easy , it 's easy to be able to be less substent scared by and be less soddiscovered .
Here 's an example . I 've all those who are not New York .
But it 's what you probably think about it .
There 's this cople to Hamptons .
It 's a luser place .
It 's floor . Otten drawind . It 's all for them .
It 's not a good . But what he think about it is , " Well , disease , it 's Agogoc . "
" All my neighborhood . "
" I would like to talk about front of you in front . "
And he pass two weeks , the idea that 's going to be lost -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants to .
The opportunity is deminumines the suddddisfation for what we have , even when the choice was old .
And the most of the options that we have to be able , more the careful characteristic characteristic .
Here 's another example .
This vision says us a lot of things .
It 's going to live the moment , and maybe live lently .
But the most important point is that any thing you choice , you can choose , you can won 't do other .
The things that we don 't choose to be able to be able to make less active what we do .
Terzo , it 's expensive growing expectative expensive .
I 've tried on my pattern beyond a new couple of jeans .
It 's almost always jeans .
As the jeans were a only kind of a , they bought them and vestivestivestivestily , they were just later , just after they started a life and work a bad .
So , I went to buy a couple when the old old old old , and I said , " I 'm going to go , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my wrong . "
And the common said , " Li want to slim , easy , hesxed , relaxed fit ? "
Who wants with the bunch , or with the bottons ? " Stonewashed " or " " " " " " "
" Who wants to striced ? "
" Sott them want to be a ball of the bla -- " Continured , " Continured it .
I was sbalort , and after a little bit , and after a little bit of the kind of , " I want the kind of the only kind of the only kind of the only kind of jeans , then you all have been used to be able to be able to jeans , then used the negotic jeans , with the best painting , with the best jeans , with the best jeans that I 've ever had never had .
It was the massive massive . And all the choice had been doing the better .
But I feel worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book for understand it .
The reason I was going to be a worse is that with all the choice was althight , jeans had to be perfected .
I had waaait . I was going to be a minime . I didn 't expected anything excited when there was a kind of 100 different , you 're going to be perfect .
What I had a good , but I didn 't perfect .
I open to wagoned that I was trying to the choice with what I was insoddisorder to expectative .
The add of the options of the life does not that cell expection that these have respond to the ective phence that these have respond to the ection of the same .
And this will be less sodriven , even when the result , even when the result .
Nobody in the world marketing in the marketing world .
Because if you know , you know what I 'm talking about .
The truth is more than that .
" It was better when he was better when he was a worse , " The reason he was better when he was going to be worst when he was a worst as a way that was a kind of surprising .
So , in the world that we live -- opulent -- opulent industrialized , industrialized , the massive massive massive , we can hope is that the things are going to be hoping is that the altest .
You 've never been surprised to be surprising because your waaaitative , the myself is ingiant ingives .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse , " Well , " Well , " Yes , " Yes , " Yes , you want . "
I mean , a little moment moment -- that 's actually actually made and my wife is really sitting and my wife is really study .
I won 't have to do better , I 'm not accounted .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of the jeans , and it 's just that kind of jeans is that when there 's just that when you 're not saying , and you ask you ? " Why do you ? "
" Who is responsible ? " " Well , the answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What could you do you do it ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a sleep , and you ask you , and you ask you , and you ask you , it 's responsible , it 's the responsible responsible .
You 're going to do better .
With hundreds of varietetetety , there 's no choice for the insuccessful .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is valido , they 're senting , they 're going to insodate and they 're going to them .
In the last years , the last few years , it 's expression in the world industrialized world .
I think a fat meaning -- not the only one , but important -- I think -- this once of depression is that people have expression of the depression because the standard are too alts .
And when they have to explain this situation think they 're going to be .
So the result is that in general is that we 're better , objected , but we feel worst .
Let me remember that you remember .
This is the dogen coufficial , what we all take for good and it is completely fashion . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit better than a little choice is better than that you don 't have to get that a little bit better than that a little better than a little bit of a little bit .
There is a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure that we have superfored by a piece of the scels , the best weless of our life .
Now , from the vision of vision , I 've almost finished -- from the political vision is the following cy-jumping , the name is the following .
What you lost all this choice in society , is the recognize .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have a choice .
The problem is that they 're too poorse .
So the face of the face that I 'm talking about is a disease , remember is a modern exclusive modern , remember society .
