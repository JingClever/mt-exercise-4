The year year I 've shown these are going to show that the calculartics , which is a glacial simillions of years had had had the simillions of 48 cent-continental continental continue , is record of the United States .
But that sound this sound is the gravity of the problem because I don 't show it .
The glacial artics is , in a sense , the cuit 's a sense , the cummate system .
You can extent and you can revered .
The next next 25 years .
The lapighborhood are red in red red red .
As you see , you see , you can see it .
That 's the ice ice ice in the ice , which is ritive .
You can see that the cosix , of five years or five years , is as the site , is as the sanguy here , which is a site of the body here .
In 25 years is a long time ,
This is a problem because the interesthreacting the third of the ocean artical ocean where there are huge of carbon the ocean , who are huge of carbon , sciently , they 're transformed in metimes .
As the totality of the inatmosfertic record , that quantity could be able to reach , that quantity could be able to be able around .
In some laghi , in Alaska , the metan is already already ,
The professor Katey Walter of University in the University of Alaska long-h-based .
Video : Wow Gore : I 'm going to be good . The question is if we 're going to be .
A reason this scale scale , the third Groenland from the northern Groenland from the northern .
This is a further regime .
The brought was never reach them .
This is the Kangerluslier Kangerlushing , in the Groenland .
If you want to know how the lighighborhood to be able to be able to be able to be able to add the mate .
These corrents are caumenting .
Another part of the planet : Antttttartttttartttttartttttarttttarttttttartttttttice .
The scientists have swaked , they directed that the gationship is in negative , and that Antttarttttartttton some of a hysole , is particularly , is particularly in the sungative .
Every six meters of the active level , as a Groenland .
Sulf Himalayer , the largest terial terial , they see new laghi , who were a new laghi , who were many years ago .
The 40 percent of the world was recost will be going to be able to be a population .
Sulle Angone : this game is the bottom of water .
The land-hunger .
But when it diminugly , the same access water .
In California on the Sight Nevada is diminually .
The gets recognize is .
The predictions , like you have a lective .
The growth of the world 's growth of a night .
The environmental environmental record out of the normal and without precedents .
Four times more number number of the last 30 years , I 've been precedents 75 .
This is a handing of all instainable .
If you look at the context , if you can see the consequences .
The last five years , we have to add 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 24 hours of the oceans every day .
Look at the Pacific area , and the American Every , and in the American parts , and both th th saves , where there is a radical hygen , where there is a radical impoor , where there is a radical imself .
Most of global rescale , together together , together to deforest , which is 20 percent , is the 20 percent , is the On of the commercial .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with the most emissions , together .
And it 's proposed to build a lot of other carbon .
But we 're going to be a change .
These are the designers , the last years and some of some of the last years and some of a verage .
And every way , there is a politics in our Paese Paese Paese .
The carbon the carbon oil and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year for the last year for the coal cost , which is a ossimal , which is a simer of the coal .
And I remember I remember a --
I want to know Nath in Tennespurther , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion of a 3.8 billion of carbon .
I 've seen it , you 've seen .
This is the largest floor scories in America .
It 's success around Natal .
The published nature of a coal industries of carbon .
Video : It 's a coal , " Frosty is a kind of allegry ,
It 's abondant here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
Frosty the carbon is always lilisty .
It 's a good good , adorathy and worth worers are handing .
Al Gore : Da is a coal of the West Virginia .
The largest society is Massey Coast Coast Coast Coast Coast .
Video : Don Blankenship : Sarry , Al Gore , Nancy Peloes -- Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima of Clima .
This is a part of it , one part .
Video : Actor : ALergy see the climate change as a serious serious change as a serious serious .
For this is investment to be a big quantity of money in a large of money in a such to make public public , and conflict the public of carbon .
In fact , the carbon is not sport .
We think it 's a good -- it 's also a good good provide .
So , not pre-cupateves of change change .
Let me do us .
Video : Actor : Carbon -- you have heard to talk about it .
So , I do a y-free structure , a structure of the coal structure ,
Straordinary machine is a little bit of the human coal .
The consumption is between the main the main rescale , but the night , the night of the global technology , but the night of the carbon .
You have a lot of this is the technology of the coal technology of the coal coal .
Al Gore : As the end , the alternative positive , and that 's the economic national cheap and that 's national national security .
Video : Comativity : The economy , the economy , the sure , the crisis , the crisis .
The challenge that college of our dependence from the cost of the coal cost , as the coal oil and the oil and the important .
Now , I 'll be a new , audaily , audaily solution .
Repower of America : 100 percent energy , in the old ,
A pian to make the global work , make sure it , and to make sure , and to stop the global rescale .
Finally , a solutionary solve .
Repower . Scouple .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Yeah , it 's record to America .
One of the most fast fast at the end of the end of the end of the mistainable to be able to our planet .
What it 's the future is here . I 'll be here . I 'll be a new energy .
What you 're going to do two two , Nugers investment for places .
Comment : Repower . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old , you want to go to go to go to go to go to go to go to slow us , go to solar .
If you want to go back , go back , go to . "
We have to go to go back , fast fast .
Thank you very much .
They 're going to TED TED TED feculation on the LHC .
And I promies to reach to go to go to go to the machine .
So , I 've got to be . And the other time there were no , the largest scientific experiment .
His a complex is to recognition conditions that they were just a billion on the universe -- until 600 million times .
All of this is just a great .
This is the machine Ginevra .
We 're going to be a mini-Bang Bang Bang Bang inside .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- is a large 44 feet and a diameter of 22 feet .
This is a picture of ATLATLAS in building building .
The 10 snice year we have accesum year we have access to the first time .
And this picture was written by AS .
It 's a control of immense , in the saving of control .
It 's a picture of the first picture of the first particles that he had done all the LHC , both , both of the LHC , and I 've got a part of the LHC , and sponing particles in the LHC , and I 've got out of the winside of the first time .
In other words , when we see that imagine the image 10 settember , we understand that the machine works , the the machine .
I don 't know if it was that I don 't have to do more open to Google and jule , and I went to Google and the page of the beginning was this .
What we had a cultural impact .
For a week after , there was a problem with the machine , and they had to these challenge here -- these challenge here -- these challenge gained .
These challenge 133,000 legs when machine works at the massive works .
Now , the technical technical , and they 're going to be . They 're not true . They 're too sottttical . "
And they can do that because when they 're very clean cosidings .
So , at least 271 , at a temperature in the space of the space between space and the physical space , these field , these field , these guys can bring that corrent .
In one of the most nothing of the most nothing in the LHC , there was a dispsplective of free .
So the further , they 're going to read a lot , and 13,000 feet , and 13,000 feet .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think that these magnetnetwork , and that these magnetnetwork , and that they have about 30 centimeters .
They 're saying about 50 magnetic .
We had to take them , what we have done .
We have repress and favored .
Now , they 're returning all of their place .
I mean , the end of the walth LHC will be new integro .
We 're going to be going to do , and we expect to get to juge data , and then we continue to find our result for what they are the morning to discover what they 're going on the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these clean , these clean , these clean value of the science and engineering the engineering of the conscious conconcontempt .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact of the limits , I think it 's the value of things like LHC .
I want to conclude with a scientist Inglan Inglan Inglan-As , the imagine , which , the imaginy , in the inutionary , and the experiments of his puler , his own , and he said , " Nichael Fararadn , " Niian , the humans of the human ideas , and the words of the human science , and they 're not to be a lot of the human nature of the humans , which is that they 're not ,
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to rethink when you , kids , to go up , and you play .
And you know , how to reach them and further , and they 're going to take them and move them , learning , learning to think and record of the relations of the relationship of relations .
The reasoning is properly connected to the way we understand part of the world around us .
So , from the information from the atisn of our interaction with the existic physical interaction , and my collaborator , and my collaborator , and my collaborator , I started to ask , I started to ask me , when we 're a computer , instead of the world , as we 're going to have a computer , I could have a computer , I 've been been a fleaving , a lot of a physical poor , and I could have a physical information ,
and sistly our paciment furpoor ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to exploring the answer , and I built .
In a Sift-Siftable computer interactive , as a bircost .
In a Sift-Siftable computer interactive , as a bircost .
You can move to move to hand , can see , you can see between their movement and they have a screen and a rawireless .
But it 's objects , they 're objects , as the morrow , you can move to be able to be further .
Sift-cost of a new ecosycle system to manipulate the information .
And as they become more physical , consciousness , and the other people , and hand , and and hand , and the hand , as a free of other people , as we can exploring them , we can exploring new , and different different interaction .
I 'll just just like a lot of example .
This Sift-configurate for video video : if you winine , the video gurate video , the video gap , if you 're going to go back to the other way .
These ritical interactive are connected to other other other .
If they 're interested in that they 're interested in what it is their own .
If they 're circumults , they 're going to get a little bit .
If they 're circumults , they 're going to get a little bit .
They have truth their movement and inclination .
We 're realized that one of the interaction was the power of the interaction was the power of the interaction , to example , " a color , " a color like if it was a liqueer .
We have three Siften , we have three Siften configure out of the color in the central , where you 're missing to the color in the central , where they 're missing .
I can use them to make them to talk about the color in the central , where you can .
If we 're too , we can put a little bit .
There are also beautiful possibility of appears , as the lines and yes , the mathematics and logical people who can try to try to see the things things , and see you see it 's the result .
Now , I 'm going to --
This is a sequence of Fibonacks that I do with a program .
We have a player of words that is half of Scarabeer and Bogle .
Patically , at all the remember of a literally , in the Siftable , Pratically , and a remember , at every Sift-hy-h-hy-hand , as a control of people who compories on a control .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new new lectable and new possibility to try to try to try .
Thank you .
Here 's what the children came to the Media Lab , I did it , I did it and I 've been a video .
They 're very ,
And one of the things that kind of things that you know , you don 't have to give you a lot of education .
I just say , " What 's words , " What they have a lot of words .
Here 's other people who are trying to try it .
This is our young ger , there 's a young , there 's a right .
It was just just just just improve them .
They 're just morning , for him .
Now , this is a application of a interactive application .
We wanted to build a tools to the landweld language is Felix .
It 's just inserve new personally , solved the Siften , solved their lililisociated .
It 's just inserve new personally , solved the Siften , solved their lililisociated .
That 's what we use the sole .
Video : The source is a segenous .
David Merries : Now , it 's a tractor in the scinner .
Video : The tractor .
By work ! Yeah !
So , I got the Sift-hundreds , and you can get the characters .
Video : Bau !
-- inventing the history .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It 's a story with a story , and you can decide , and you can decide .
DM : It 's a story with a story , and you can decide , and you can decide .
Video : Vice .
Deebring , I 've got a time to show you is a tool , realized , to figure and sleep and exequal and exequal musical .
It 's one , I realized , to figure and exequy musical and sleep musical .
Siften Siften suons like battery , basically , and the battery .
Ognize of these four different variations , and you can write .
You can inside these suons in a sequence of a compories to your hundred .
And it 's just just just touch a suund , " and a sequence . "
These are actually control of the visual visual visual , as the reverse .
People are a particular supplies and then including it .
And then there are the fact of the fact , and I want to get to interest .
Let 's look at it .
Video : DM : We 're going to put a base in two Siftable , " systems , " systems , we add to a series , we add the other base .
Now , I 've got a line .
Video : Now , I 've got to add --
Video : And I 'll put the filtery , so I can control the battery , so I can control the view of the view .
Video : I can see quickly quickly the intersequence in the time , by one one one on the other .
Video : I 'll add the filters on the flow .
Video : I can see it sequence the sequence .
So I won 't have to be before , but I can improvate , it 's longer , it 's longer .
And now , I finally , I can sleep the intersequence the entire sequence the Siften ftable . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is built , and the whole whole whole whole of the best works and more more sounds as our brain works .
And I had time to show you one of the results of this exactly , and some possibility that we 're trying to bring out of the laboratory .
The concept that I want to get to this new generation of objects for the whole new generation to interaction with the digital digital world , which will be going to our information in the way that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see it now with all you .
I 'm a scrring .
I 'm going to write books is more than this , of course .
It 's also the love and the love of my life .
And I don 't expect to change .
But , I said , this is successful recently in my own own own life and my carrier , which was taken to remember the interest with this work .
The particular thing I recently scriting this book , this biography called " Manogy , Pull , Pull , Ame , " What , the different book , the different book , for some reason , for some reason , and it 's a big sensitive , and it 's a big sensitive , and it 's a big , and it 's a big , and it 's a big cedents called the whole book .
And the result is that anywhere , people are going to me , people who was conditive me as if I was conditive .
Davail -- condanned , condanned ,
They 're going to me now , and they say , " I don 't hate to be able to be able to do better ?
I don 't have to keep to write the life without pose to be able to create a book that can create a book that ? "
What can you do someone ? "
It 's rassumption , you know .
But it could go to the worse , I remember than 20 years ago , when I started to say , I was a adolescent -- I wanted to say , I wanted to be a scritical scritical scritical scritical scritical .
I was going to meet the same reaction .
And people say , " I said , " I don 't tel to be able to be success ?
I don 't hundred the hubility of the killed you ?
I don 't hold this to do this for all life without that nothing to be ever out and death out of a heart custand death with a heart custinfrants with the both both both of the amount of hyoung ? "
So , you know , you know .
The answer -- the answer to all these questions is : " Yeah . "
I 've got a couple of all things .
I 've always had a couple .
And I also have a lot of other things that people can 't inside .
As the other things .
But , as I look at the write I was going to write what I was a last mulate ?
It 's rational rational ?
It 's logical that anyone is to be spent to be spent to be spent to be spent to do .
But what 's a particular way , it 's so particularly to make us about the saving saved the saving of the saving other careers ?
How my father , for example , he was a engineeeeeeemist and I don 't remember in the 40 years of the 1940s , if they were asked to be engineeeeeering ?
Do you 've never -- that blows John , like John , like it ?
Do not work , you know , you know , you know , ?
Onestly , the engineers as they have a group don 't have certainly , in the secos of being alcovered the reputation of being hands .
We have been scring , we have enough to be a reputation , and not just scring you , we have this reputation of a huge instainable of being huge instainable to be huge .
And I 'm not to look at the trilate of the magnifield of the magnifies , just in the 1th century , they 're death , they die , they 're death , they 're death , they 're death , they 're going to be .
And the people who are not going to be recognition data .
Norman Mailer , before I die , in the last interview , " Ogams my book is a little bit of a longer , " A free of the lifurther of the work of the work .
But we don 't have to be able to say , because we have heard these things that we 've heard these things that we have completely interized and the notion of the creativity and the notion of the clean and that 's a way of inside , and that art , and that art , in the end of the ances , and that art .
And the question I want to do all of the today is , you 're in the accordo with this idea ?
I 'm going to be -- because you 're looking at a centimage of a distance , I 'm not going to be good for nothing .
I think it 's odiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodio
And I think it 's also , and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better incorrecate our big creative creative creative .
And I 'm sure that , in my case -- I was very dangerous -- it would be very dangerous to what I 'm going to be a supposposition , soon the circustances in which are in my carrier .
Of course , I 'm looking at , I 'm like , I 've been about 40 years .
I still have about four decauses .
And it 's very likely that any thing I 'll be right now , I 'm going to be right now , and I use the spent of the last my last book .
I 'm going to sleep , because we 're all more friends here -- is likely that my largest is to my largest wait .
Oh , Gesave , that I think I think it 's !
You know that this is the genious genious person to start to start to start to start to be in the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would like to keep this work that we 're going to do this work .
So , the question is , how ?
And so it looks like , after many reflective , that the way to work to keep and to write is to create a couple of psychologic projective , OK ?
I had a lot of some way to find a lot of sure of sure , I 'm write , and my natural anxide , and my natural reaction that I was trying to get to be , and I was trying to do it . And as I was trying to look at the time , and I was trying to see other society and we could have to see other societies .
and how to help people believe that people create the inerents , inerents of creativity .
And that research was a Grece Rome and anancient Rome .
I 'm going to go back and then back in a certain and then back .
Nels Green and the anancient Rome -- people don 't look like creativity to creativity , OK ?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit , and that 's about the high and that would be a few people from a few people distant , for reasons , for reasons , for reasons .
They were called these days , they were about the spiriters of creativity . "
Socate , wonderful , it 's just created a demon a demon the sagges .
The Romanaged were the same idea , but they call that that this species of spirit .
The one is a great because the Romanaged , because the Romanaged , they 're going to be intelligent .
They have to be a genious genious kind of ininina , which is a living in the study of a study of a study , a little bit like the eless of a artist , and that 's going to be able to be able to work .
Eastoni--- here is the distance of which is the distance of what I word that I word that cost you protegets , which is the result of your work .
And all of the knowledge , right ?
So the artists were protects from certain things , as for example , as a too narcism , no ?
If your work was except that except not could take it all the mercial , all of the way , all of the way , they 're held to be able to be able to be .
If your work , if your work , it was not all collives , right ?
All they know that was your genious .
And so people who han concepiece of creativity in Occident for a lot of time .
Then Rinesesespean and it changed , and it 's going to be human . We put the human being at the human human the universe of the universe and misters and misters without more and leaves and the misters that write .
This was the principle of human eximum and people started thinking about that creativity came to think that the creativity of the ishared by the ishared .
And for the first time in the history , you can reference that the artist as a genius to a genius that a person with a person with a person with a person with the genium .
And I have to tell you , I think that was a big herror .
I think of it 's a simple person to believe , a simple person to be like a recient , the essential , the essential surgers , the surgers , creationship , creationship , creationship , inconnected to a very big .
It 's like to take someone to ingoes .
Deform and distories , and creates all these ingestible injectable on permance .
And I think it was this pression to the artists in the past artists in 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it 's the question , and now ?
We can do that different ?
Magary , to a more more more more than human relationship between human relationship and mistery .
Or maybe no .
We can 't be square we cannot swasn 't a talk about 18 minutes .
And they probably have to be in the audience that would be law , I would be living scientific on the notion of the neighborhood , insound , and they follow people who are the people .
It 's not going to be not to be all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to take is -- why no ?
Why don 't I think that ?
Because it 's more sense of any other thing that I 've ever heard to explain the exactly improve .
A process , as anyone that I 've ever tented to do something -- so , all of the fundamentally , all here , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , all of the way that you 've ever ever ever ever ever ever ever , so , all of the way , all of the way ,
And , you can look at it , it can look at completely paranormal .
I 've done this meeting , I 've done with the extraordinary poeth Ruth Stone , which was 90 years , but it was a poetet-year-old life and said that he was a poety in the Viriny , and he was a little bit of the winy , and I was a little bit of the spoeting , when I was a poety .
I said that he was a fragorous fragorous .
And that was rotate to her from her from the couple .
I 've heard to get , because he was a tremendous under the land .
He had to have a solve thing to do that point and she was , and she words like a map . "
And then record and came up to the house and came from this poetic , and they don 't have to get another piece of card and a piece of card , as the traped , as the traped , as the traped , as the page , and floor the page .
I can 't be enough , I can 't be fast , so correcord and record and record out of the home and the poetrotoled and the perhaps of his house and , and it would continue to be hundred , like she said , " I said , " one one another . "
Then there were the times -- this piece of the piece -- there were moments -- there were moments in which was almost almost allows , OK ?
So , she was saying , and she was trying to be trying to be trying to be a mate , and he was a hunger in , and she said , and he said , and she said , and he said , and he said , and he said , and he said , and he said ,
He was the writing writing the body and the reput in his body and transmed the body and transcritical page .
And in these cases , the poor is going to be presented on the perfect , and the last word at the last word .
So when I think I 'd feel -- it 's couple , is exactly the process .
I don 't have a creative process -- I 'm not a conditiative conditiative .
I 'm a music , and my way of work is , and I 'm saving to the same time and I have to work and I 'm going to work and pass to be a gogoal .
But I even even even , in my head , I met , I met that what ,
And I imagine a lot of you have a han .
You know , even if I work and the ideas was dought to be a certain of a certain certain way .
What is this thing ?
And as we can relationship to exhise us to be able to do it , but , it 's a lot of that we do it ?
For how I look at the best example , the best example , I was the musician , which is the musician , which I 've interview to a day , which I 've interview for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of the life was the incarnation of the artist of the artist artist , trying to contemporary contemporary , gesty-control of these species of impults .
But then , I 'm going to go , and a day as he was widing on a day , and he was driving on a Los Angeles , changed everything .
He was going to go back and all of a traction of a little framment of heloters , which arrive in his head , and the long-halls , and the longer , and the halls , and it was the hyounger , and it was not like to get it .
It doesn 't have a piece of card , it doesn 't have a record .
So I started to feel this species of a sweld , " I 'm going to be a site , and I 'm going to lose , and I 'll see , and I 'll see .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And I 'm going to go to the wind , you 're going to stop .
I 'll be the interest process and further .
I 'm just going to be the top and said , " Scycle , " Scycle , I 'm going to be ? "
" To you look like a song .
If you really want to be , back in a more opposite , when I can take me me to take me .
Altries , you 're important to do anything else .
I want to disturba Leonard Cohen . "
And his process to work , it was changed after this .
I 'm not the work was always spot .
But the process , and the fish was that I was record , and I was record when the genious genious genious , the genious genious , the genious thing that 's going to go back to where it was going to be a whole thing to be a whole thing .
But it 's a little bit of this peculisten , wonderful neighborn to a conversation between Tom and this thing , and I was not Tom .
So as the story that history I was going to change a little bit the way I was working in my way I was saved a time .
This idea , I was going to write when I was written , " Ama , Ama , and I said , a cell of those cave ccave in which we 're working on the disperation of the discovered , and we 're starting to think that it will be a disaster .
Not just burges , just the worst book .
And I started to think about this project .
But then I remember to Tom that I worked at the air and try .
So I thank my face in the hands on the hands and I got my hundreds of a vmmmen .
And I said , " Sents , " Sents , what 's both of the book , you know , if this book is not going to be a neighborhood , no interactly ,
Because as I see that I 'm going to see what I , I don 't have more than this .
So if you want to be better , you have to presenting you and make your part .
OK . But if you don 't have it , I don 't know what I 'm not going to do .
I 'll go to write the same because it 's my work .
And I want to do for me that was a represented I was a represented to do my part -- and I 've got , I 'm so OK , in the deserts of Africa , and it 's so , in the deserve of the dances of the dances of the hours of the hours and hours that they were hours to the hala .
And they were always magnific , because the balleres were very successful .
But every hyours , something happening , and one of these artists was actually transcent .
And I know what you know , because I know you have a way you have all of , a way , a way , a performance .
It was as if you stop time , and the ballery wald up a kind of a different kind of a different kind of different , as a 1,000 of different slights , but all of the 1,000 , but it 's all of the sallineed .
And at the improvement , I don 't know , as a human human human .
But it 's going to be a sunder and under the slightly in the winity .
And when this happens , I had to temptempers , people know , the people who was called the name .
They were hands and and starts and starts to cantate , " Allah , Allah , God , God , God , God , "
That 's God , you know .
Aurious noise -- when Ments invasering the Spaith of Spay , and the sound of the Spay , and the pronce of the Spull Allah , Allah , Allah , " that you can hear in the corner .
In Spay , when a artist , I have made something , " Allah , " Allah , " Well , Allah , I was , " incomprecord , I was a scort of God .
And it 's a great because we need .
But , the problem is the problem , to the same , to the same same , when you see the same , and I discopy that are 11 of Marttee of Marttedary and I won 't have .
It 's just a mortal mortal ginoccurred to the ginoccurrent , and maybe never get to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to the ginoccurrent .
And maybe nobody will be the name of God still as as as I go to cost the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most recognilization to do in a creative life .
But maybe maybe you 're not so much as much as much if you can 't believe , sleep , that the most extraordinary , which wait , that the most extraordinary of your same .
But they think you 're going to be data in prestable to a inimaginable inininininininininininininininable to any life that you 've got to get up .
And , you know , if we think about this is it .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's sure , and it 's sure as I thought for different months in the book that published , I 'll take the rest , the periood , the dangerous , the spent time , the dangerous , and it 's going to do my success .
And what I have to keep me when I feel like this is , I feel that is not , I don 't have a couple .
I don 't go to your work . It 's just your work .
And we can be a representing you to be .
If your work is balling ,
If the site , I asked up , I asked to leave a few of wonderful , for a wonderful , for a moment , for a moment through your site , " Ole . "
Altries , you have the same your dance .
" Ole ! "
I think it 's a teacher .
" Os the same , you know , even for the human hours and head and head , and head of you get to get you to get you to keep continue .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As I 've been talking about some of these designs on the human genome , on what can can meaning and the discovered new genome .
Now we 're starting a new perspent , we started digitalizing the biology and now , and now in particular new that code , we 're going to be in a new of biology , designing and sintetic , designing and sintetic sent siting .
We 've always tried to take big questions .
" What is life ? " What 's a lot of biologers I think they 're told to understand that .
We tried to have different approach , reduced to the terms .
We 're going to digitalizing from 20 years .
When we have sequenced the human genome is a hundred of the world 's world of biology in the world .
Now , we ask life , we can regenerate life , or create new life from this universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genome , which is the most small of the little of the little of the little of the gome who can auty in the laboratory .
And we tried to reduce the genome of genome to created one again .
We 're able to eliminate a centinaaail of of the genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we see a metabolic mapy , is relatively , is a relatively to our .
I think that is simple .
But when we look at all genes we can eliminate , one , is very improbutable that this can bring to a cellent cellent .
So we decided that the only only only only protected to protected this cromososom to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to take some of these questions .
And so we started the " Posan we 're sintetic site a cromosoma ? "
I 'll be the chimics context of these big big molecules that we 've never been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a cromosoma works ?
A cromosome is just a piece of a cyerself .
The fast fast we 're able to digitalizing life is going to be grow .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , and it 's better , but it 's better .
And our more recent received on a curve curve on a curve .
We 've been starting to 15 years ago .
The process process is requires , began with a bioetic revision , first I started to be first experiments .
But we discovered that DNA is very difficult .
There are a thousands of the world that producing little segments of DNA , of the long long , of the long 30 to 50 lectionary , and it 's a process of the segment is long , the more , the more , the herrors .
So we have to develop a new metodo , and fly these framments and correturns out the herrors .
And this was our first telling , in particularly , in particularly , in the PPPPPPP174 .
It 's a little virus that kills .
We have designed the framments , effective correcord of the errors and I got a molecule of DNA about 5,000 lectable .
The interesting part is when we 've got a piece of chemic material , and we 've been involved in the batterns , the batterns , the batterns , and protected to be able to be able to read this code .
The viral particles are going to leave the cells , are back back and they go back and they distrstruted .
I 've talked about the recent of the oil industries that they have certainly comprest that they have certainly comprest that they have a model .
They have to be more than you .
We think that is a situation in which the software can actually build the same immediate in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in the largest things .
We wanted to build the interest .
I 'm more than 58000s .
So we thought about the size of the size of the size of virus , so that they could change the components to understand what the components are the cellent .
The design design is crucial designers , and if we start with digital computers in a computer , these have to be accurate .
When we sequencyourself for the first time in 1995 , the first accurate was a herror for every 10 miles .
We discovered , we discovered , 30 errors , if we have been used that sequence .
One part of the process is to create segments to 50 lectable to be able with all the other segments of the other segments of 50 lectable to build sound ,
We 're going to be a lot of things here .
We have a lectelling us that we inserve the field .
Think , we have a genetic code , we have a genetic based on four , and To , and Ten .
And there 's a lectest together about 20 friend , and there is a specific long-ter-order to be a specific order to each friend .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , almost , almost , almost , almost , and it 's going to be a code .
What we 've done in the beginning was the beginning .
Some of the fact that was the fact that it was not poia .
We have designed these segments for just a lot of simply only only to be unclear .
There are the exists that they 're going to put them them .
And we started to make them to make the parts , began with segments , and a hundred of a 7 , unendols to make segments of 24 mile , and until the until lunder of 24 mile .
We have produced these sequency , we have produced these sequencing sequencing a process of create a process of create a process .
We 're trying to take a process .
So , this seems to be the tabell-basket player .
When we go to these segments very long , more than 100 mile , the most 100 missions , not grow up in Ecocoli .
It 's a limits of the limits of biology .
So we 've been a lot of other month .
We had to have another muntil we had called recombination recombination , which in biology , which in biology to talk about the DNA in the sunt of the only segments .
Here 's a example .
This organism , called Deinococus , it can assues three million running three million running of radiation .
You can see in the result as his hromosoma , and he 's gainy .
In 12 -- 24 hours is before .
They 're thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can sex completely .
They can live under ,
I 'm assolutely certainly , and you have to find new environments .
The NASA is , NASA has shown that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we 've built these processing processing with design appropriate with design appropriate design .
The light-assemble ,
This picture was not scape with a microscopic eletic microscopic , but with a microscopic rules .
It 's a molecule that we can see with a microscope with a microscopile .
These are picture that they 're a period of about six seconds .
This is the publishing that we 've done time .
I 'm more than 580,000 lectable to code genetic .
It 's the largest molecule of a strong structure .
It 's a lot of a 300 million hours .
If we 're going to be a career of 10 , and they would like 142 page , they would like 142 page for a critical code .
Now , how we do it works ? We can account it ?
Of course , a virus is a game of girls .
It 's a little bit more complicated when they use the batterns .
It 's the simpler of cells as the cell eucaries as our own , you can just extremrate the nucleo and inserve a nucleo , which is the process of clonation .
In the battern cromososometimes is integrated in the cells , but we have recently dependent , but we have recently to do a trick cromosome that we 're able to be able to one .
We have a cromosoma participate , by a microbial species .
The two are different as men from the opopen .
We 've got a lot of gene in the way to decide what I wait for this cromosoma .
The scientists , and I got to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cells was study -- and apprecious our graphical sophistices -- the new cromoon .
And we started that we were not going to go to go , but we tried to spactive .
This is one of the evolution of evolution .
We found that anti-species have been add a second or a third of a thromosososososososometimes in a second new new of new trath , and a thousands of new trath .
So , who think about evolution as a gene , as a time to be modific of biology .
They 're also also also , the exhibition called me restrike to be digit .
The cromosome that was in the cells .
The cell phula-cromosoma we have inserit-h-h-h-h-h-h-cromosound .
It 's expresent , and it recognized the other cromososososometimes , and we 're rraised with just the cells , and we 're reritromosome .
It 's become became a cut of genes that we 've inserious .
And in a short time , all the cartoistic cartoistic cartoy , and it 's transformed in a new new way , and it 's transformed on the new software in the new software in the cells .
Everything is changed , the memethure-changed , and when we go the code code the genetic code exactly what we have been transfertioning .
Now , this may look at the genetic genetic genetic , but altering the software in the way .
Now , I 've already explained that here doesn 't talk about the genespurs of the evolution , and I 've said that we 're going to create a new version of evolution , and I 've said that we 're going to create a new of the expatterns that will be new new process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's enough , when we think about our necessity .
We 're going to past six billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give example , I was none in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for the obnation in 1946 , 40 years , there will be four .
We 're going to find food , water fresh , water , water , water and they 're saving , and a lot of people .
It will still be more to do that for nove billion .
We 're more than five billion , the more than 30 billion , the longer of 30 billion baries .
What it means to millions of baries .
When we 're going to find biological processes , or any kind of process to remping them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to have a lot of the CO2 of CO2 from these materials that finished in the atmosphere .
Al day , I have to discovered scientific , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are the components to think that are components for the future .
The industries just a dozen possibly about a dozen dozen , and think about how many things are they come out .
We 're limits here is the major biological biological .
We have a techniques , thank you very much of a sintetization , in fact , we call the genomics .
We 're able to build a big robot that can provide a million cromosomes .
Think of processing these 20 million genes different genes or different processing to try to be a process to produce or a lot of drugs , and create change , and create change , we can change , and create , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology .
And it 's just a selection .
We can write them to be able to be living , production , production or carbon , production , production of vaccines .
This is a few software of a software programmed to be able to be able to be able to secate species .
Well , we don 't know , we 're going to be .
We know exactly , it 's their code .
We 're now concentrate on the carbon of quarters .
You 've seen you see that you can see that experiment was a finished by the window .
We have carbon second-third generation that use is enough to be very context of the glonger than the homoms as the test or as the test or different kinds of butters .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without a big impact without the food , and limited food and limited States the disponing , and limited to create the cell of the cell . We 're working for designing to design . We 're working for designing to work for the cell . We 're working on the way , and think of the coaling of the garms of the world .
The light light solar combined with CO2 is a metodoor in our discover all the world , we have found different different metods .
This is a organism we have described in 1996 .
You 're going to be about 2500 feet , about 2500 feet of the water .
They 're metan hydrogen from CO2 , we 're going to idd-energy energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can indog CO2 , which can be translate to be translate , convertic , convertil that can be able to iddle that .
For that short we think we could be able to aumenting what the question of the question of the base that is the life is the " is the Not of the " is Not -- we have the modness of the entire industrial interest .
Exist . If you can 't do it from TED , where you can you do it ?
It would be a main the main energy .
And we 're working for the same metimes we 're going to create vaccines .
You 've seen this year with influence , we 're always back to a year , and a year , and a dollar when it 's a tunch of the right .
I think that that you can change , and we can build accinable to combinable to be a little bit .
Here 's how the future could we look at change , now , the alalbural evolution , accerating the evolution of evolution with batterns , and infinally , and infinally , and infinally , and infinally , and infinally , and infinally , and inside , and inside , and inden it 's going to be changing , and inside , and inside the claries .
We 're going to be so on the best people .
Our is to do it in a way of living enough to try to try to be . Thank you very much .
And I 'll just just see , the most rapidly possible , some of the most fundamental , of the new technology that we 've taken to the Microsoft in the way , and it 's a year ago .
It 's a very local environment that you can interaction is a large of visual data .
We 're seeing molecule photos of digital photos with a kind of zos and continue , for a fast , to a fast , disponing the images like we want .
And it doesn 't be a big quantity of information that we see , how these are great things that we see , as these are great data or images .
Most of the photographs are digital digital , but this for example is a scansion of the Congress of Congress , and reentering in the Congress of 300 megap .
Not no difference because the only thing that limited prestations of a system system like this is the number of a perable system on your pattern in the skills . It 's a very flexible architecture .
This is a book book , this is a book , you don 't images .
This is the Casa desoled of Dickens . Ogams ,
For you show you that it 's just a lot of images , and you can 't do a thing that is a kind of a kind of a representation of a representation , you can 't do that photos .
It could be a way to read a little tell-neighborhoood .
I don 't want to be .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the Look .
Every games is the beginning of a section .
And you 're going to be the beautiful experience and beautiful experience of a version of a revision or a quotic review of a quotic physical plice .
We also have a lot of this number of this number of the United States .
We 've created a published published , much more alysical -- much more alysis a normal published -- and we have inserious .
If you want to see the carring carring , you can see here .
Or other model , or even specific technic technic .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
I love to say that this means that that you can put it up and other port , and you 're not to be necessary .
Naturally , the mapplications is one of the most of the most of technology .
And on this is not going to slow time , if we don 't know that we have to say that we have to be in this cameleleld .
These are all the streets in U.S.
So now we 're going to be anything else .
This is now , this is actually the visual web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynnth , which is two different technologies .
A is Seadragon and the other is a research , a very interesting interesting interesting , a very interesting , student of the University , a student of the University of Steve Steve Steve Sezisland , with the U.S.
And it 's from Swind , gestures from Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can past from one imagine and have this kind of extent experience .
But the location of the picture here has effective .
The horites of visualization of the computer have recorded these images , in way that correspond to the place that images the images of the images that images -- all the pictures -- all the slaghi , they 're going to see .
I don 't know if I 've been time to show you some other environment .
There are some more photograph .
I want to past one of the original data , and this is a preclear -- and this is from a precent precedent of Photosynthree-totype . And this is that we 've made the first time , to show you what it is really clear . And this is not necessarily , the technology that we have to be able to look at the environments . And this is not necessarily looking at the web .
We had to worry about the wait , and I 'm going to say .
This is a rebuild the catteam of Notice Dr. Bast Flickr . Bast digitate Notice Din Flickr and you get images of the images , other field , other wases , other wrote , other wines and on the way . Ognize of these connected .
So , they 're all images from Flickr and they 're all college in this way .
And it 's possible to be a way of simple .
You know , I 've never thought about the finished to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifting this kind of across here .
I think you 're going to see that it is a lot of different accept of different different physical cell phone of the physical physical physical physical , a number of meaning , a number of meaning , and it 's a number of different ways .
And if we 're going to be trying to try to try to be to try to be .
Many are block , etc , etc .
And somewhere here is a series of photography -- and , and that 's a cole .
This is a poster of Notre Dame record .
We can spent from the vision of this environment .
The point is that we can do with the environment . This is now now now is a south of the social intermemory , from the intermemory , from the land of the land , from the way , from the vist of the way .
All those pictures are college together , most of the sometimes .
You have a model of the interest that emerging .
Think about this as a free of the Stephen Lawler 's slier on Earth .
It 's something that grow up in complexity , and the people use , and the saves that you 're going to use the audience with the authior .
They have picture of the picture are hundreds of other people .
If someone one is the idea of the idea of the name , I 've got these name , my picture of Nototice Doting Do Do Do Dadadaddress , and I can use how to use it . And I can use as a point of a kind of a space , and I can use the universe , and I can use the other cle-her-hyours of the world , and have a red physical hysical way of the cle-momomomoment of the crowd .
Naturally , a consequence of all of that are model of all interesting , of every interesting , I tell you , I told you , and you don 't even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even like that .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand what your software , what your software to do is that a certain point , in the next years , in the next years , all the photographs , all the photographs , all the people would have to be together ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's what it 's about is discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the images of images .
The thing is very interesting , if you think about the recycity of information semantic information .
As when you do a research , you 're digit , you 're digit , and the test of the web -- a lot of information about the picture of the picture .
Now , what happens if you have to be picture to all the voice ?
So the quantity of interconnection and the quantity of the exactly and the amount of recognize that is a huge of the will be a classic effect of the will be a classic effect of the will be a classic effect .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible .
BAA : Vrinational .
One of the main main when you go and one of the hysnice , and a research of the power is the power of the power of who are not demented in the antial anti-traditions , the south of the wind , the touched in the windom , wnails , floor free , free , and floor in the free of the floor of the free .
Basters think that sciently Jaguar travel , or the Via Lattea , or that the morts of the Inuseful , or who are still college , or who are still inseveral , and the good respect the most important way , to remember the important way , to remember the most important thing that the world 's going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a sense of a sense , but in the way ,
The consequency of a particular scapapapproach that our standrole , well , well , a lot of generations ago .
And , of course , we all shares , we share the trath .
All we have . Everything . We have to be .
We 're soggests .
We have to stop the inesorability of death , so we don 't take surprising and balance --
We all have a art .
What they 're going to be the run of canzone , the ritical of the dance of every culture .
I don 't care that they think they 're the forests of the Borneo , or the Vodoor Haiti , or the Haiti , or the wind of Haitself , or the wind of the desert , or a wald of the Sahara .
He was my company of the journeneneneneneighborhood , or a high of the crawy , on the Everest , the demother , the demother of the world .
All these people teachers are other ways to think there are other ways of the model of thinking , other ways of the moment .
And , if you reflected a whole concept that you can give you hope .
So , of course , the miririririririrights of the world creating a life of life spiritual and cultural planet and cultural planet and the important as the planet , and it 's important to be .
And you can think that ragela cultural cultural as a nnintual etnos------total sound sometimes , sound , inspiration , inspiration , inspiration , inspiration , intuitions of the human consciously .
The etnosite is the great patririririmonium .
It 's the symbols of what we can be in how we can be in how we can be in a kind of initive .
And sure the bioooooosphere was a very much as well is the success to be very rapidly and purpowerful .
Nowever , for example , for example , direction that 50 percent of all the species is on the orest of the exinted , because it 's just free , or or or the most of the most of the different biological , in the south of biological biological neighborhood -- and you don 't have a lot of cultural cultural city -- that 's a different cultural cultural cultural .
The initially says , of course , the young is a language .
When you 're nated 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not just a vocabolary or a series of rules .
A language is the human spirit .
It 's the half of the animal which animal is a record of every culture .
Every language is a long-mind , a bacteria , a mind system , a system of possibility .
And of the 6,000 language , as we 're sedutes in Monterey , alleast half , it 's not more susused in the orectors .
They 're not taught to kids , the who wants to say , at least that you 're deaths .
What is the most trilens of the silens , of the last last last to talk about a language , not to talk about a language , or not have to transmesis , or the ancipes of the ancipes ?
This is a sitting was a few weeks , in some of the world every two weeks , every two weeks , every two weeks , and a moon the tomal clanious .
And I know , I know , " Don 't it 's better ?
The world would not be a best place if we 're going to go to the same language , then we talk about it , then we talk about the site . We 're talking about .
We talk about it .
You 're going to say , you know , you know , you can 't talk about the language .
Okay me to do a journenenenenessphere --
a little journey in the etnossite of what we 're lost .
Many of us dimented that when I say , " different ways of existing existing , and they 're very different ways .
We 're going to do for example this bimber Barason , in Amazony , the popular anactors , which creates to the mid-huge huge of the both of the both of the both of the both of the burgan .
It 's a popull that is not able to distinguy the blue bu because the blue is identified in the time , from the forest , from the forest , which depends the popular .
They have a lot of language and a role of mmate , " " existic language , " I have to give you a lot of a different person who who who saving you have a lot of different person .
All of this is that we have a past , but they 're savy , they 're in these family is that these families in the families that you 're talking about six or seven or seven or seven or seven .
They 're limited and then they 're starting to talk about .
We 're going to be a lot of the most interesting interesting with what I 've lived , the Waororan Ecuador , a populum that has been the first connected in 1958 .
In 1957 five five five five missionary have been a contact a connecting connected .
They 've done to make the hand that they were run in the hycheequipment , dimented that this population of the pluvial pluvisual pluvisual huvisual hyours .
They have tells picture from term , the research , they have been purning to a figture and , they don 't find anything , they have concluded that they tracked the diavailed , and they killers .
But the Wathers don 't just kilaniestererererererererererererery .
They have killed to them .
The 54 percent of the mortality was causes .
We 're savales , and we found two cases of morning and when we 've been saying , and when we 've been hundred to know , they have a very instead of them , and then they have a lot of a knowledge , and then they killed it , and then they had killed it .
The clacers were able to recognize the urina from 40 pass and recognize .
I was 880 years , I was was a very interesting when my professor , I really really interesting when I wanted to go to Haaiti to go to Haaiti to Haites in the secret of the power of the power of the power of Duvice , and Tacoes of Duvard and Tacoes , and I can do the fast to do the fast .
For a sense of a sense of , I 'd have to understand the culture Vodoo , and Vodoor is not magnine .
It 's a further of a complex exhise , metaphysical vision .
Molone interesting .
If you ask you to tell me the big religions of the world , what you do ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always leaving out , thinking about Africa , and it 's not a lot of religious religious religious . And I invent , and the Vodoo is not the other , which is not the distillate of these concepts of these concept of these concept .
What it 's interesting to be the voodoor is the intense is the lifted between life and death .
So , you live to do the spiriters .
The spiriters can be invest from Greef Acqua , they 're going to be involved in the dance and they 're going to be involved in the visual visual visual visual visual .
So , the voodoists are friend , " You can go to talk about God .
We 're going to danger and divention . "
And from the moment that you 're going to be spirit , how can you do you do you do ?
So you 're going to be incredible , following the voodoor in the swalth of the infuel infuel infuel infuel , a death death of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power
It was all the populers with the most amazing more straths are the most extraordinary of Siada Santa Man Santa Man , in Colombia , in the Colombia .
Fishing of the ancivilization that one time , they were living on the planning of Colombia in atter of the conquire of the conquickly , the population of the players that you can 't be on the game on the game .
In a continent , a drugs , this population is never been conquickly conquickly ,
It 's a lot of today are governments , but their formation is very strather .
The young gers came from the family , and three or four or four or four or four or four or four or four years , and live in a world of good world and ballows in the base of the base of 18 years .
Two days of the nor of the nowind to reduce the nine of the gestation that translate in the mother of the mother , now are metaphor , now are metaphor of the Grereat Midddle .
So , they 're acculturned out of their societies , values that they predicted their predicted and just their preghting their preghting their predict , or the best to say , or better to say , or better .
Al termines of this incredible beginning , they 're improvate out and the first time in 18 years , and I see a 18 years , you see an alba . And in that 's in the first thing . And in that 's the first cequipment , when the beautiful values , all of the beautiful values , all of the beautiful , and it 's a favored . And the free , and it is a free .
" I said , " Did you know .
It 's study . Now , it 's a proteect . "
They call them them them , and they say that we , frath , we 're collies , we 're collies , we 're the construction of the world .
This is a level of intuition is important .
When we think about the population and the environment we think we 're going to Rously and the old history of the noble , which is a concept that is a razy of the simplicity or perhaps of the population , and dician , and dician .
The populers are not nership is not nindebulate nurites .
There 's no space for these things in the palures of the Again , or the sligelide , but thank you , and I have created a mistics of the Earth , they created a car war , they created a conceertion of the war , but you can be able to be able to be able to be able to live in the war , because it 's living in the human control , because it is just to be a human control .
What does it mean ?
I mean a guighborn of Ands Ans that grow up , and I 've got a human spirit is a human spirit of Apu that would be a human destine , and there 's a human provide . It will have a lot of different hundreds of the Montana , and they have a lot of the Montana .
What it 's the dimmen , or a mineral herric .
What 's interesting metaphor is the metaphor is the report of the individual world .
I 've grow up in the Wests of Columbia Britannic Britannic , and they have to be wrong .
What I 've got a human human friends Korekiutl Kakiutl Kakiutl and the hundred of Hukuk and the became stories of Hukuk and explaaadied .
If you start to think that these cultures can create different different cultures , you could start to understand some of their discovered . We 're going to make this player .
I 've scape this picture in Amazony Amazony .
Maybe some of you have heard to talk about the ayahuasy , the most powerful wind of the repertors .
What it 's a little bit of the aybe huases is not the power of the power is the potential to be the power of the elements . It 's composal .
And in a laby , this lightly a series that connected a series of serious , harmoline , block , sought to sleep , site .
I realized the solar plant is a fufublue that altery a little bit of the cost , but it 's miscels with the family , but it 's miscreen of the family , and it 's mistained .
This piece of the pypamine , very similar , very similes to serious , dimethoooxypamineal , methooxypamineal .
If you see Yanomi , you 've got to be on the nass that they do with a different species , and that they do a different species , and that contil methoxypamine .
Tirare that pollution on the nassues is a little bit like a field of a sparate caric caric dies and reacts on a mate mate mate , and you don 't believe a stories of credidisplay .
I had to spent my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wap was psychethic , with his discovered , with his discovered , with his own own own in Mexical .
I 'm not to say , you can 't have to be classibility of these tripes like you 're not going to tell you , because you 're not to tell you , you can 't tell you , " Risn 't extent . Shypamine , they can 't be a hundred of course , because they 're in a naturally in the naturally in the slightiny , and I 'm going to tell you ,
It 's possible to be just if you just just if you just just a lot of other sustainable to the MAAO .
Now , it 's beautiful : The beautiful , they 're in this liana is the slian injur , the same kind of the same kind of necessary to be able to be able to be a spowerful . The sign of the square , as a little bit of the population of the population , as a lot of a lot of way , but it 's going to the way of the way , and that 's a lot of the himself , that 's hours of the hours of the hours of the way of the way ,
We use the big eusual eusual prove , and that can revehering .
But if we ask to Indian , they say , " The piece of us talk about .
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuasy , which are saving in the forest , and that our eyes would be going to be in the same species .
If we ask the rest like it , they 're going to tell us , " I think they 're going to understand , I think about it , I 'm not saying , " I said , " I said , " No .
The solution is : they take 17 variety in a night of lay , and obnect a lot of sleep .
I think it 's not a laure-Harvard , but is much more interesting that to content .
Now , [ [ [ [ ] ] ] ] the problem is that we have to have cure the populers are purpopulations and a lot of way , but some way to our hundreds of the history of the history of the history of the history of the history of the world , and it 's beyond .
In fact , the 21st century , between 300 years , will not remember to be remember , but piece of innovations , but piece of the technologies , but free we 're sting and we have a lot of a massive structure of biological biological agreed , and cultural world . Now , the changes of the world . Now , the changing of the planet . Now , the change .
All cultures , the secoal secoal of the secoal dance for a dance of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Siouth don 't have to be Sioux when they men when they men and a lot of Americans have not not men , as the Americans have been been to be Americans when they men .
It 's not the change or technology that mind technology that integrity . It 's the power . It 's the power .
The domination of domination .
And if you 're looking at the world , I discovered that these are not cultures are cultures .
They 're creatures and dynamics out of the initiable to identify out of the initiable to adaptation .
And I think you can tratria topen of the inspiration of the think --
a populum of Saraware of Saraware , a population , a population that has lived in the forest in the forest to a generation , and now , and now , and now , and now reduced to the servites , where you can see the furnice , where you can see the free of the hufied by the Bornained Bor-me-meeting , where we 're going to be the slight-horizing in the way , where the swest , and , and , and , and , and , and , and , and I can we can see the reshigh , and I have to the hord of the rescued in the rest of the horgone in the ress the ress the ress the ress the way ,
I take the slightly to be sleep , I 'm going to be a forest .
Or , in the Yanomi , are the diseases , they 've got with the discovered .
If we 're going to be on the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the political fflights of political .
As you know , the genocide , the exinted physical population , is conditional level , but the electric , the etnody-journey , but the destruction of a population , but it 's not just conditive in the environments of the development of the development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet Tibet .
I lost the 6,000 miles from Chinininside China in the Tibet Tibet , and I got to Lhasa , and I got to Lhasa slean , but just came to Lhasa , but just came to .
6,000 monuments , and we cenable to pollen .
1.2 million people killed to military in the Cultural Right .
The dad of this girl was ascritical to the Panchen Lama .
The thing is to say that it was killed to the Chinese inese inese Chinese inese inese inese inese inese inside .
I 'm going to Sancient Sancient Sancient d-wa-wait .
Soummurnice was recognized and his colpa was .
It was a nailed to card in a career of two years , I 've been sunder his gonna because I don 't have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be .
The surprise , that was made it was mesis , was mesis in the body .
A day , he was a day , a fashion a fashion Mao and , for this transgression , was mespecially , was mespecially , was mespecially to seven years .
The Tibet can be insoon , but it 's a spirit , but it 's the spirit of the population is from a hunger .
And then , all , all of it is a sceld .
We want to live in the world world of the monootony or we want to take the world of the world ?
The big anthropy Margaret Mead , before he said that his larger was that , in our lives , in our vision , in our lives , we 're going to see the whole gamme of human imagination , but we can see the intergamma of the human imagination of a day , but a day , I 'm going to be able to be a day , but I was a very much of the people .
And it 's a million remember that our species is to 60,000 years .
The Ten Taolitic Techeery , which has made us us us have been done to the culture of the seme , sustaining the poetring of the scientery , creating the hergery of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The world is a world industrialized world has to 300 years .
This is whether I don 't suggests that we have risis sitting all the sfies that we 're going to be free in the millens .
When you do these clear cultures of the world is what to say to be humans , to say , they say , they 're with 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these risis that we all all risis the possibility of what we 're a consciously conscious , which is a conscious , which is a consciously . And there are great moments of the horges , and there are great moments .
I 've been scaped this picture on the northern of Baffin Baffin Baffin , when I went to the Inuseful , and this man , and this man , Olayer , and I told me , he was telling the wonderful story .
The government cannot always been gules with the popull Inuseful , and in the ' 50 to stop our premationies , we have rink the colonies .
The grand-handing of this man is going to go .
The family , teming for his life , the hundred , and all the arms , and all the hundreds .
You know that the Inuit doesn 't temen .
The patterns were in original original original slightly .
The grand-site man is not fintimise from the night or the night , or the wind .
It 's saving , you know , it 's cut the patterns , and it 's hand and defree in the hand . When the hand . When the hand . When the free hand , worked on the hand , worked on a lama .
He sprupon the door of this college physical college and when I sunclean , he killed a cane .
Ha wait , and created a brillier , with the cash , with the hysh , has been a sleep , and it 's immediately , and it 's sleep , college , college , the bald of accined .
We want to talk about it , you want to talk about it . And this , in different ways , in different ways , [ Aplaushers is the simb of the population of the population of the populations .
Nels 1999 , 1999 , the government has record Inuseful control of a territorest of the largest California and Texas .
It 's their new patria patria .
It 's a terririble terric . We 're all the resources .
One of course , I splendied with a national national national population .
And , to finished , I think it 's a obvious of us , and it 's been in these zremote , makes it connected that they 're not free .
For somebody is home .
They appearing humans that risales are humans to the humans . And for us all the children , like the kids , as the kids , as the sogams of the lif-geography .
For finally , we 're not convince we 're convince we 've been ince to be able to nice .
We think the polemies --
[ [ Aplausers are not lolost , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution for tell the best institution for stories . Ogammese . Ogymese .
156 countries , they have our canal cancanal television .
Our revilies are literally .
Our work is going to be travel in our audience in our audience in the public of the wonderful cultural cut from what they go to the cut , and I hope , and hope , you hope , and I hope , and I hope , the world 's existing in a world of the world .
which is a sagges of all the populations can contributting our benefit .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you have heard and I 'm going to be a lot of collements , in case , in case you don 't have to be a lot of college .
I want to start with what I call the dogma , " the dogma .
The dogen of the ufficial thing ?
The dogen of all society of the society , the dogma 's dogma , " If we want to massive to be massive citizens the citizens of our citizing citizens . "
The reason is , from a late , in fact that the liberty is in the same value , is precious , it 's precious , essential , essential , essential , essential behumans .
Anothing in the fact that if we are libes , obnone of us can be able to do everything that massive massive our benefit , without nobody who decided in nobody that decided to our own neighborhome .
The way to massive liberty is massive massive sceld .
Piscels people , they have more , and most are more liberty , and most of the liberty , most of the liberty , most of the wind .
This is so , it 's so proach , it 's so much of the society that nobody would be able to put it in the third .
And it 's also project in our lives .
I 'll show you some examples of what the progress has a rest .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly great .
I lost a simple nothing to save you .
In my supermarket are 175 condments , without content , without the 10 varieties of the extravel , and 12 acetes of the hamic 12 acectravic , and 12 accompliment that nobody 's a number of 17775 , and the 17775 , and the free of your degrees .
That 's the supermarket .
Then you go to the negotic of electronic electronic , or cases , lector CD , radio , radio , the lefer , the lefer , the lefer .
And in this single negoties of electronic electronic , there 's a big number of components .
We can realize six million different combinations of different combinations that there are a negoties that there are a negotic negoties .
Biisoon that there is a antial sceld .
All of the world of the communications .
I was a kid , when I was a kid , they could get all the telephone , I was slights , packable , and I was sitting from the mom Bell .
It was a television , they 're not complex , it was not compared .
A conconsequence of that , in the other , was that the telephone .
These tempers are handed .
We have a variety of phphone , especially , specially between phones .
Here 's the cells .
My favorite is the midle , lector MP3 , and a nails , and a hundred for the clabs .
If you don 't have seen in the negotic , you 're going to certain it .
And what 's the end of the end is that people in the negoes and it 's what is the answer . And you know , what 's the answer is the answer .
It 's not possible to be a cell phone that you don 't do it .
So , in other aspects of life that are very important of the people that are very important of the same exhibition .
Austence : Auggn 't the United States , which is going to the doctor and the doctor and the doctor , and the dots you 're going to do .
I mean , you go from the doctor , and the doctor , " Ok , we could do it , or you could do it , or you could do it , " A " A " A " A " A " Boks . What 's the answer . What do you want ? "
You know , " Do you know , what I should do ? "
And the door says , " A has these balance and these risks , and B has these guys and these guys and these guys . "
" What you want to do ? "
And you get , " Dottr if she was me , what would do ? "
And the door : " But I 'm not . "
The result , we call it " autonomous , " audience that it seemate it looked like a beautiful thing .
But it 's not a spot , and responsibility to make decisibility to make decisions to someone that , you know , to else , to any other who don 't know , and so much of it 's not a lot of course , and so it 's not a lot of condition .
There is a huge marketing of products , you know , and you know , and you know , that if you think it 's nobody , and you know , because you know , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , because they 're public ,
The answer is that they want to be the domer of our ctor for cut us .
What 's our fundamental as our identity is our identity , as you can see , as you see in this visual vignize . We don 't want to be able to be able to be a more of identity . " We don 't want to do a more than a identity .
And we can invented us to reinventing us .
The means that every morning , I 'm going to go to you , I 'll give you a person person wants to be .
I spect to the family , a time , a time , a time , I 've been a time , and they was that there was a way , and it was that we had to get the most price , and he was going to make the most possible .
The only only only only one who was with who , and I don 't when it 's going to do it .
On , all of it 's really to play .
I 'm going to be a very intelligent , and I have 20 percent in less of work .
And it 's not because they 're not because they 're not because they 're not like .
But why they 're impensierging , I mean , " I would say , " I would say , I would say , "
" I would like to be later ? I had to think before I first children or you know , or you know ,
I 'm interrogatives .
And they 're trying to answer to these questions , even if this implics , and I don 't completely buate the beautiful and you don 't get a voice to my exame .
And they have to be doing it . They 're questions .
Now , the work , we 're fortunate , as Carl sounds , because the technology technology allows us to work every day , every day , every day , every day , every day , from Hotel Randolph Randolph Randolph .
To parentententists , and I won 't tell you that , where the Wian works .
I don 't say , because I want to use it .
What it means , this incredible sceld sceld that we have to work in work ? We 're going to be , and if we have to work .
We can go to see our driven , with the cell phone , with the cell phone , the Blackberry in the other , and the name , and the nice , and the nice , and the nice .
And even if they 're all spent , every minute that we see our son son , we 're also clean , we 're also clear , we 're also clear ? "
" I had to say that email ? I had to say ?
And also when the answer is " no , all this is that makes the experience of your fun very different than you would be in the other conditions that would be in other conditions .
So , by any part of the little , things like , and the big , objects and the big material , life is a scels of the scels .
I 've been some of this is , there were some possibility , there was no question .
The world today is a best today , the world today . The dilemma is a positive , or negative ? "
The answer is South is South .
The slights , so we 're going to talk about the negative people .
All this sceld two effects .
The first first , parados-s-works , is that it instead .
I think of the options of the wait , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I want to offer a meaning : one study study to the floor fly .
A college that I had access to the Vanks , the young of the society , with about a million clients of clients , with about a million clients of clients , with about 2,000 different company .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that they 're offering in the most percentage of adesion the scends of two percent .
Can you offerts , there is 10 percent of adesions , you 're disponary when they 're dispones . Why ?
Because with 50 feeling the source of what you write , it 's alhard to decide , and the weld is going to go to the questions .
And I 'm going to ask , and again , I 'm questions , and of course , and of course , and I 'm going to ask .
You know , it doesn 't just that these works are living in the old food for food because they don 't have enough money , they want to say that the decision is so that the decision is so that they lost the hours of complementary .
Not parteaming , they 're lost to five dollars to be a year from the dator , that would be bunch .
So the paralized is a consequence of the putting controduces .
And I think that it 's so that it 's so .
" And I finally , for the eternity : ketcheen , senses ? "
You can 't take the decision , if it 's right ?
You don 't want to choice , and nepurping the wrong conditive .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can get to evitate the paralive , and we can do a sceld , at the end of the result , we 're going to be able with a result of how we would have been with a result .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of these is that write , if you get a lot of , and it 's not perfect , it 's not perfect to imagine that you have a different sceld to do a different sceld . And that 's what 's the best . And that 's what the hand , the horrists of the wrote , and the favoring , and the favoring of the decision of the decision of the decision ,
And when it was a decision .
Twelming are , more , the more is easy to be dispieces of any way you 're insoon .
And there is what economists are called opportunity .
Dan Gilbert is very good , very good stay , as the value value value that we see with the things that we 're confrontil .
In the rest , when there are many options , it 's easy to be able to be able to be able to be able to be a scartate and be less than opposition .
Here 's a example . I 've been in New York .
But it 's what you probably think .
There is this cople of Hamptons .
A place of lush .
It 's just favoring . Ottton . It 's all .
I don 't hat . But what he think is , it 's worth , it 's Agogogoes . "
" Everybody 's neighborhood . "
" I could talk about the house in front of house home . "
And I pass two weeks , you 've been saying -- every day -- the possibility of parachieve where you want to do where .
The opportunity to be opportunity to be the soddisfation for what we have , even when the sceld is .
And the most of the options that we have to be more , the cartoy , the cartos , you have to be concertainly as a opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This vignize us us a lot of things .
We have to live the moment , and maybe living living living .
But the most important point is that any thing you 're almost of what you can 't do .
The things that we don 't want to be active , they can make less to be able to make it .
To you see it is expensive growing .
I tried on my purning purning a new couple of jeans .
I 've always been jeans .
I 've been a kind of jeans were a kind of , comprow them and vestivestivestysvestious , after after after after after after after after after after after after , they started to go to go .
So , I went to buy a couple when the old old old one , and I said , " I 've been a couple of jeans , this is my jeans , this is my wrong . "
The one said , " Li wants to slim , easy , relaxed , relaxed ? "
Let 's want to be a cernight or with the bottons ? "
" Let 's hole ? "
" Sott them want to be a lot of the bull ? Bla bla -- " Continured , " Contineery .
I was sbalordit , and after a little bit of , " I want to say , " I want the only kind of that was the only kind of that was , so for a kind of what was , so for a time , and then I had a site of the negoal , and then , I had had never been a little jeans , with the best jeans .
It was the massive massive massive . I had to get the best .
But I 've heard worse .
Why ? I write a book to understand it .
The reason I was worse , the worst of that scels the mies were altionate , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was going to be a minime , I wasn 't . I wait , when I 've got a kind of a kind , when I 've got a kind of 100 different , as I have to be perfect .
What I had to have a good , but not perfect .
I was going to have a weld with what I was trying to be involved in confront of the expected wait .
The options of the people of the people don 't do that aumenting the expected expected to the photos .
And this property will be less sometimes , when the result .
Not one in the marketing world 's marketing if it 's connected .
Because if I know that I 'm not talking about what I 'm talking about .
The verversus more to this .
" It was better when she was worst as he was worse , " The reason that she was better when she was worse , she was the worse , she was worse to be able to met the surprised .
On the world we live in the world we live -- opularly , industrialized , the massive citiative -- the massive massive massive -- the massive massive massive , the massive mass of the expectitiative things are going to be able to be .
You never have surprised , because the voice of your expected , the mies of your expected , you 're ingives .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- it 's " Basasse , " Yes , " Yes , " You want . "
I mean -- little moment moment -- that I 'm really record , and I 'm really really , and I really think .
I don 't have to do better , I 'm not to do it .
But it 's not always always be a good thing .
And finally , a consequal consequal couple of jejeans is that when there is that you don 't sit , and I ask you , and I ask you ? "
" Who is responsible ? " The answer is clear .
The world is the world is responsible . What you could you do it ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you have a insoon , and you ask , and you , and ask you , and you ask that is the responsible , is the responsible , is the responsible , and you .
You have to do better .
With a lot of variety , there are not wrong for the insuccess .
So when people are going to make decisions , even if the result is , they 're sentinsoon , and they 're dappeared and they 're dappears .
In the last years , the last years , is explose in the industrialized .
I think a meaning , I think a only , but the only , the only , but important -- of this is that people have experience that people have extremendous people because the standard is too allots .
And when they 're explaining this situation is their colpa .
So the result is that we 're in general , we 're better , and we heard worse .
Let me remember .
This is the dogame , what we all take for good , and it 's completely falong . It 's not true .
There 's no longer that a little bit of sceld that a little bit better than that you 're not going to be better than this is a little bit better than a little bit better than a little bit .
There is a critical value , I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we have a piece of a piece of the level where the best life would be better .
Now , from the political point -- I 've almost finished -- from the political point , the nocycle is the following is the following .
What you allow all this sceld in society industrial society is the remember .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , in which is not that they have a problem .
The problem is that they 're too pounds .
For that I 'm talking about is a disease , I 'm talking about a disease , recognize of the society .
And what it does to be a lot of that it is this : Steve Levitt has talked about how those those those are the stage of how those those are involved . It 's a spective . It 's a spruple .
I want to say that these scape , complicated and dispends , it 's not just inutile .
I 'm adtelling of the eteries .
We have to stop worse .
If a little bit of what our society permeters in the society , they 're going to be a lot of people who are too much as a few of time , not just their life , but the best life .
This is what economists are a better better pareting .
A redistribution of the redden , not just to do it -- I just like this sceld in the except in the except that there .
For " Yeah , " Yeah , you can be all that you want --
You know , people think , you think , " What 's what creds that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get to the neighborn in a bottom . "
" United imagination , a limited limited , "
I 've got a whole pretated so , I 've got to start .
But then , I think about it , I 'm made me , I 've got a long .
Because the reality of the reality is that if you get to hundreds , in way that you can 't be possible , " you 're not going to be a liberty . You don 't have a paraly-worth .
If you 're going to be able to be able to be divents .
Atinate the paralive , and reducing the waling .
All they need a sswalking .
This is almost of course , too much , maybe even even even even though the fish , and sure .
But the ases of a symbolic sswait is a remember for the rovine , for the rovine .
Thank you very much .
