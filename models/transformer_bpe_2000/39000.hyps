I showed this year , I showed these slides to demonstrate that the artical calotes , which for almost three million years had the size of 48 years had the size of the 48 percent .
But this subjective gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice .
The articulty calots is , in a sense , the clear heart of the global climate system .
You expannoon winter and you reverse summer .
The next slide is going to be a quick characters of the last 25 years .
The ice lost lost are reported in red .
You see , you see , they stand up up until the blue .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is in the winter , which is the glad .
You can see that the ice ice ice ice , and five years , or more , is like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood , and the blood ,
In 25 years , it 's been so , in 25 years .
This is a problem because the heat is the interest in the ocean land , where there are huge amount of coal coal , where there are huge amount of coal coal , and they transformed into the metrics .
I 'm going to do that totality of global atmospicial warming , that amount of global warming , that amount of global warming , super-in-wards .
In some laghi lay in Alaska , the methane is already bolling on water .
The professored Katey Walter at University of Alaska was recently recently , with a team , and we got a lake up with a team .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Lake 's good . The question is if we 're going to be it .
A reason is that this termal exchange from the northern Greenland from the northern .
This is a glacial river .
The ported had never reached levels .
This is the Kangerlusher river , in the Southwast of Greenland .
If you want to know how the level of the ice of the ice of the ice ice ice ice ice on land , here is where the sea .
These corrups are increasing rapidly .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the biggest block of ice the planet .
The month last month , the scientist month have cleared that the ice of the ice is in negative , and that Antarctarctica , which is particularly rapid islands , and it 's particularly rapid .
That 's six meters of the himsement of the action of the action of the action of the action of the action of the action of the action of the action of the action of the action of the action of the action of the action of the action of the action of the action of the across the action .
Himalayas , the third biggest block , you see new laghi , which is a few years ago were glaciers .
Fify percent of the world population was half of the water from the slightly of the world 's population .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the city of the water of the city .
The downered .
But when it decrease , the same happens to the powerful water .
In California the Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The gets are in crisis .
Pedices , as you read , they 're graves .
The growth of the world leads to a remarkable increases .
The disastern environmental disastern , and without precedental and without previous .
Four times more numerous in the last 30 years , I 'm in the last 30 years , I 'm going to have to previous 75 .
This is a whole thing about all unsustainable .
If you look at it in the historical consequences .
In the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look attention the east of the East Pific , the Americas , the American , the west both , and on both parts of the subcontinent , where there is a radical impoor of the oceans .
Most of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuels .
Oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the most emissions , together at China .
And it was proposed to build many other central carbon .
But we 're seeing to a change of direction .
These are annoullate projects in the last few years and some projects of alternative versus .
Everything is , there 's a politics in our country .
The coal industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year for promoting coal , which is a clean obsiming .
And that image was going to me something --
So , Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion gloss of carbon dioist .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second biggest than scories in America .
It happened around the Natal .
The nature of one of the coal commercial industries was this .
Video : Brosty the carbon is a pleger , you know , happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it grow our economy .
Frosty carbon is more and more published .
It 's good price , adorable , and the workers keep the stunning stunning .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest mineral society is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'm going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alliance for Proteon the Clima has launched two campaiged campaiged two campaiged .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Acore : At COLergy see climate change as a threat , and we 're looking at the business .
So our priority is investing a great amount of money in a effort of a effort of a public public and confused the truth of carbon .
In fact , coal , coal is not .
We think it 's cleaned -- it has a good provide .
So not precooking about climate change .
Let me do that .
Video : Ate : Carbone , you heard about it .
So let 's let us give a turn into a pattern , and how much coal about coal published .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noious , but this is the sound of the technology of coal coal public coal .
The coal consumption is between the main global warming , but the nights technology of coal warming , but the nights technology of clean that you see changes everything .
You have a look at this : this is the hath of clean technology .
Al Gore : Finally , the positive alternative connects to economic question and the national security .
Video : Homvast America is in crisis ; the economy , national security security , climate crisis .
The file that the links all of our dependence on fossil fuels , like coal coal and oil .
But , there 's a new new car , car solution for using it .
Repower America : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work , make sure , make sure , and help us stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that you will solve our problems .
Repower America . Scover more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Comvast : It 's about re-in-in-in-the-handed .
One of the fastest ways to get to the dependence on combustiable that killed our planet .
What 's the future is here . Sun , the future is here . Sun , a new energy network .
What do you do is , in fact , for a bunch of work .
Comvailable : America . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old proverbial African tells say , " If you want to go fast , you go down to the only .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I did an introduce in LHC .
And I promise to return out to advance on how the machine works .
So here I am . And the other time , the other time , there were no LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever -- 27 miles of circustery .
His task is to remember the conditions that were under a billion second , from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
This is just environment .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
We photographed these mini-Big Bang in the relevant .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- it 's 44 meters and it has a diameter of 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions .
The 10 September year we have accesared the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was immense of huge control in the room of control .
It 's a picture of the first of particles that had all the turn of the LHC , coming into collision , of hyberately , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles into the right-up .
In other words , when we saw that the 10 image , we found that the machine worked , which is a great viconic .
I don 't know if that was this to do you more or this , when somebody went on Google and saw that the initial page was this .
That means we have had a cultural impact beyond that scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , I had to these dored right here -- these dored dored dored .
These files are taking 13,000 ampers when the machine works at the power of power .
Now , the technicians between you look at the boys and say , " That 's not true . I 'm too much . "
And they can do it because when they 're very cold , they 're very coold-slights .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a further at the side of space between the stars , these files can bring that corrupon the skills , they can bring that crowd that .
In one of the guntures of the most noveils in LHC , there was a fabrication of fabrication .
So the files are about slightly , and the 13,000 prints , and 13,000 practiced a electric resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnets more fish , and that have moved about 30 centimeters , and that have moved about 30 centimeters .
They 're damaged about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we had to do .
We restined them and address .
Now , they 're going back to their place over the ground .
By the end of march the LHC will be again .
We 'll accened it , and we 're going to get to judgly gie data to judgly , and we continue our adventure to find what the morning is the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents reaccess to science and science and engineering in frontier . It 's easy to confuture .
I think that it 's so hard , the fact of going to go beyond the limitations of things like LHC .
I 'd like to end with words a Ingan scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , imagine , in the defense of the experiments of his puppilar , the puple was Michael Faraday , said , " Nithing is so dangerous for the progress of human mind , which is not myself , which is a dangerous for the ideas , which is not myself that there are not mystery , and that 's not a new worldwide , and that 's not a new worless-confect .
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink when children , from children , you play with the morning .
And while you realize how to reach them , and you get them and move them , and learn about things , and you know , actually thinking and solving problems and sending and spaces .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand most part of the world around us .
So , as information is inspired by the usly-useful interaction with physical objects , and my consulting Pot , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking to ask me , " And if we 're using a computer , instead of having the only cursor of the polar mouse that moves on a desktop of the digital mouse that you moving information with hands on a desktop ,
and we 're going to sistemle our living ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siften is a big computer interactive , as a cookied computer interactive .
In a few words , a Siften is a big computer interactive , as a cookied computer interactive .
You can see them , they can move with your hand , they can see , they 're going to hear and they have a radio and a radio screen and a radio .
But most of them are physical objects , like physical objects , you can just move simply .
The Siftable is a new ecosystems to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physical , the movement of their movement , of other , and as they become more physical , conscious , of the other , of how we move , we can explore new and different styles of interaction .
I 'll start with some simple example .
This Siften is configurated to show if it in a direction , the video is going like this , if you including the other side back .
These interactive riting is conscious of others .
If I do that , they 're interested in what they 're going to be around .
If they 're surrounded , they can see it and they can act a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , they can see it and they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power of the data , for example , " puts a color as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siften configure out as a bright a bright ck of vernice and I can use them to color in that central , where they mix .
and I can use them to color in that central , where they mix .
If we 're too much , we can restop a little bit .
There are also a beautiful possibility to learn , like languages , math and games where people can try to do the fast things , and see the results immediately .
Now , I 'm --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a equations .
Here we have a word game in the middle of words and Boggle .
Basically , every turn , you get a letter to every Siftable , Pratically , every turn out to every Siften , you get a letter to every Siftable , and while you 're trying to understand words control about a direction .
Then , after about 30 seconds , they remised , and you have a new set of letters and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came up with the Media Lab , I did so that they tried them and I did a video video .
They are very much .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people many education .
You 've got to say , " Compones of words , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's other people who are trying to it .
This is our own younger header , on the right .
It was actually just going to impact them .
They were only in the morning , for him .
Now , this is a cardboard application .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning languages .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Siftable , they 're just going to be associated .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Siftable , they 're just going to be associated .
So it 's doing out .
Video : The sunger is .
David Merrill : Now he took a tractor in the scene .
Video : The arange tractor .
Boy ! Yeah ! Yes !
So I school , I school , Siftable and put them close to interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
and by inventing their story .
Video : Hao !
DM : It 's a story with a final story , and it can decide him how it became .
DM : It 's a story with a final story , and it can decide him how it became .
Video : Volundly , cat .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you a tool , is a recent tool , to walk and exectly the payer of music and execececuts .
It 's a tool , realized of realized , to willing and execececture music .
Siftable here , and the base , and the bacteria .
Everybody has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also inside these sounds in a sequence to you to understand your floor .
And it 's just to touch a " and a " sequence . "
These are actually actually that you can control from the alive , like the reverbs and the filter .
And it 's a particular sound , and then including it up to faired it .
And then there are the effects like time and fly , which is applied to the whole sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : Do we 'll start putting a base in two Siftable " sequence , " we 're going to put it into a series , we add other base .
Now I put a bottom line .
Video : Do you add to percussions --
Video : And I 'll put the filter on the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the alive .
Video : DM : I can fall the entire sequence inclinking the entire sequence by one side or the other .
Video : And I 'm going to add the filter to the founder at the low to get more expression .
Video : Do I can recombine the flight .
So I don 't have to planning it first , but I can improvising it , and it 's more short .
And now , finally , I can leave the whole sequence inclinking to the left Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new interface men and more like the machine work more like how our brain work .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this pattern , and also a few possibilities that we 're trying to bring out from the lab .
The concept I want to transmitted is that 's coming up this new generation of projected objects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writing written .
I 'm going to write books is my profession , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also love and the fascinating of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , that , something particular happened in my life and in my life , and in my charrieer , who took me to recover the entire recently , I 'm going to recover the whole job .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called " Manogy , Prega , Ama , " which , diversity , diversity from my previous books , for some reason in the world and became a big sensational , and bestyle , and bestseller interational .
And the result is that everywhere . I 'm going to go , people in the way if I was convicted .
It 's true -- convicted , convicted , convicted .
They 're going to me now , and they 're telling me , " You don 't fear more than we could do better ?
You don 't fear to keep write for all life without being able to create a book that can make a book that can do someone ?
What does someone ?
It 's reverse , you know .
But it could go worse , part of the most than 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a telling adolescent adolescent -- I wanted to be a written .
I met the same reaction based on the same reaction .
And people said , " Don 't themes I won 't do successful ? "
You don 't have the humiliation of the killed rejection ?
You 're not fear of doing this for all life without getting out of it and dying on a moving covering of dying , and die on a couple of dinner with the full of flowing floor of failure ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I 'm fear of all of these things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also argument of many other things that people could not have .
As the algap and other things .
But how about the one I thought and I was going to write what I thought and wondered , is why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone who has to be spaper by a job that 's born to do .
But what 's so special in the creative creative impress to make nervous about health health and other people don 't do ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he had fear to be engineer ?
It was never -- that block of the John engineer John , how ?
Don 't work like this , you know ?
Onestery , chemicals as a group don 't certainly , in the centuries , the reputation of being handed hands .
We have enough that we have enough this reputation , and not only the creative involved , but creative of every gender , we have this reputation of being enormously unstable mentally .
And I don 't think about looking at the sad of the magnificent death of the magnificent death , only in the 20th century , they died young and often for them .
And the ones that they don 't suicipate data seems to be actually disfaced by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before I die , in the last interview said , " Every , my book killed me a little more " . " A extraordinary affirmation about work .
But we don 't beat the time , we feel that we heard these things because we 've heard these things that we have completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way , and you know , that art , at the end , it will be hard to the ancient .
And the question I want to get to everybody today is : you agree with this idea ?
It 's good about this thing -- because he also looks at a centimeter distance to me not good about this suppose .
I think it 's hatred .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated century .
I think it 's better encouraging our big creative minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start at the end of the surrounded pursuit , most surroundary circumstances in my career .
That 's what you 're looking at , I 'm pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four decades decades in me .
And it 's very likely that whatever I write about now , and it 's going to be jobs the world as the work that was going to my last book .
I 'm slavery , because we are all about the friends here -- is likely that my biggest success is my biggest mies .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking leads a person to start behind a person starting to drinking a person in the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would rather continue to do this job that I love .
So , the question is , how do you do that ?
And so it seems , after many reflections , that the way to work to write is to write is to create a psychological costrained , OK ?
I have to find a security of security between me , which I 'm written , and my natural anxiety that I 'm written about which is going to be able to get . And , as I was trying to do this last year , looking through the time , trying to find other societies to see if they could have the best ideas to have the best ideas and sane and more sane .
about how to help people create creative people to manage inherent inerent the emotional emotional inherent .
And that research has taken me to the ancient Grecia and Rome .
Semitem because it turns out to circle and then the back .
In the ancient Grecia and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity was giving from men , OK ?
And it was thinking that the creativity was this spirit of bears , and that was sources from a few sources and discovered , for the distant and unknown .
The Geeeeat called these spirits of creativity , " demons . "
Socrate , wonderfully , he believed to have a demon demon the side wisdom .
The Romans were the same idea , but they called that spirit of the spirit of a genius .
That 's great , because Romanished thought that a genius was not really a genius was a little smart .
They think a genius was a genius of entity that created living in the walls of the studio of a divested , a little bit like the Dobby , and that was out of the Dobby , and that was out of the job of that job and pattern the outcome of that job .
Exction -- here 's the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological costraints that you protect you from the results of your work .
And everybody knew that was that it worked , right ?
So , the anti-protected artists were protected by certain things , like the too narcial , right ?
If your job was exceptional , you could not take all the good-up , everybody knew that was helped by this genius .
If your failure job work , it wasn 't all your failure , right ?
They all knew that was your genius to be a hunable .
And so people han conceived creativity in the West for a long time .
Then Renaised the Renaised it and this big idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe over the universe , over the universe of the universe over the universe , and more leaving space to the mitic creatures that they write by divinity .
This was the rational of humanity and people started thinking that creativity was completely by the ished ished idividend up with ished idividull .
And for the first time in history , I started to refer this or that artist as a genius as a rather than one person .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think that allow someone , a simple person to believe as a recipient as a recipient as the source , the essence and the source of all the divines , and ethernal responsibility and a humans is a very large , and a humans is a very large , to humans .
It 's like to ask someone to stage the sun .
It makes all these things that are the ego and creates all these things about aspectable aspectable .
And I think it was this to have this pressure to have artists in the past 500 years .
And , if that 's true , and I think that is , the question is , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of humans and mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't sell 500 years of thinking in a talk in a 18 minutes .
And there is probably people between the audience that would sollevered to scientific subjects , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , they 're going to do it .
I 'm probably not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I 'd like to get is -- why not ?
Why not think that way ?
Because it has more sense of everything that has ever heard to explain the exaspermany imprevealing the exaspering imprevealing the process .
A process that , as anyone who has ever taken to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- you know , not knows , you know , you know , not buy rationally .
And in fact , it can sometimes it seems to look like a whole paranormal .
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poetesse Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but that was a poetesse for all life and told me that during his childhood in the Virginia , worked out out in the fields , and he was hearing out in the fields , and he was hearing out in the fields , and he was in the fields .
He said that she was like a fragorous , he was like a fragorous ,
And that was rotles up to her from the landscape .
He felt to come , because he was tremendous to the land under his feet .
He knew you had one thing to do at that point and it was , words like a matters . "
And so he running back home and sent from this poetry , and it wouldn 't have to make a piece of paper and a math enough cut and a match , and he would take it and slaughter , and he slamp it on the page .
Sometimes he couldn 't be fast enough , so he was sorting and run walking without getting into the house and and the pothetic pory , and she would keep it up through the landscape , and he would keep up through the landscape , and he would keep up through the lessing , and he said , " one other poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece I 'm going to forget -- there were moments where the moments was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running house and she was trying to paper and the poem was going through , and he was going through , and he was a match just in the while he was going , and then he said , " He was as a sleep with the other hand and the coule .
He was going to the poem from the tail and reput it in his body and transply-page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page , and the last word , on the last word at the first .
So , when I felt that I thought -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly equal to my creative process .
I 'm not a creative process -- I 'm not a condition !
I 'm a mulo , and my way to work is ; wake up , wake up at the same horary every day and saying and work and go over and pass on it .
But even I , in my heads , I 've stripped against that thing , sometimes .
And I think that even many of you , many of you , you know ,
You know , even if the job and ideas were given me by a certain source , I could not , I could know .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we make it to make it not losing the head , but , rather , rather , which is , you know , how do you remains healthy ?
As I think about it , the best example , the best contemporary example I have is Tom Waits , which I interviewed a different day years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of the arten recontemporary artist , trying to control , gesting , and to control , dominate these kind of creative impulses .
But then I invent , he got up , and one day as he was driving on a driving car in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going to fast fast and all of a swap , and it 's a huge of the map , which is inspiration , and it wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and it wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and it 's not how to take it .
It doesn 't have a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a math , it doesn 't have a cler .
So it starts to feel this kind of old anxiety in him , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to lose this song , and I 'll reverse from this song .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , they stop .
And I 'm going to do the whole mental process and made something new .
He just looked at the sky and said , " Don 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" You know , " Hi , " Do you know , " Do you know ?
If you really want to be back , back in a more opported when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you go to important anything today .
You know , you know , Leonard Cohen . "
And his work process , he changed after this .
I don 't work , the job was still known as always .
But the process , and the fish that was that attended the genius was releft when the genius , the genius , the genius out of him that problems and liberated it back from where it was , and made from that , and made it was made from , and made that it didn 't have to be an interized , and gathered .
but it was very well , beautiful bizarre , beautiful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange thing and external thing that was not Tom .
So how much the story I started changing a little bit even that story that I was worked in and I was saved once .
This idea , I was going to write when I was written , " Manogy , " Ama , " and the falls in one of those cave disperation where we all work on something and we can 't start thinking that and we can 't start thinking that it 's going to be the worst , which is going to be the worst book .
Not just the worst book , just the worst book .
And I started thinking about gectacking this project .
But then I remember Tom that was talking about air and I tried to it .
So you get my face on the hand , I found my commments to a empty corner .
And I said high voices , " What , what do we know if this book isn 't be brilliant not going to be interaction , right ?
Because as you see , I 'm putting all I have , I don 't have that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to present you and make your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my job .
And I 'd like to make my part of the world that I 've been shown for me today , " Why -- finally , is that 's so , OK -- secovers ago in North Africa 's deserts for the key to the clear of the middames , and music that they were going on for hours and hours .
And they were always magnificent , because the ballerins were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every once , something happened , and one of these artists was actually transply-to-the-the-to-.
And I know what I 'm talking about , because I know you all seen , at a certain point , a performance .
It was like the time stopped , and the dance ballery , and he wasn 't doing anything different from the usually , like 1,000 nights before , but it 's very slide .
And suddenly not appeared as a human .
But you accen from the divinside and the fire in the fire of divinity .
And when this was going to the time , people knew what was , they call it with her name .
They knew hands and started to cantar , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God . "
That 's God , you know .
Curious known historical -- when Mororororical south , took this abitude with them and the pronoundins changed by " Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , " , " and " Ols , " which , " which is still you can hear in the round or in the floor .
In Spain , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , " Allah , role , " Allah , magic , " Buh , " I 'm going to understand God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But the problem comes the day , and the dance is the dancerin the dance , when you wake up and discover that 's 11 in Marteden 's on the morning of Martedries and God doesn 't have .
It 's simply a mortal with bad bad for ginoccurred , and maybe it will never get to that altitude .
And maybe none will be the name of God still goes out , and what has to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful recognition to make in a creative life .
But perhaps not have to be so angoscious if you can 't believe , initive , lunch , which the most extraordinary aspects of your being being from you 're from yourself .
But you just believe that you have a data that is a prested by a further unimaginable source of this squisite of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think this is all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly as I thought for several months in the worker , I 'm going to do soon , the dangerous , I 'm going to go on my great success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electric , I feel electric .
Don 't go . It 's only your job .
He 's got to introduced , whatever it is .
If your job work is dancing , bought .
If the divine , lisurd genius to leave up decide to let a few kind of wonder , for one moment through your effort , then , " You know ! "
You 're going to do the same yourself .
And " Ole ! " Her the same .
I think that I think , and I think it has to teach it .
" Yes ! " at yourself , even for having loved human lovely and tons to make you keep to introduce you to keep up .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I 've talked about some of these projects on human genome , what meaning and discovery new genes .
Now we 're starting a new new path : we started to digitalize biology and now from that digital code we 're going into a new phase of biology , design and synthesizing life .
We 've always tried to get big questions .
" What is life ? " is something that many biologists , I think they 've been able to understand and livels .
We tried different approaches , reduced it to minimal terms .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was going to go from the analogical world of biology in the digital world .
Now we 're asking : We can regenerate life , or create new from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from genitalium that can autoreum in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create one more smaller .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of the about 500 of the way I 'm here .
But when we take a look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple respond to our map .
I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at a time , is very unlikely that this can bring a living cell a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to make this such a suit was synthesize this crop so that we could have modify to components to bring some of these things things .
And so we started the adventure of " Can we synthesize a cropmosome ? "
Can chemistry connection to produce these big molecules that we never never had to create before ?
And , in case , can we have a crubber , can we make a cromosome ?
A cromosome is simply a chemistry of material inert .
The speed that we 're able to digitalize life is growing up is exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , rather proud , rather , but it 's improve .
And our most recent results the branching on a exponential curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process required by many pass , starting with a bioethical review before we started the first experiments .
But we found that synthesize that DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that produces small of DNA , the letter of 30 to 50 letters and it 's a degenerative process : the longer segment is , more errors .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these broilers and run the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , starting to go from the Phi X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills kills .
We designed the fragments , actually , you know , the correction of errors and got a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemistry material inert , and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and produced the viral particles .
The viral particles were releft by the cells , they 're back back and destroke the E. coli .
I 've talked about recently with membranes of oil industry and said that they have certainly compress this model .
They remember more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually actually build its own own own own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things bigger .
We wanted to build the whole cromosome of the bacteria .
I 'm more than 580 miles letters of genetic code .
So we thought we 'd build it in a seven of the virus of the virus , so that we can change the casses for the living of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard standard was a every 10 miles .
We found , reduces that , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence , we would never be able to do it work .
One part of the process is to design segments that are subsigments that are overraping with all the other segments of 50 letters to build subunits work together .
We try to give one one one one of them here .
You probably have a bed thing that we put on the filit of the file .
Think of that we have a genetic code based on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those readers men together codify about 20 minoacids , and there is a specifically order to every minoacids of letters .
So we can use genetic code to write words , frageasy , thoughts .
What we did in the beginning was autograped to do .
Some have been used by the fact that it wasn 't poetry .
We designed these segments to just just joined these things to be able to join .
There are enzymes that repair them and put them up .
And we started assembly assembly , starting with segments from five to segments , and then you know , to segments of 24 miles reading a letter to them to get to 72 to them .
And we made these segments in abundance , so we 've produced these sequence that we 're trying to create a very robstood process -- as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatizing the process .
So , this looks like the tabellon a basket .
When we get these very long segments , more than 100 miles , more 100 miles , they 're not going to grow more directly in the E. coli .
You go to the limit of modern modern biology .
So we looked at other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination , which is in biology , which is in biology to repair DNA can bring the DNA can bring the segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , it can absorbed three million rads .
You can see in the super-high super-destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can sit .
They can live under empty .
They 're absolutely certain that life exist in space , and you move to find new environments of water .
Actually , NASA has shown that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built these processes , simply using the lethrew lights with the segments of the segments to put .
The leaved listen to them automatically .
This image was not taken with a microscope , but with a regular microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It 's a big molecule that we can see it with a law microscope .
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publish we did a little time ago .
They 're more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the biggest molecule of a defined structure .
It has a molecular weight in 300 million .
If we stamp with a 10 without spaces , you would like 142 pages , they would just take to transmit this gene code .
Now , how do we work this ? How can we activity ?
Of course , you know , a virus is a guys .
It 's a little more complicated when they use .
It 's also simpler when it comes to eucariote as our : you can just extractly , and you can just extractly the clonation and put another , which is basically the clonation process .
In the bacterium archaea is integrated instead of integrated inside the cell , but we have recently demonstrated that we are able to make a transplant transplant of a cell of a cell of a cell of a bunch of a cell of a cell of a cell of a cell , but we have recently deed that we 're able to do a cell
We could have a cromosome with a microbial species .
The two are different as men from men .
We have added some gene in a little bit that I could decide that I choose for this chromosome .
And then he skied her slammed with enzymes .
And when we put it into the cell was stupendent -- and you appreciate our sophisticatos -- the new cromosome , the new cell .
And we thought we were that we couldn 't go beyond , but we 've tried anyway .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that many species have added species have added a third or a third romosome , add in a thousands of new tracks to that species .
So who think evolution as only gene , as a only gene , and it doesn 't understand most of the biology .
There are a lot of enzymes called restriition , " which is the DNA . "
The chromosome that was in the cell doesn 't have one .
The cell phone that we have inseritous to have to do it .
It 's expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome , and he was cemasticated , and we found us with only the cell and the new cell cell and the new cell cell .
It has become blue because of the genes we put .
And in a short , in a short time , all the characteristics of a species , and it turned out of all the software , and we 've got into the new software that we put in the cell .
All proteins are changed , and when we read the Evaced , and when we read the equivalent of what we 've been transfer to what we 've been transfer .
Now , this may seem alchemy genetics , but we 're going to get the software in a way of substantial things .
Now , I 've been explained that here not talks about genesis -- but progress starting to three million years and evolution , and I 've said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of this .
Why do that ?
I think that 's obvious enough when we think about our need .
We 're going to spend six billion people at nine billion in the next 40 years .
Right for example : I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 , there will be four .
We 're going to have problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicinal gas , and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more hard for nine billion .
We use more than five billion coal , more than 30 billion bets .
That means percent million bards a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or whatever kind of process to reduce them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole emission of CO2 from these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
At day , because of the scientific discoveries around the world , we have a databasasases with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they are designed for the future .
The electric industry only only has a dozen about components , and think about how many different things were coming out .
Our limitations here is very biological data , and our imagination .
Now we have the techniques , because of these rapids of synthetization , that we call combatory combatory genomics combatory .
We 're able to build a big robot that can make a million cromosome of cromosome day .
Think of these 20 million genes or to prove to optimize these kinds of different processes to make eight-eight or drugs , new vaccines , and we can change , because a small team , and create more biology , and create more biology now that in the last 20 years of science science .
And it 's simply a standard standard .
We can choose for a chance of survival , production , chemicals or or fuel , producing vaccines .
This is an instantanished of some software programmed on that we 're working on for being able to sit and design species to the computer .
Well , we don 't know , we know how they will be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
Now we 're focused on the fourth generation of fourth generation .
You also saw you that experiment with the grant was a bad finished experiment .
We have fuel in second-generation and third generation that will be surroundle of the higher value , like eighth of the higher value , or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way biology can have a big impact without increases the cost of food and limitares the cost of food and limitars the cost of food , and we 're working on the CO2 in matter , so we 're working on for design cells that can achieve this purpose , and we think we can get this purpose , and we think we can get this purpose , and we think that we can get the first generation in about eight months in about eight months .
The solar light with CO2 is a metodom -- but in our discoveries around the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we have described in 1996 .
It lives in the ocean , about 2500 feet , about 2500 feet of ebollions of water .
They recover , they put out from CO2 using a molecular hydrogen as well .
We 're trying to understand whether we can meaning CO2 , which can easily be transansported by transports , convert that CO2 in fuel , to drive this process .
So , we think that we could be able to increase what we could increase what the basic question of what the basic question is . We have the modth holding -- we have the modth holding industry to reduce the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where can you ?
It would be a main energy .
And also , we 're working on using the same methods to create instantaneous vaccines .
You 've seen this year with influenced , we 're always back in a year , and with a dollar under when it comes to find the vaccine .
I think that that you can change building vaccines in a fighting .
That 's how the future could start seem to seem changing , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating the synthetic evolution with synthetic bacteria .
We 're so from the best people .
Our purpose is to be enough to live long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'll show you , the most quickly possible , some fundamental job , some fundamental work , which is a year ago exactly . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
It 's a very environment where you can interact is at the local level that remote with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of gabytes of photos with a kind of zoom stant photos , and a continuous fast , for a panoramic gabytes , we want to .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these are the amount of data or images or the images of data or images .
Most of the most are common digital photographs , but this is a vast scanning from the Bilibrary of Congress , and refer into the 300 megapixel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any moment . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , example of no data .
This is Dickens , Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
To show you that it 's about text and not images , we can do something like that , to really make a kind of thing , to make a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a book .
I don 't consider it .
This is a more realistic example . This is a number of The Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading version of a magazine , or a neightidian , which is for nature a lot of a half .
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of The Guardian .
We created a fasulla advertising -- much more than what you use in a normal advertising -- and we put in a normal advertising -- and we put you in the extra content .
If you want to see the characteristic of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other other other models , or even the specific specific techniques .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limitations of space on the screen .
We hope that means to put up the pop-up , and other porks like that , you don 't need to be more .
Of course , the mapping is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this isn 't want to lose time , if not to say that we have contributes to get in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , the NASA geospaces of NASA .
So now we 're going to see at something else .
This is now , in fact , from the Web ; you can go to the Web ; you can see it .
This is a project called Photosynthree-several technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research a very interesting research at Noah Snavority , a student of Washington of Washington of the UW and Rick Steve Steve Steve , " a great collaboration . "
And it 's from Seb , gestion the Web , gested by Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one image to the other image and have this kind of experience to multiple and have this kind of experience .
But the space of the images of the images here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization of computers have registered these images together , so that they correspond to the recorded place in the Roccis-based moving nearly the Lagne Roccised canader . So , you 're going to see elements of a slide-stable show . So , here 's a slide-stable show , and these things were all space space .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to go to one of the original data of Noaholding data -- and this is from a previous prototype of Photosynth-scored Photosynthrow -- to show you what I think is the key behind this technology , Photosynth-scores . And it 's not necessarily , we 're looking at the environments that we put in the website .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Notre of Dame images from Flickr . Basta digitar Notre . Basta digitar , and you get images of the kinds of magicians in magicions , and so on . On of these arancions , and so on . Obody of these arancions represents a picture that is discovered to this model .
So they 're all pictures taken by Flickr , and they were all connected to this way .
And it 's possible to have a way simple .
You know , I would never have thought I 'd end up working on Microsoft .
It 's very gratification to receive this kind of accounts here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different types of different kinds of photowns : from those of the phones to the SLR LR LR , a meaning , maker number , must set together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try those strange most .
Many block , etc .
Somewhere there is a lot of photographs -- here it 's a series of photographs -- here .
This is a Notre poster Dame recorrectly .
We can move from the poster vision of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the entire memory of how the land , from a visual memory of how the land , from visual vision -- and connects all of these data together .
All those pictures become connected , more than the parts .
You have a model of the entire that emerges .
Think about this as a Stephen Lawler 's work on Earth 's work .
It 's something that grows in complexity as a people who do it , and the advantages for who are using the use of people .
Their picture are taking with other people .
If someone is the idea of contraction all these saying the name , my picture of Notrich catthedral of Notrich catthedral arrment , and I can use it as a kind of entrepreneurs in that space , in that metaphor , in that metaphand , in that metaphers of anyone else , and have a social experience of cross-mobile cross-model , crossmooth .
Of course , one consequence of this is virtual models of every interesting part of the land , and you know , not only gathering from the Earth , you know , you know , not only as open-to-similar images and similar , but from the physatellite images .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software is going to be able to do is that at some point , in the next few years , all the shared world from anyone in the next few years , they 're going to be all together ?
BAA : Yeah . What he 's doing is actually discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And he 's doing it in the basis of the images .
What is really interesting if you think about the wealth of semantic information that 's semantic information that many of these images are possible images .
As you get a picture of images on the Web , you 're going to be a sentence and the text on the web page has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what if that picture is to all your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of wealth that was really huge . It 's really huge . It 's a classic classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pals when you travel and one of the delivered of the eth-graphics research is the power of living in who has not forgotten the anti-traditions , the past in , touch it in the piogges , you can drive from the raind plants .
Basti thinking that sciamani Jaguar travel even beyond the Via Lattea , or that the old Inuit 's still colors , or in Himalayas , the buddies still , the buddies are still going to remember the importance of the Dharma , and remember the importance of the Dharm , and that the idea that the world that we live not exist in sense , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of adaptations that our own own own own own own own .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
We all hired . We 're all procrease .
We 're going to be initiation .
We need to deal with death inexorability of death , so we don 't surprising and we get to the dawn .
We all have art .
What hits is the phythm of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they 're the Penan forests of the Borneo , or the following Vooodoo , or the guerriests of the Kaisut , or a cammultiple , or a cammultiple cammmmultiple , or a cammmmultiple in the Saharan 's heart .
He was my journey companion in the desert a month ago , or a yak already , or a yak , on the Everest , the dealing of the world .
All of these populations teaching us that there are other ways of exists of thinking , other ways of modes in the world .
And , if you reflect a second , it 's a concept that you can give you hope .
And together , the world 's cultures of the world , and cultures of the world 's life and cultural life that we have the planet and cultural life that planet and is important for the benefit of the planet as a biological ragela of neighnature .
And you can think about this cultural records like an ethnosphere and you can define ethnosphere , and you can define ethnosphere , the total , machines , ideas , intuitions , intuitions , ideas , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions ,
The ethnosphere is the patrimonic of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in as species .
And because the biosphere was a very consumed by ethnossphere and purely much much more .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species was or is on the horrim of simply because it 's falmost optimistic , or in the horrim -- in the most apocalycket -- and you don 't even get close to the most optimistic diversity --
The index of this is , obviously , the loss of language .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the shraw of human spirit .
It 's the midddle of which the animal of every culture comes in material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a gone , a spiritual chance .
And of those 6,000 languages , while we 're sitting here to Monterey , at least half , it 's not more surrunning in the ears of children .
They 're not teached to children , which means , unless wanting to be willing something , which is already dead .
What is more sad than being the silent , the last few sad , the last few speaking a language , not have way to transmit the wisdom of the wisdom of the promised or ancipy promised to be the promised of children ?
This is a faired of someone in the world every two weeks : every two weeks , every two weeks , a high old muore and brings to the tomba bunch of ancic language .
And I know someone who is going to say , " Isn 't that ?
The world would not be a better place if we 're going to talk all the same language ? " Well , then we talk all yorba . We talk to yorba . We talk cantonese cantonese .
Let 's talk kogs .
You 'll cover a tracks of a tracking thing to say not to talk about language .
I 'd like to do a journey through ethnosphere --
a little journey in ethnosal to give you a little journey of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of existing really different ways of existing . "
So let 's take for example , this Barasana Barasana , in Amazon the settle-a-bony , which creats the middle of the sacross the sacres of the sacres of the sacres of the sacres of the sacres of the sacres of the sacks .
It 's a popular that it 's not able to distinguish the blue color from green because the cell has been identified in the time of forest , which depends the popular popular .
They have a strange language and a matrimonic regulations , called " " " " " " " " " " " " " You have to marry a different person who talks about different language .
And this has radices in the past mitological , but the particular particularity is that in these families that they talk about six or seven languages , no one of the matrimons of mons , no practices .
They 're just going to listen to listen to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waorani of Ecuador , the Waorani Eastern Eastern , a very incredible popular popular that has the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have taken a factor , in fact , in fact ,
They did taken out of the photographs that had been done by a few who had had never seen that this popular popular popular forest that this popular popular forest .
They raise the picture of the land , they turned to the research of a shape or a figure and , not find nothing , they have concluded that it was the displays , and killed the five missionaries with the lights .
But the Waorani didn 't only killed strange ,
They killed with them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We were high eight generations and we found two of death , and we found two of death , and we got to know , they had a huge knowledge of them , and then they killed it the same .
The crazy captures that we can recognize the animal urine from 40 steps and recognize it .
In the early 1980s , I was assigned a very interesting task when I was a huge task , if I wanted to go to Haiti Haiti to enter Haiti me if I wanted to go to Haiti and Tonton Macoutes and Tonton Macoutes and Tonton Macoutes , and impossessed me to make zoombies .
To give a sense of miraculous meaning , I should understand the Vodoun culture and Vodoo is not magic .
It 's pretty much than complex metaphysical vision in the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big religions in the world , what would you say ?
Christianthesietime , Islam , Buddddism .
A continent comes up , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has not have religious field of religious . And instead of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts that we 're going to be slavery .
What makes the voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , you know , they 're going to the spirits .
The spirits can be invited by the Great Acqua , they respond to the dance of dance and replaced temporary soul to the soul of vive , and it 's a little bit the following up to be the following .
So , the voodooists love to say , " You know white , you know , you know , you know ,
We say in the temple and we forget God . "
And from the moment you 're going to be , is the spirit that you can do the bad ?
So you 're going to these incredible events : follow voodoo in state of trance that touch , in the state of the power of mind , and you know , as a very strong power of mind , when it 's catalyed in a state of extreme extreme , exciting .
In all the popular people that I lived the most amazing people are the Kogi of Sierra Nevada de Sierra Nevada de Sierra Nevada , Columbia sectourional sectourional .
Exion ancivilization , who had been living on the characters of Colombic planets in the Colombia in the waiting popular makes on the vulcanic massive planning that you 're on the characters .
In a blood continent , this popular a blood , this population never been conquered by the spaces .
At today , they 're governed by a cler-clery , but their trained traordinary .
The young people follow come from the families to three or four , and they live secreated in a good world , and they live in a good world and homes in a couple of stone of the glaciers for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , I 've been proposed to reproduce the nine months of gestation that spend in the user of the mother , now I 'm metaphorically in the usered Great Mother .
So , that 's all the time , they 're accultured to their society , values that they predicts their predicts and only their predicts and they keep the cost of their own , or to say the balance , or to say the balance .
At terminal , of this incredible initiation , they 're suddenly taken out and for the first time in life , at the age of 18 , they see a high . And in that moment of consciousness , when the sun gone , the valley of the beautiful landscape , everything that they learned in theory is constantly confirms in the spended up , and he does a past back . The precise does a past back , and he says .
" Yes ? I 'm going to do as I said .
It 's amazing . Now it 's to you protect it . "
They call the biggest brothers and say we , brothers , are the colputs of the world 's destruction of the world .
This is intuition is extremely important .
When we think about Ingene populations and the environment , we 're in Rolseau and the old story of the noble selv-vages , which is a razy concept in his simplicity or perhaps , we say that these populations are closer to the Earth of us .
The Ingenious populs are not feeling in the nostalogy .
There is no space for these things in the malaria of the Astops or the vent of Tibet , but because it 's a time and the ritual , they created a mysticks of the Earth , but on a blueprints of the Earth 's known as well as neighbors -- but the concept that the Earth can only live only because it 's consciousness of human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
It 's a guy that a kid of the Ande that the mountain is a couple of Apu who is going to drive his destiny , it will be a different depth , and it 's going to have a different report , and it 's going to different relationship to a Montana . And it 's a different mass of Montana , and it 's a mass of rock , and it 's a mass of rock .
That 's the dimuth of one , or a mineral city is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the report of the report of the individual world .
I grew up in the forests of the British Columbia British Columbia forests for being cut .
And that made me a different human being from my friends Kwakiutl that creding forests are Hukuk 's dimora of Hukuk and the shake of paradise and the spirits that live on the northern world , spirits that affected during the world , spirits that affection during the world , spirits that affection during the beginning the Hukukuk 's beginning to me .
If you start looking at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of them their sensational discoveries . We take this piece of plant discoveries .
I took this picture to open in the nordocted Norortheless .
Mayahuash , some of you have heard about the ayathic repertoilet 's the sciamanic repertoilet 's like the sciamanic repertoilet .
What makes the ayathuasks the ayauhumpauhumpaxurial potential of the substance , but its elements . It 's two two elements .
He has a ball , this lian lake , that contains a series of betacarbolins , harmind and harming , slightly halls .
And by making the only plant , you have a blue smoke that alters a little bit the consciousness , but it 's misceled with the leaves of a family of the Psychotels said .
This plant contains spowerful , very similar to serotonin the serotonin the methoyltryltryltrylthoxyptamine .
If you ever see Yanomami , you 'll see the nose of the nase that they do from a different set of species , anchly anchly methoxyptamine .
Again that polly-a-pound stages , is a little bit like being disappeared by a fire of books and landing up a sea of electricity . It doesn 't creates a distortion of reality .
I often I had often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who took the psychedelic was in the 1930s in Mexico .
And I think , in my tesis not to classified these tripams as because if you 're not telling them to be hallucined . And they can 't tell anybody of being halluckin . And you can 't be horly because they 're money from a halls , because they are in a young , which is , of course , in the intestine monodasure-oxioxes .
It 's possible to absumerely if they just hurting with other chemicals that denaturate MAO .
Now it 's the beautiful : Can dramatic dioothers , which is the MAO of MAO , the same kind of need to potential tripamines . The question is that 's going to be a 80,000 species of plants , how these populations are not , but that if you combine , you know , in this way , create a biochemicles , but that if you combine in this way , create a biochemicles of the somma of parts ?
We use the great eulife-proof and error , which can revealing infruit .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " The plants are talking about . "
What does that mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of the forest , which is that they 're going to give up in the forest , and that our eyes would be going to the same species .
If we ask them how they 're going to make their tasonomy , they 'll tell us , " I thought of plants , you know , you know , not all ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night of the moon and each night with a different .
And that 's not a hua to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that contact stames .
Now , you know , the problem is that even the ones of us who have heart people who are in the ingenes , but in some reduced way you have the margins of history in our real world , and it turns out .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it 's not remember for the wars or its technologies , but rather as the era that was where we were stopped and we used to huburged and activity of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux didn 't stop being Sioux when they put out of the ark and fallen as well as Americans don 't stop being Americans when they put out of Americans and hotels .
It 's not the change or technology that they minger integrity . It 's the power .
The hard flight of the domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you 'll find that these are not cultures that these are not cultures of these are not cultures .
They are creating living and dynamics push out of the identifable identifable identify that go beyond their ability .
Which is that the disboscaring in the Patrit of the Penan --
a popular nomake Sarak , in the Southwest , a popular popular who lived in the forest to a generation , and now reduced to the service and the reduced on the reduction of the reduction of the rivers , where you can see the river from the lights , which looks like the Borneo MCinese Merian , where navels the horizing measure ,
Tah puts the store living with the forest is to forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , is the disease that have come to the discovery of gold .
If we move on the Tibet mountains of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of political domination .
As you know , the genocide , physical extinction of a popular popular , but ethnocise , ethnocise , the destruction of the lifetnocise , is not only conditions , but it 's not only cell , but it 's a celebrate in certain environments , because it 's part of the strategy development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet of Tibet until you 're part of the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in China , in the Western Cina through Tibet , and I realized the Lhasa with a young , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what 's behind the statistics of which we feel about .
6,000 sacres sacres in dust and cends .
1.2 million people killed by military military during the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical to Panchen Lama .
And that means it was killed to the time of the Chinese invasion .
Her uncle is smooth with Sua Santity , which has taken the diaspora in Nepal .
His mother had been impresoned and her colpa was rich .
It was taken to hide in two years , born under the age of two years under her gonna because he could not live without him .
The sister , who did the same , was in the same , was in reeducation .
And one day has been hot on a day coffered a squake , and this transgression , was mesh to the washed works for seven years .
The People of Tibet can be insuit , but the reinside of the population is from the population is holding .
And then , everything is reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the world monothic monothy or we want to accover the world policymatic of diversity ?
The great anthropologia Margaret Mead , before he die was , in our living towards this world , is in our living toward this love of the world , we will see the entire gamma of human imagination , but one day we 'll think , and one day we 'll see it from a swoke up with a sleep forget from a sleeping sonnap , even that there were other possibilities .
And it 's humiliating our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Neolitics Rivolution , who gave us the agriculture , which has made us suck up the cult of the clerarclerarclerarchy , creating the gerarchy of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world 's been 300 years .
That shares not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we 'll have to deal with millenny in the millennia to come .
When these myriad of cultures of the world is asked what it means to be human , they 're responding with 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all all riscover the possibility of being what we are : a kind of knowledge , which has to make all the people and all the people can trusted . And there are great moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the northern of the island of Baffin , when I went to hunt the dawn of the Iuit , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , he telled story of her grandfather .
The canadical government was not always gentleman with the Inuit and in the 1950s for the 1950s to stay our suprematiy , we 've rhink them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man rejected to go .
The family , I 'm afraid for his life , and he took him all the arms , and all of his atticks .
You know that Inuit doesn 't themselves the cold , they 're going to do it .
The pears of the sledge in origin were made of heavy skin the skin .
The grandfather than this man didn 't intimid-up or the library or from the library ,
It 's glackaged out , it 's hot the pantalone in the skin and defected in your hand . When the phecared the hand . When the pheckey I did the became , and it creating a lama lama .
He sprued on the door of this cut , and when it became solid , he became a dog .
He took a dog and created a brid , and he created a blue , and he created another dog , and it 's disappeared on the flap , and it 's disappeared on the flap .
We want to talk about cavarye with nothing ? [ Rism . ] And this , in different ways , [ Apausi is symboll of the Inuit and all the world 's popular symbologists and all the world .
In the canader 1999 government government , gave the canader Inuit , the total control of a bigger area of California and Texas together .
It 's their new patria new bad . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's a Independent territory . They 're constraints .
One beautiful example of how a nation-state could recognize with his popular .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious at least who of us was in these remote zones of the planet , remote that they 're not really remote .
For someone is home .
They represent human fields that they 're going to be in the dinner of the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , as the dreams of our children , become part of the cloud of the hope of hope .
Finally , we have to National Geographic we are convinced that politicians will never get to nothing .
We believe that polemiics --
[ Applauses ] not , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month , our website . Every mothers our website .
156 countries transmit our television canal canal .
Our record is literally millions of people .
Our work is travel in the ethnosphere to bring our audience in a place of wonders , cultural world 's going to be able to get our public , they will go away as much as they saw and hopefully , bring up in the middle of the world , and we have to find a lot of life in a pluralistic world 's life in a pluralistic world and multicultural world
where the wisdom of all the popular wisdom .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope is that I 'm going to reach some of the connections , and I 'll try to evidence some connections , in the notastic .
I 'd like to start with what I call " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " The dogma dogma dogma . "
The dogma official of what ?
The dogma official of all the Western industrial dogma citizens : " If we want to male our citizens . "
The reason is , from a side , in the fact that freedom is in itself a value , is precious , useful , is , useful , essential for humans .
On the other one is that if we 're free , each of us can act for all that we 're going to do everything that massive , our well-being , without any decided in our well-us that decided to our well-us .
The way of massive freedom is massive , it 's chosen .
More people have , more choices , the more is free , and more is their liberty , more is their well-being .
This , I think , is so deeply radicated in society that nobody would drew to doubt .
And it 's also deeply radicated in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not a particular thing .
I 'm a simple note about conditivanished .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contact 10 varieties of oil and 12 acks and the 12 acks , and the balsams that you can buy for you a huge number of condition in the crowd circumstance that no 175 prons is that no one of the 175 cost of your degree .
That 's what supermarket is .
Then you go to the electric store to buy a stereo : CD , lector CD , radio , radio , radio , radio , the CD , radio , printed .
And in this single of electric electric nement , there 's a big number of components .
We can make six million and a half million different combinations using the components that there are only in one store .
You need to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Other the camps : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the phone services , and they were provide mama Bell .
It was doing the phone , not buy it .
A consequence of that , between the other , was that the telephone never break .
These days have gone .
Now , we have a variety of telephones , especially in the cell .
Here 's the cell of the future .
My favorite favorite , MP3 , cutes , cutters of the nose , and ford the hah for the crush .
If you don 't know , you know , you know , you 're not seen it in the home , you 're going to be sure you 're going to get .
And what the end is that people enters in the store , and the question is . And you know , you know , what the answer is ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell cell that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the aquises of aquises , you know , the same choices of choices .
Aule health care : it doesn 't happen in the United States , you go from the doctor and doctor , you know what to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and doctor says , " OK , we could do A , or B , " has these benefits and these benefits and these risks " B " has these benefits and these risks . What do you do ? "
You say , " Dap , what I should do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks and B has these benefits and B has these benefits and these benefits . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebad , " Doctor if she was me , what would do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not her . "
The result of the result of the malate of the malate , expression that makes it seem to be a nice thing .
But it 's not a moving the weight and the responsibility of taking decisions that would know , is the doctor , to somebody else knows -- and almost of course is sick -- and it 's not in the ideal condition to make the patient decisions , which is not in the ideal condition to make the patient decisions ,
There 's a huge marketing of products , direct people like me and you , that if you think about it doesn 't have any sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do they 're publishing them ?
The answer is that they want to doctor for asking the doctor to ask us to change the recipe .
Something as a fundamental identity is a question of choice , as you see in this vision , as you see in this vision . " We don 't want to force children to be a sex . " We don 't want to make a huge identity : we have to invent it .
And we can reinvent us how many times you agged .
That means that every morning , at the time , you have to decide that kind of person wants to be .
I 'm going to the family and marriage , a time , a time perspective communal , unhappy almost for anyone , was that was that married the most possible , and she was starting to children the most possible possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not even what to do after .
At day , it 's really to play .
I teach very intelligent students , and I do that , and I 'm 20 percent of work than a time .
And not because they 're not bright , not because they 're critical diligent .
And why are I impensiered , I 'm going to ask , " I should have married or not ? "
" I should have marriage ? I have to think before or the charrieer ? "
I 'm interrogorants .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this implessy not to completed the tasks that asked and not get a beautiful vote to my exament .
And they have to do it . They really are important questions .
Now , the job : we 're fortunate , like Carl underneath , because technology allows us to work every day , from the Hotel Randoll .
And in parently , there 's a corner , and I won 't tell you , where the WiFi WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What means , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work ? That 's all we have to go on the work ? That 's continually decided , whether we have to work or not .
We can go to see our child , and we can see our mobile phone in a cell , Blackberry in the other , and the notetee , and the notetee , and the notee booknees .
And even though they 're all spaces , every minute that we see our boy , we also asking the game , " I have to say , " Do you say what ? "
" I have to say that email ? I have to habits ? "
And even when the answer is no , " all this makes the experience of your child , very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the things , and big things , and big materials and life , materials and lifetime , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Obuts , there were some possibility , but it wasn 't a question of choice .
The world today is a miles of this : The dilemma is , " Is a good thing , or negative ? "
The answer is , the answer is .
The positives are all known , so I 'm going to talk about the negative ones .
All this is a company two negative effects of people .
The first one , paradoxically is that produces instead of liberation .
With a lot of options between which choose , it becomes very hard to do it .
I offer you a meaning example : a conduct study plans .
A lines that had access to Vanooowned data , the gigantic society of funding , with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are being offed in more , the percentage of two percent .
As 50 funds of offered , there is 10 percent in less adesions than when they 're only five . Why are only five . Why ?
Because with 50 funds of the flows , is sick , is sick to decide , and the choice is remained up to the inmorrow .
And I 'm asking , and I still ask , questions , and of course , questions , and of course , never get .
You know , not only means that these workers are going to be eating food for dogs because they 're not going to have enough money , it also wants to say that the decision is that the decision is so hating the funds of the complementary of the work .
Not participating , they 're losing to five dollars for the dator of the job , which would be well as a true to be .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too much choices .
And I think it makes the world .
" And to finish , for eternity : ketchup , ketchup , or maionese ? "
You 'd like to take the right decision , if it 's for ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the bottom , and nevertheless condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoid the paralysis and do a choice , we 're not feeling from the result of how we would be with less options between what we would choose .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of condless condless than it , and it 's not perfect , and it 's not perfect , it 's not perfect , you know , you can make a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that alternative imagined us . And what 's alternative imagined us industries the recovered by decision ,
And even when it was a good decision .
More are choices , the most is easy to dispilevering than any detail that is insodly insodings .
And there is , there is what economists call constood constood .
Dan Gilbert asked very well as the value that we 're going to the value things that we 're going to depend on what we 're compared with .
In the rest , when there are many options , you can represent the characteristics of the options of alternative , and be less sitting out .
Here 's an example . I shake all the people who are not New York .
But that 's what you probably think .
There 's this couple of Hamptons .
A place of a luxury place .
It 's beautiful . Oten journed . It 's all for them .
Not nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , sick , it 's Augodes . "
" All my neighbors to Manhattan is away . "
" I could just park their front at home . "
And it turns out two weeks , from the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking -- the possibility of parking .
The constitution of the satisfaction for what we have , even when choice was excellent .
And more is the options that we have to look at , the more the characteristics attractive , they 're going to be against the expensive opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This vignize us .
It talks about living the moment , and perhaps in living there .
But the most important point is that any thing you choose , you 're going to do , you don 't do other .
The things that we don 't choose are not to choose to attract what we do .
Third point : : exactly growing the expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new couple of jeans .
I 'm going to be jeans .
Once the jeans were just a guy , buy them and wasn 't cool , they were dissioned , only after they took them a life and wasn 't had a lot of times , they started to go well .
So , I went to buy a new , when the old ones were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cuts . "
The commit said , " He wants to slim phone , easy fit , relaxed fit ? "
He wants to make them with cernights or the buttons ? " Stonewashed , " or " acacross ? "
" Do you want to be the way ? "
" Soth them takes them , or high holds , " Bl blah , " was to elencare .
I was saying , and after a while I was able to say , " I want the guy -- which was the only kind of , " I want to say , " I want to all the sick jeans , and then I came out of the most of the things that I had ever had .
It was the massive . I had the best . I had achieved the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was that I was the worst of the things that choice was the waites were high , jeans had to be perfect .
I had expectations for me . I didn 't expect . I waiting nothing when it was only there was one guy , but when it was only 100 different , and I saw 100 different , at least one guy .
What I had buy was good , but not perfect .
After I had compared that choose with what I was trying to do with what I was trying to do .
The addition of options in life does not make people that increases the expectations that these are responding to the excellence of options themselves .
And this will make less satisfy , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing if you realize it .
Because if they know , you know what I 'm not talking about .
The truth of this looks more like this .
" You 'd better when he was worse . " The reason why he was the worst that she was better when she was worse , it was that when she was worst possible even meet .
On the world , in which we live -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the expectations of perfeeling -- the massive we can hope is that the things are at the height of the expectations .
You never surprised pleasures because your expectations , you know , you 're ingiant , you 're ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here is , " Basse " expectations " Yes , " Yes , you want . "
I mean , a little autobiographical moment -- which I 'm really married and my wife is really amazing .
I could not have to do better , I couldn 't have a tackle .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of the buy jeans out when there is only that you 're only that jeans of jeans is that when you 're not satisfied , and you say , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? "
The world is responsible . What could you do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a lot of them , and you buy the responsible , is the responsible , it 's the responsible , is the clear , and you 're .
You know , you know , you know , you know ,
With hundreds of variety , there are no scuses for the insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is , they 're going to go , they 're sitting and give the hit to them .
In the last few years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- of this honate wave is that people have experiences because the standards are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that collide is them .
So the final result is that we 're better , objectively , but we 're hearing worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's not true .
There is no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than having it , but it doesn 't have a lot of choice is better than a little choice .
There 's a critical value , magic value . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we have been supered by a piece of the level where the lives are improve our life .
Now , from political point -- I 've been on the political point -- I 've been on the political point .
What allows all this choice in industrial society is material .
There are many places in the world , and you know about it , where the problem is not that they have too choices .
The problem is that they have too a few too .
So the face of the modern thing I 'm talking about is a messy of modern , remember society .
And what does mit does to mention is this : Steve Levitt talked about how much those expensive and discovers seats for bombs are inuuuuuseful . It 's a sprines of money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendious , it 's not just unuuseful .
I 'm going to say , " Shotels .
They get worse .
If a little of what in our society allows allows choice was reverse in those people where people have too much possibility , it would be not only their life to improve , but also our our .
This is what economists call a paretian improvement .
A reduction of the reduction is good at all -- not only the poor -- not only the poor -- because of this choice , in a way back .
And to conclude , " Do you can become everything that you want , "
You know , people of culture , you 'll think , " What beliefs that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make anything in a glass . "
" A castrated imagination , a limited view of the world --
and that 's what I 've interpreted it so , at the beginning .
But then , thinking about it , instead , I realized that weight the long-gathering fish .
Because the reality of fact is if you send to the bocle , so that 's all you can 't get the freedom . You get the paralysis . You get the paralysis .
If you break the bock in a way that all you can decrease as much decrease .
You 're going to get the paralysis , and you reduced the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too , maybe for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the axis , within a few symbolic sphere is a recipe for infecicity and , for the rovement .
Thank you very much .
