The last year I 've shown these slides to demonstrate the artical calculation , which for almost three million years had the size of the 48 States , is records , it 's refted 40 percent .
But this subjects that gravity the problem because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice .
The artical calots is , in a certain sense , the cleanial culegiant climate system .
You won the winter and you get to summer .
The next slide is a fast-couple of the last 25 years .
The ice perenny gets are red in red red .
You see , you can see , you can see , you can see , you know ,
That is the ice in the winter , which is inverished .
You can see the ice cosidgn , of five years or more , is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , and the body smoke .
In 25 years , it 's spent from this .
This is a problem because the scale of the ice , the ice ground glacier around the ocean , where there are enormous amount of coal congeled that , slien-up , they 're turning turning turned into microbes .
I 'm totics of the totality of the atmospherical waste , that amount could double-scale totality could double-double-scream .
In some laghes , in Alaska a slightly is already rebuller on the water .
The professoresse Katey Walter of Alaska of Alaska team took a team pressed with a team .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow ! You 're going to be it .
A reason is that this termal exchange that termal exchange in the northern .
This is a glacial reme .
The brought it never had to similar .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the west s-egg .
If you want to know how it 's the level of the sea level of ice , here is where you get to sea .
These corrings are increasing rapidly .
On the other part of the planet : Antarttttars , the largest block of the planet .
The last month , the scientists have been sitting that the ice of the ice of the ice is in negative , and that the Antarctttarttttarly , which poor some of the sea , is particularly fasterly in the slide .
Equital to six feet of the floor , as Greenland .
On Himalayas , the third biggest block , you see new llabs , which few years ago were glacier .
40 percent of the world population was recognized half of the world population .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water source of this city .
The brought is increased .
But when you dimines , the same happens to the water .
In California the snow on the Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The backkkkils are in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , they 're free .
The growth secure in the world leads to a night increasing the incends .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm out of the normal and without previous .
Four times more numerous times in the last 30 years , I 've been respect 75 .
This is a whole sustainable .
If you look at it in the storc consequences .
In the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 224 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look the area of the Eastern Pacific area , and the west , and the west both , and on both the west site , where there 's a poor poor of the oxygen oceans .
The major causes of global warming , with deforestation , which is 20 percent of fossil fuel .
Oil is a problem , and coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions , together in China .
And he was proposed to build many other coal mix .
But we 're seeing a change of direction .
These are the annot projects in the last few years and some of alternative versus .
In the way , there 's a lot of political in our country .
The coal industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year for coal coal , which is a lit .
The picture of this picture --
I 'm Natal , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion gloss of coal switches .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the largest flow of scories in America .
It 's happened around Natal .
The nature of one of the coal industries was this .
Video : Will carbon , the coal , is a pace allegro and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's going to grow our economy .
Frosty coal is more and more and more .
It 's good , it 's a couple , and the workers maintend .
Al Gore : It 's a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest society is Massey Coal . This is his mountainly Massey Coal amministrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : Don Blanker : Al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima has launched two campaiged campaiged .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Accclean : ALergy see the climate change as a serious minacy to our business .
So our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a switches to make public and confused the truth on the coal .
Actually , coal is not sport .
We think it 's a good way -- it 's also a good profuse .
So not preocupateves of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Accclean : Carbon -- you 've heard a lot of it .
So you can see a turn in a turn in a structure of the clean .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noious , but that 's the sound of the clean technology .
The coal consumption is between the main global warming , but the night technology of coal warming , but the nice technology of coal that you see changes everything .
You look at a look . This is the hernal technology .
Al Gore : Indeed , the native alternative is connects to economic issues and the national security .
Video : Same is : The America is in America is in the crisis , the national security , the crisis .
The field that the flew all : our dependence on fossil fuel , as coal and oil oil , as coal and oil .
Now , there 's a new , audace solution for used to use .
Repower America : 100 percent clean energy , in 10 years .
A piano to re-fun America to work , make sure , and help us stop global warming .
It was inally , a solving that solve our problems .
Repower America . Scow more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : I mean , you know , you know , to realize energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to get the dependence of dependence on combustible combustible for killed the planet .
What we can do is , the future . I 'm here . Sun , a new energy network .
What you know two : Noves for bad retributes .
Complus : Repower . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old old old African old old African says , " If you want to go fast , you go down from the only .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
The last year TED I did an introduce an introduction on the LHC .
And I promise you to figure out to figure out how the machine works .
So here I 'm going to those who are . And the other time there were no , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever -- 27 miles of circumference .
His task is to remember the conditions that were less than a billion a second of the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All that 's just environment .
This is the car under Ginevra .
We 're pictures these mini-Bang Bang inside the relationship .
This is what I 'm work about . It 's called ATLAS -- it 's 44 meters and has a diameter of 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building , so you can see the proportions .
10 September last year , we have accese the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense festery in control .
It 's a picture of the first particles that had made all the turn of the LHC , entering in collision , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles inside the level .
In other words , when we see that picture 10 September 10 September , we knew that the machine worked , which is a great victory .
I don 't know if that was this to exultent us more or this , when somebody went on Google and saw that the beginning was this .
That means we had a cultural impact beyond the scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , I had to these dorrive dort dored .
These files get 13,000 printing when the machine works at the power of power .
Now , the technical between you look at the falls and say , " it 's not true . I 'm too table . They 're too table . "
And they can do that because when they 're very cold sets .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a temperature of the space between the space , these flows can bring that corrate .
In one of the guntures in the most noveallew in the LHC , there was a fect of fectory .
So the flows are slightly flightly , and the 13,000 printed practiced .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnets more than 20 tons , and that you have been switches about 30 centimeters .
They 're damaged about 50 magnetic .
We had to take them , what we 've done .
We 've restined them and falls .
They 're all coming back to their place above .
By the end of the Make , the LHC will be again .
We 're going to accensive , and we 're going to get a data of july , and we keep so our adventure to find out what the morons are the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain quick way , these accidents reaccess the value of science and engineering the value of science and engineering . It 's easy to confent .
I think the fact that it 's so difficult , the fact of the limits , I think it 's the value of things like LHC .
I 'd like to conclude with the words of a Inglute scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I imagine , in defense of his pupiler experiments of his pupiler , he said , " Nichael was so dangerous for the human return to the ideas , which is not measures that the ideas of science are definitive , that not messly wrong the ideas of the world , which is not mystanding to the world , and that our monstrings of the world , and that is not very worth of the world , and our words of the world , and the world , and the ideas of the ideas of the world , and the world , and the world 's new words of the ideas of the ideas of the world , and our world 's new words of the ideas of the ideas of the ideas of the ideas of the ideas of the world 's not be a triflo
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to start to ask you when you 're , you play with children , playing with the morning .
While you realize how you reach them and you get them , and you get them and move them , learning to think and solving problems of problems and slide problems .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand the way that we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , as a information information is inspired by the ush of our interaction with objects , with my consult Patts , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asked , " And if we use a computer , rather than having the only cursence of the digital chap that is moving a computer , rather than a digital desktop of the digital information with both hand-up ,
and you sistemard-pleasure ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable , is a big computer interactive as a bike .
In a few words , a Siftable , is a big computer interactive as a bike .
You can move with the hand , you can see the hand , you can see the movement and they have a screen and a screen .
But most of course , they 're physical objects , as you can just move to fun .
Siftable is a new ecosystems for manipulate information .
And as they become more physical , conscious knowledge of the other , and as they become more physical conscious , of the other way , of how we move , we can move , new and different statement of interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurated to show the video : if you including it in a direction , the video race is going to be back .
These interactive ritrats are conscious of others .
If I falling them , you 're interested in what they 're around .
If they 're circuit , they notice it and they can act a little bit .
If they 're circuit , they notice it and they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power of the data , to put a color like a color like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configured as secks and I can use them to put them in the middle , where they missing .
and I can use them to put them in the midddle , where they 're missing .
We can actually get a little too much , we can restop a little bit .
It 's also beautiful possibilities of learning , like languages , mathematics and games where people can try to see things fast , and see the results of the results , and see the results of the results , and see the results .
Now , I 'm --
This is a Fibonacci sequence that I do with a equations of equations .
We have a word of words that 's half of the words in Scarabean and Bogle .
Pratically , at every turn a letter to every turn into every Siftable , Pratically , at every turn a letter on every turn to be a letter on every Siftable , and while you try and words him on a direct .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you remised , and you have a new set of letter and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's children came in the game at the Media Lab , I did they tried them and I spent them a video .
They 're very fashion .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people many education .
You just say , " Compons of words , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's how other people who try it .
This is our younger heads , there on the right .
It really wanted to impact them .
They were only hort morning , for him .
Now , this is a whole application of a interactive chart .
We wanted to build a device for the learning of the Lui 's Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving Siftable their associated .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving Siftable their associated .
So it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is surprising .
David Merrill : Now brought a treator in the scene .
Video : The arange treator .
Bel ! Yeah ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yeah ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes .
So I school with Siftable and put them close can interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
And by by by by making their story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It 's a final story with the opened , and it can decide him how it 's flew .
DM : It 's a final story with the opened , and it can decide him how it 's flew .
Video : Voly , guns .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool , recently recently , to walk and execececececk music .
It 's a tool , recently recently , to willing and execececececececk music .
Siftable here are act from sounds like base , basically and the battery .
Each one of these have four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also get these sounds in a sequence from being being comporition .
And they just modify it just doing a sound and a sequence .
These are actually actually you can control from the vive , like reverbs and the filter .
The attacks at a particular sound , and then including it .
And then there are the general effects as time and fly , and they 're applied to the whole sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : DM : We 're going to put a base in two Siftable Siftable , " we 're going to put the basic , we add the base , we addition .
Now I put a low line .
Video : DM : Now address ...
Video : DM : And now I 'll put the battery phillumn .
Video : DM : DM : I can fast the whole sequence of the whole sequence of a hand or the other .
Video : DM : And I 'm going to add the low to the low flower to give more expression .
Video : DM : DM : I can recombining the flight .
So I don 't have to plan it first , but I can improvising it , but I can improvising it , and more corta .
And now , finally , I can focus the whole sequence inclinding the whole sequence .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is build new muth new interfaces as much as the brain and more and the body works .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this lost , and some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that new generation of designing this new generation of projects for digital media , which will bring information in our way that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writing .
I 'm writing books is my profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also the love and the fascine of my life .
And I don 't expect that I can change .
But , he said this , something particular happened in my life and my career , who brought me to remember the whole whole thing .
The particular thing is that I 've been written this book , this biography called Manogy , Prega , Ama , " which , diversity , diversity of books , for some reason books , for some reason that , in the world , and become a big sensationship .
And the result is that everywhere , now , people treat me as if I was convicted .
Daveled -- condanned , condanned !
They 're all worried and they say , " Do you don 't fear of fear of you not to fear more than doing ?
You don 't fear to continue to write all life without power to be able to create a book that can important somebody ?
What can important somebody ? "
It 's rashing , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that over 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a touching adolescent -- I was a writer .
I went to met the same reaction of the same reaction .
And people say , " Don 't you can 't have successful ?
Do you don 't have the humiliation of killed you ?
Do you wouldn 't have this waste for all life without that nothing is ever outside and die on a cumouth of such a fashion ctually fallish with fallisment fallisment ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I 've fear of all those things .
I always war .
And I have also fear of many other things that people could not indeed .
As the other things spaper and other things .
But , as I think I was writing the what I thought and I was wondering the last few is why is ?
Is it rational ?
It 's a lot of anyone who has to expect to be spent by a work that you 're sitting to do .
But what is there is so particularly in the impress that we can 't do about the health health health of other people in a way that other careers don 't do ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember one in his 40 years of activities where he was asked if he was fear to be engineer ?
Never -- that block of the engineer John , how does it ?
Do not work like that , you know ?
Onestly , the chemicals as group as group don 't have certainly , in the chemicals , driven reputation of being handed .
We have enough to writers , we have enough , this reputation , and not just the creative , we have this reputation of being huge mentally stunstable mentally .
And they 're not realize that you look at the sad of the magnificence of creative magnificence , only in the 20th century , they died young and often .
And the ones who don 't have suicipate to be really dissationship from their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he die , in the last interview , he said , " I killed a little more . " A extraordinary affermation about the work of their life .
But we don 't bad bad clean when we feel that because we 've heard these things that we 've completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in the end , it will always be a way of condrag .
And the question I want to bring everybody here today is : you 're agreed with this idea ?
It 's good to you , because they also looked at a house of distance to me not good for anything .
I think it 's hate .
And I think it 's even dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated century .
I think it 's better encourage our big creative minds .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start on the feeling of the suppose supposition , especially dangerous circumstances in my career .
That 's really -- you know , you 're pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I 've got about 40 years .
I have still about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that whatever I write now in the world as the work that I did after the work that I did after spent , I 'm going to spent successful successful of my last book .
I 'm slaved , because we 're all more or less friends here -- is likely that my greatest success is my wild .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start gin the nine of the nine , and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep going to continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question is , how do you know ?
And so it seems , after many reflections , that the way of work to keep write is to create a psychological costruction , OK ?
I have to find a security distance of security between me , which I 'm write , and my natural anxiety on which is going to get to the reaction of how to do we do it . And as I was trying to all the time , trying to find other society to see whether they could have have the best ideas and more sane .
about how to help people get creative inherent people to get inherent the risks of creativity .
And that research taken me to the ancient Great Rome .
I 'm going to see it because it gets back in circle and then back .
In the ancient Great and ancient -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity was inditiative from men , OK ?
It was thought the creativity was this spirit of the spirit , and it was involved to men , for the distant reasons , for distant reasons , for distant distant reasons .
The grew called the creativity of creativity , the creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , he believed that had a demon the wisdom .
The Romanished was the same idea , but they called that spirit a genius .
That 's great , because the Romanious , because the Romanious , they didn 't really think that a genius was very smart .
They think the genius was a genius of entities that had literally living in the walls of the study of a artist , a little bit like the Dobby , and that came out of the Dobby , and the outside of the artist and model to the outcome of the artist and model the outcome of that work .
Except -- here , that 's the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological costruction that protected you from the tube work .
And everybody knew that it was like , right ?
So the antients were protected by certain things , as a narcism , for example , right too .
If your work was exceptional work , you could not take all the gooddge , everybody knew that they were helped by this incorporate genius .
If your failed work , it wasn 't all your own failure , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable .
So people han conceived creativity in the Occident for a long time .
Then the Renascient came and everything changed , and nacious this big idea ; we meet the human being in the center of the universe , and more leaving space and more and more and writing space creatures to write space in the midddle .
This was the major of humanity , and people started thinking about creativity was completely by the idivide .
And for the first time in history , you started to refer this or that artist as a genius as a genius that one person with the genius .
And I 've got to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think that allow somebody , a simple person to believe as a recipient as a source , the source of all the mysteries of all the divines , creative , inosconcible , and a responsibility responsibility to fragile human fragiity .
It 's like to ask somebody to inguy the sun .
Deform and distores completely the ego and creates all of these intuative inestable expectations on the performance .
And I think it was this pression to destroyed the artists in the past 500 years .
And if that is true , and I think it 's , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't square 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there is probably people between the audience that would be a suspects of scientific notion , you do that they follow people on the notion , you do people follow their projects .
I 'm probably not convinced you all about that thing .
But the question I would like to bring is -- why not ?
Why don 't you think that way ?
Because it 's more sense than anything else that I 've ever heard to explain the exaspermany imprevebility of the process .
A process that , as anyone who ever ever ever ever taken to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- knows , you don 't buy .
And in fact , it can sometimes completely paranormal .
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poetesse Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but it was a poetesse for all life and told me that during his Virginia , working outside the Virginia , working out in the Virginia , and he was working out in the field .
He said he was like a fragorous broken of the air .
And that was rotates to the landscape .
He was hearing to come , because he was tremendous to be a tremendous floor .
He had a single thing to do about that point and it was , words , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , " you know , "
And so it goes to home and he was insequence , and he wouldn 't have to get a piece of paper and a match of paper and a match fast , while the traphion , and he slapped it , and sloud it on the page .
Other times couldn 't fast enough , so he was saying , and it goes into the house and run and spoetry the rotolar was in the home , and she would continue to drive through the landscape , and he would keep rotolar through the landscape , and he said , " another poet . "
Then there were the time -- this piece I won 't have -- there were moments where the floor of moments when it was almost lost , OK ?
So , he was running up to the house and was trying to the card and the poem was going through , and he was a huge in the way that was moving , and then he said , " which was as if you sleep with the hand the step cohand and the floor .
He was offered the poem , and he was put it in his body and turned it into his body and turned it on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page and the last word .
So when I felt that -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly equal to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a condition !
I 'm a mulo , and my way of work is , and I 'm going to wake up to the same oraries every day and then to work and get a gooften .
But even I , in my head , I 've strilled against that thing , at times .
And I guess that many of you have the fact .
You know , even if the work and ideas came up to me by a certain source I could not honest .
What is that thing ?
And how can we relationship to it 's a way that you don 't lose the heads , but , rather , rather , what does remaintain us ?
As I record , the best example of the contemporary example I have is the Tom Maits , which I 've been different years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of the life has been the incarnation of the artist game contemporary , trying to contemporary these species of impulses , to manage , to realize these kind of impulses totally interized .
But then I invest , he got up , and a day while she was driving on a car in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
It was going to fast and all of a sent tract of the cheeeating little bit of the electricity , which is going to inspiration , and truly , and the wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and the desider , but not as you take it .
It has not a piece of paper , not has a math , not has a math register .
So he begins to hear this kind of old anxiety is growing in him , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm obsessed by this song .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do . "
And instead of going to go into the panic , they stop .
It was the whole process , and he did something completely new .
I just look at the sky and said , " Sort , don 't see I driving ? "
" It looks like you can write a song now ?
If you really want to exists , back to a more opports when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , I won to important somebody else today .
I went to disturbed Leonard Cohen . "
And his process of the process of changed .
I don 't work , the work was still dark as a always .
But the process , and the weight that was required when the genius , the genius , the genius outside of him who was caused to him to remainly remainly remainly remainly , and remained .
but it wasn 't this beculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange thing and external thing that was , but not Tom .
So as the story started changing a little bit the way I was working in and I was saved and I was saved once .
This idea , I save when I was writing " Manogy , Prega , Ama , and fall in one of those cave of the disperation where we 're going to all when we 're working on something , and we won 't and start thinking that will be a disaster , which is going to be a disaster , which is the worst the worst book that the worst ever written .
Not just the worst , just the worst book .
And I started thinking about gathering this project .
But then I remember Tom I was talking about the air and I tried to the air and I tried to us .
So I got my face in the hand I realized my hundred my hundred the vacuum .
And I said to high , " SS , what do we know , if this is not bright ?
Because as I see I 'm going to put all I have no longer than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to present your part .
Okay . But if you don 't know what , I don 't do .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I would like to favor that I 've been shown to me today , I 've been shown to the end of the North Africa 's willing to the North Africa 's deserts in North people were sought for damances to the midddances of the middle-hours and hours .
And they were always magnificence , because the ballers were professionists and they were great .
But every one of these artists , something happened , and one of these artists becomes actually transendent .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you all saw it at a certain point , a performance like .
It was like the time stopped , and the dancing ballery through a kind of loud , and not doing anything else on the sun , as 1,000 nights before , but everything was sitting down .
And suddenly , not appeared as a human .
But you accinity from the divinity and the fire in the fire of the divinity .
And when this happened , the time , the people knew what was called him with his name .
They were saying the hands and began to cantate , " Allah , Allah , God , Allah , God . "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note -- when the Morinvading the south of Spain , I got this habitude with them and flew into the coured by " Allah , Allah , Allah , " that 's Olay , " that you can hear in the ride or floor in the floor .
In Spain , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , " Allah , the words , " Allah , " Spaper , " I 'm going to realize , " I 'm going to go .
And it 's great because we need it .
But the problem is the day , the day is the day , for the ballery . And you wake up and find that they 're the 11 of the morning of Martedust , and the scorce of God .
It 's just a mortal with bad to the ginoccurred , and maybe not ever ever ever ever ever heard to that alteeth .
And maybe nobody switches the name of God still while it 's going to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful recognizations to make in a creative life .
But maybe it has to be so angot-force if you can 't believe , intural , inturn , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being being from yourself .
But you just believe that they 're furniture data in the squisite squisity of this squisity part of your life that you have to get to somebody else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think it all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly as I thought for different months in the work of the book that I 'm going to publish , I 'm going to dangerous , spent , careful , was attession-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-hand-up , and it 's a very successful .
And what I 've got to continue to tell me when I feel elected by this is , not willing .
Don 't just the way . It 's just your work .
Continuary present-powered you 're going to be .
If your work is balls , balance .
If the divine , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , some kind of wonderful , for one moment through your effort , then you know , "
You know , you do the same dance .
" Olay ! "
I think you 've got to teach it .
" Olay ! " at yourself , even only for the love of human loador minardaggin tal wild you to stay up the continuous .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Olay !
As you know , I 've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , about what you can mean and the discovery of new genes .
Now we 're starting a new path . We started digitalize biology and now now to the biology and now we 're going to start in a new phase of biology , designing and synthetizing and synthetizing .
We 've always been trying to bring big questions .
" What is life ? " is something that many biologists I think have been trying to figure out lifts .
We tried different approaches , reduced to the minimals .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to move from the analogical world of the biology of computing .
Now we 're going to ask : We can regenerate life , or new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genitalium that can autorem in the laboratory .
And we tried to reduce the genome to get a genome to create one more smaller .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of the 500 of the 500 of the 500 that are here .
But when we look at his metabolic maps , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
I redetection , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , is very improbable that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to procrew was synthesize this cromosoma so that they could modify the components to bring some of these questions fundamental questions .
And so we started the " adventure of " Point we can synthesize a cromosoma ? "
It can be the chemistry conscious molecules that we never ever ever could create before we ?
And , in case , we can make a cromosom ?
A cromosoma is just a chemist of chemist .
The speakers we 're able to digitalize the life is growing up is exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , rather procredit , rather procrete .
And our most recent recently reporting it on a exponential curve .
We 've been started more than 15 years ago .
The process has require many pass , starting with a bioetic review before we started the first experiments .
But we 've discovered that DNA is very difficult .
There are thousand machines of DNA machines , the long-50 long-50 long-50 letter , and it 's a process of degenerative process : the longer segment is longer , the more segment is , more errors .
So we had to develop a new method for this fragments and correct the herrors .
And this was our first attempt , to start by the digital information genome of the genome of Phi X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills killed .
We designed the frments , effectively the correction of errors and get a molecule of DNA , about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemist of chemist , and we put it into the bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and produring the viral particles .
The viral particles have been required by the cell , they 're back and destroyed the E. coli .
I spoke about recently the oil industry , and they have certainly compressed that they have certainly compressed this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where software can actually build his hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in larger .
We wanted to build the whole cromosom .
They 're more than 580 mies of genetic code .
So we thought I 'd build it in seven of the viruses , so that we could change the seven of seven to understand what the components are of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 accuratess , it was a mile for every 10 miles .
We 've discovered , resequency . If we had used that original sequence . If we had never been able to be able to work .
A part of the process is designing longer segments that are overheads of 50 letter to build more than 50 letter to build to build smaller subunity more than 50 longer working together .
We try to be the only one here .
You probably have bed the bed that we put in the filively .
So , think it 's a genetic code on four letter : A , C , C , C , Gs and T.
Three of those letters together codifying about 20 minoacids , and there 's a specific order to each amminoes .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frankly , putting ,
What we did in the beginning was autograph .
Some have been deluses from the fact that it wasn 't poetry .
We designed these segments to just unprecisely them with enzymes .
There are ency that repair them and put them assist .
And we started assembly assembly , starting with segments from five to seven miles , unending up to segments of 24 mies letter , until they get to 72 mies to them .
We 've been produced these segments in abundance , so that we 're trying to make a extra himself that we 're trying to create a very very robust -- you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatizing the process .
So , this seems the tabellon a basket playoff .
When we get these very long segments , more than 100 miles , the more than 100 miles , they don 't grow more directly in the E. coli .
It goes to the molecular modern limits of molecular biology .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called omological recombination , which in biology is used to reply repair the DNA that can unprecisely the segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , it can absorbed three million rad of radiation .
You can see in the superior as his chromosoma is destruct .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms are completely to be completely .
They can live under the vacuum .
They 're absolutely certain that life exists in space , and you can be saying new water .
In fact , NASA , the NASA has shown that this happens .
This is a picture of the molecule that we 've built these processes , just using the lought-handed design of the segments that you can insert .
The lists is automatically .
This picture was not taken with a electronic microscope , but with a microscope microscope .
It 's a molecule that we can see it with a microscopic microscopic law .
These are pictures that they cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publish we 've done a little time ago .
They 're more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined structure that man ever .
It 's a weight molecular weight to 300 million .
If we were going to get that with a 10 without spaces , you 'd like 142 pages to turn this genetic code .
Now , how do we do that ?
Obviously , you can a virus is a game .
It 's a little more complicated when you use batters .
It 's also the simpler when you 're cells as our eucarily : you can just extract the nucleus and put another , which is basically the clonation process .
In the bacterium , the archaea is instead of integrated inside the cell , but we 've recently recently demonstrated that we 're able to do a transplant of a cell bank cell by one cellula to another and activity .
We can have a cromosoma starting from a microbial species .
The two are different as men from the topi .
We have added some gene gene in more way that you could choose for this chromosoma .
The men with the scioldes in a way that I kill all proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was stupendowntown -- and you 're appreciate our sophisticatoogized pursuma is gone .
And we thought we won 't go beyond , but we 've tried to spines more in the way .
This is one of the major mechanisms .
We 've discovered that many species have added a third or a third couple of a thousands of new tracks in a thousands of new tracks .
So who think about evolution as a only gene to evolution as a gene and modies ,
There 's a restriction called restription that advanticipation that advantician .
The cromosoma that was in the cells .
The cell phone that we 've got inserit-cell phone .
It 's expressed , and recognized the other chromosoma as a material , and masticated with only the cell cell and the new cell cell cell cell cell .
it blue because of the genes that we 've been insered .
And in a short time , all the characteristics of a species are gone , and it turned of all over a new species , based on the new software that we 've been insered in the cell .
All the proteins are changed , the members are changed , and when we read the genetic code of exactly what we 've been taking you .
Now , this could seem alchemy genetic , but you can 't change the DNA software , we can change things in a pretty such enough such .
Now , I 've already explained that here is not about genesis -- but we 've been progress from three million years and a half years of evolution , and I 've told that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian is going to be a new version of this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty obvious when we think about our necessities .
We 're going to move from six and a half billion in the next 40 years .
Right for example : I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 , they 'll be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , clean , and gasoline for six billion and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more hyes .
We use more than five billion coal baries , over 30 billion baries .
That means millions of baribles a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to reduce them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole of CO2 of these materials that 's hemissioned in the atmosphere .
At day , thank you with scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they 're designing the future .
The electritritric industry only is a dozen about components , and think about how many different things came out .
Our limits here are basically the biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of these rapid metods of synthesization , that we call a combatory combatory .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million cromosomes a million cromosomes a day .
Think about processing these 20 million genes or different genes or to try to get the processes to make eight-handed , new vaccines , we can change , because in a small team , and create more molecular biology .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for a living of survival , chemical production , chemical or fuel , production of etc .
This is an instantaneous instantaneous instantaneous instantly that we 're working for being able to seat and design species to the computer .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
Now we 're focused on quarters of fourth generation .
You also have seen you that extract from the grate was a wild experiment .
We have fuel fuel and third generation that will be enough to be fairly on the higher value coal of the higher value , like eight-butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increasing more than the cost of food and limitargument the cost of food and limited the disponity would transform CO2 in matter , and we think we can have this purpose this , and we think we could have the first coal of this purpose , and we think we could have the first coal of those generation in the same generation in about 18 months .
The sunlight sunlight is a methodownstood -- but in our discoveries all over the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we 've been described in 1996 .
It lives in the ocean , about 2500 feet of depth of the water .
They 're metane from the CO2 using molecular hydrogen molecular source .
We 're trying to figure out if we can incanalate CO2 , which can easily be transported by the tubes , convert that CO2 in fuel , to drive this process .
So we think we could be able to increase what we could increase what the basic question of what the basic question is , " which is the life . " And we have the modity -- we have the modity of oil industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where you ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And we 're working for using the same methods to use the same methods to create vaccines .
You saw this year with the influence , we 're always back to a year and a dollar in less when you 're going to find the wine , right .
I think what you can change building slide in a fight-and-up .
That 's how the future could start seem to look at changing , the tree of evolution , acceling the evolution of synthetic bacteria , archades , and finally incelluence ekaries .
We 're so far from the best people .
Our purpose is to try to do a long enough enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'll show you , the most fastest possible , some workers , some of the new technology that we 've taken Microsoft in following a year ago . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
It 's a visual environment that you can interact is to local local amount of data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of gabyte photos with a kind of zostant photostant and , for a speaking , and a willing panoramic speaking , as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amounts of information that we see , as big these data or data are gathering or images .
Most of the photograph are digital photograph , but this is a provent from the Bilibrary of Congressed , and refly in the middle of 300 megapixel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen on your screen in any time . It 's a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data , not images .
This is the Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
To show you that it 's just about textbooks , we can do something like that , to actually show you that it 's a real representation of the textbook , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a book .
It 's not the advice .
This is a more realistic example . This is a number of the Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of a fire of a revision or a quotidian , which is for nature a lot of a lot .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We 've created a fashion advertising -- much more higher than what you use in a normal public publicity -- and we put you into the extra farming content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific specific patternal model .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas for eliminate limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to put the end to the pop-up and other cheries like , not should be necessary .
Of course , the maping is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not lose , I don 't want to say we have contributes to this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. .
So , we 're going to go to something else .
This is actually actually , from the vive on the web ; you can go to the web ; you can see it .
This is a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
A is Seadragon and the other is a visual research a very interesting research by Noah Snavority , a student of the University of Washington , with Steve Steve Szeliski .
And it 's from Seb , gested by Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can get from a picture to the other kind of experience .
But the space of the images here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization computing have recorded these images together , so that they corresponding to recorrespond to the real place in the recorded pictures -- all of these things are closed close to the Rococcious sadesiesian -- they 're taken . So you see the elements of a sli-st-land-stable , and these things are all the space space space are all all connected space space .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space .
I want to spend up one of the original data of Noahhhasively -- and this is from a prototype of Photosynth that we 've done for the first time , the scorsth -- to show you what I think is the key behind technology , the Photosympth . And it 's not necessarily to look at the environments . And it 's not necessarily by looking at the environments we 've been doing in the site .
We 've had to worry about legal expects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Notrrace of Notre Dame . Baast digitate . Baast digitate . Baast , you can see images of the maglights , and you get images of the maglights , and saying . Except is a picture that 's discovery that is to discovery .
So they 're all images , Flickr and they were all connected to this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this way simple .
You know , I would never have thought I would never have thought I 'm going to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratification to receive this kind of acades here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different types of different types of square of different square to the phone of the phones in the SLR , a significant number of meaning , must be together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try to look for those strange .
Many are blocked by faces , etc .
Somewhere there is a series of photographs -- here you 're going to be .
This is a Notre poster Dame recorrectly .
We can move from the poster to the vision of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the ential memory of how the land is the floor of visual -- and connected everybody .
All those pictures become connected , more than parts .
You have a model of the land that emerges .
You think about this as a cooling Stephen Lawler 's work on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as they use , and the people that are using it , and the advantages for the use of the use .
Their pictures are marsted with other people .
If somebody is the idea of the idea of those data saying the name , my name photo Notre the picture of Notre of the catthedral picture of all of those data , and I can use it for immerged in that space , in that metaphor , in that metaphor , in that metaphor , in that metaphor , in that meeting a cross-moda , blind photo-moda and red social experience of red red moda .
Of course , a consequence of all this is virtual model of any interesting part of the land , collapse of any interesting patterns , you know , not just as a satellite images and satellitarian images and similar , but from the college memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software is going to be able to feel that you 're going to do is that a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs , all the photographs and they 're going to be basically connected with ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's going to be discover is actually discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the basis on the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about semantic information that 's semantic information that many of these images have been possible images .
As you get a picture of images on the Web , you digite a sentence and the textbook has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what happens if that pictures you connects all your pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of wealth and the amount of recheck that is really huge . It 's a classic classic classic .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible .
BAA : I thank you .
One of the main pile-main pleass , and one of the research of the etnographics research is the power live in the wind , between the wind , between the wind , the wind , the wind the piogges , the wind in the floor , you 're in the floor of the plants .
Basti think the Jaguar travel even beyond the Via Lattea , or the the most of the Inuit is still a model of meaningful , or in Himalayas , the budddddans are still follow the importance of Dharma , to remember the important of the major inside of the city , and the idea that the world that we live in not in an assumed sense ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stypes has done , well , very good , generations ago .
And , of course , we all share the essential tracts .
All we 're all going to do . All we 're going to do .
We 're subjects of beginning .
We need to death inesorability of death , so you don 't surprised and ballize --
We all have a art .
What hits is the particular rhythm , the rhythm of every culture .
Not that they 're the Penan inforests of the Borneo , or the follows of Haiti , or the guerriers of the Kaisut 's wern , or the wern Curandmels , the Curandmels , or a camp in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak along the gathering of the gadea , the mother of the world .
All these people teaching us that there are other ways of exists of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of modes in the world .
And if you reflect a moment , it 's a concept that can hope .
And then , the cultures of the world cultures of the world , they create a spiritual life and cultural that we fly , the planet , and it 's important for the well-being as the planet as the biological ragnature as a biological biogic .
And you can think about this cultural ragnature as a a lecnosphere , and you can defining the so-called the total sum of all the conceptions , inspiration , ideas , inspiration , inspiration , inspiration , inspiration ,
The etnosphere is the great patrimony of humanity .
It 's the symbols of what we 're and what we can be in as a species .
And because biosphere was free consumed by the biosphere , as a free and purthrow much more .
No biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent of all species has been or false -- it 's on the hort of the simply extinct , because it 's false -- in the most optimistraight of biological diversity . And you don 't even closer to the most optimistic diversity .
The index of all that is , of course , the linguistic loss .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a vocabulary , or a series of rules .
A language is the spraw of the human spirit .
It 's the midddle that the animal comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest , a brilliant , a bacin mind , a spiritual ecosystem of spiritual possibility .
And the 6,000 languages , as we sitting here in Monterey , at least half of the kids .
They don 't get more teached to children , which means , unless you wouldn 't walk ,
What is the sad is more than being the sad , the last one of the site , the last one to talk about a language , not to get the wisdom of advance or ancient promise the promise of children ?
This is horring was the state of somebody in the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , a high high switches in the last syllabe of a ancient language .
And I know somebody who are going to say , " Isn 't it anymore ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we 're all the same language ? " Well , we 're all talking to all yorba . We talk about cantonese .
Let 's talk kogs .
You 'll see a tract thing that means not to talk about power .
I 'd like to do you a journey through the labeled .
a little journey in the etnossphere to give you a little bit of what we 're lost .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of exists . " I mean , " I really have different ways of exists .
Let 's take for example , this Barasana , in Amazon , the settle-ail population , which credit the mytholic baby , which creds to the waste of the sacre sacred blue .
It 's a popular that is not able to distinguish the blue because the blue is identified in the time of the forest , which depends on the forest , which depends the popular .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial regulated , " exogamia " : you have to spoke a different language .
All of this radical bedded in the past , yet the particularity is that in these families that are talking about six or seven lingues because of the matrimons because of the matrimons of marriages .
They 're limited to listen and then they start talking .
Let 's take one of the most interesting tribes I lived , the Worani Waorani Eastern Ecuador a popular popular that had been the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionaries have been told a compost .
They did taken from the high pictures that they had been in a few who had adichevoles , forest that this population population population had never seen bi-dimensional popular forest .
They 've gathered the picture of the earth , they spent the research , and not find nothing , they have concluded that they were going to the district , and they killed the five missionarious missionaries with the lance .
But the Worani are not only killed the straneors .
They killed to kill them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by the same .
We 're rising high generations and we found two cases of natural death and when we sticked to know , they had a lot of them who was invited so that one of them was invited so that he died by refloor of the forest . And they had a huge knowledge of the forest .
The cters were able to recognize the animal urina as 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early ' 80s , I was assigned a very interesting task when my professor of Harvard ases asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to me to intruly intruly the power of Duvalivation and Tonton Macoes , and impossessing in the fast of the speaking fast .
To make sense of miraculous , I should have to understand the Vodoun culture and the Vodoun and the Vodoo , is not magnect .
It 's pretty much than a complex metaphysical view of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Budddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent comes up , and I thought that sub-Saharan Africa has not been religious . And instead of slavery . And he did and the Vodoo , is not that the distilled by these religious concepts of these religious concepts of slavery in the slavery .
What makes the voodoo is the voodoo is the relationship between life and death .
So , the people do hide .
The spirits can be invinvocated by the Great Acqua , and they replace in the dance of the dance and replace in the vive vive the vive of the vive vive way that for a brief actil the goal .
So , the voodooists are saying , " You 're white white white you 're going to talk about God .
We say in the temple and we divention the temple and we divention .
And the moment you 're going to be the spirit that you guide , as you can do you of the bad ?
So you 're looking at these incredible events : follow voodoo in the state of trance that touching unning infuse .
And in all the populations with the most extraordinary people are the Kogi Nevada Sierra Nevada in Sierra Nevada , in Colombia sector .
For a huge civilization that once lies living on the planure of Colombia in the attention of the conquista , the popular population , the popular population , the population was going to the massive characters .
In a blood continent , this popular continent , this was never conquered by the spages .
At today , they 're governed by a clero , but their formation is very extraordinary .
The young people followed out from the family to the families to three or four years , and they live in a good world and shared in a good world and shape for the ice of the ice of the ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years of the gestation of the gestation that spent the nine months of gestation , now are metaphically in the user of the Great Mother .
So , that 's all of the time , they get accultured to the values of their society , values that they predict and just their predict to maintaining the cost of their cost equilibrium equilibrium .
At termination of this incredible beginning , they 're improvisually taken out and for the first time in life , in the age of the age of the first claim , they see a holy . And in that account of the first claim , when the sun backyourself is confer . The predict of the beautiful landscape . The predict does a past . The predict does a past .
" Viison ? I 'm told you .
It 's study . Now it 's a protect .
It 's called the largest fraction and they say we , brothers , we 're the colputs of the world .
This is intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the indeed populations and environment , we 're Resau and the old story of the noble self-vage , which is a razy concept in his simplicity or maybe invote , and we say that these populations are closer to the Earth of us .
The ingenious populs are not feeling .
There 's no space for these things in the palues of the Aststststicat the Tibet , but you 're going to the time and returns , created a mystic of the Earth based on the end of being known , but on a balures of closer , but on a balures , but on a bad neighbors -- because it infection is not to human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
It 's a saying that a child of the Ande that the mountain is a spirit of Apu that the mountain is a spirit of the Montana is going to be a deeply different relationship of the Montana , and it 's going to be a different ratic . And it 's going to a little bit of the Montana 's going to be a mass of rocks that a mountain of rocks that a swaitable of rocks that a swed mountain .
That 's the dimtained a spirit or a mineral craft .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between the natural and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Columbia Britannica credating that the forests served to be cut .
And that I made a different human being from my friends Kwakiutl that believe that the forests are the Hukuk the demour of the paradise and the stories of the paradise and the spirites of the paradise and the spirits that live in the earth of the Hamateous begination .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start understanding some of their sensational discoveries . We can make this plant .
I 've taken this picture to open in the northern Amazon .
Mayahuash some of you have heard of the ayahuash , the most powerful such of the sciamanic repertoilet .
What makes the ayahuash layahuash is not the potential of the sustainable , but its elected . It 's composed to two elements .
It 's a bad , this leaving leaving a series of racarboline , harmine and harmine , slightly slightly slightly .
Take the only plant is a blue that you have a little bit of consciousness , but it 's mixed with the leaves of the cooking ften , the coffee of the coffee said Psychotridis .
This is a triptamine powerful plants , very similar to the serotonin the site , dimethyltryplured five , methoxyltryplt----------------------------------------------------------------------------------like sent powerful plants ,
If you ever see the Yanomami , you know , the nase the such that they do from a different set of species , anched methoxyltrypltrypamine .
And you 're going to be a polls on the nose is a little bit like being spared by a smoke of pursuit . And then you can be a death of electricity . Risate a distortion of the reality .
I often I had often , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who waste was psychedelic , with his discovery of fungi , with his discovery of fungi .
I mean , my thesis , you can 't classroom these tripamine as because if you 're not told , you can 't tell any one of the hallucinated . And you can 't tell anybody of being halluciny . They can 't be assumptles because they 're money from a naturally in the intestine , detailable to the monamineered , detailable to the intestine , detailable to the monamineered .
It 's possible to absuit just if you 're just a little bit of other chemicals that money the MAO .
Now it 's the beautiful : the quooline that are in this liana is injumps , the same kind of the same kind of potential . The question is needed to be able to be able to be the tripamine . The question is saying , in a 80,000 species of plants , how these populations are not , but that if you combine , you know , they can create a biochemical version that is summmmmen .
We use the great eulied of the proof and error , which can revealing .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll tell us . "
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuash , which is nected in the forest , and our eyes will be going to the willing in the same species .
If we ask them as they stuck their txonomy will say , " I thought of plants , " I thought of plants , you don 't know everything ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night of lun-driven , and each other square in a tone .
With this is not sleep to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting than to count the stami .
Now , the problem is that even the problem is that even those of us who have heart populations are pitted in the ingenes are pitted to our real world , but in a few way reduced to the hurt world , and it 's pass beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it won 't remind for his driver or its innovations , but rather as the innovations , but rather as the time we stopped and we 've been used to destopped , or passively destrow of biological diversity and cultural diversity of the planet .
All cultures through the secoli have been involved in a dance for new possibilities of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux don 't have being Sioux when they put out of the arco and fit as well as Americans don 't stop being Americans when they 're part of Americans when they 're wallowed by the horse and hot .
It 's not the change or technology that they mint the integrity of ethnossphere . It 's power .
The flight of the domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you find that these are not cultures that these are not cultures are cultures .
They 're creatures and dynamics dynamics , identify from identify forces that are beyond their adaptation .
Which is you can discofy in the Penan patria of the Penan --
a populpular nomake Sarawak , in the asian , a popular popular , a popular population , and now re-free population , and now reduced to the services of the rive , where you can see the inquinquinated willer , where you can see the the inquinquinated hume , where you can see the hume of the navi Meridie , where the navi Merious ,
taking the stage of the wood I 'm going to the wood dream .
Or in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are the disease that have come to the discovery of the golden .
If we 're going to move the Tibet , where I 'm doing many research , you 'll see the during the political domination .
As the genocide , the physical extinction of a popular population , but the etnocide , the etnocide , the destruction of the lifetnocide , not just condinly , it 's not only not convicted , but it 's not just convicted , but it 's a lot of the strategy development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet until you can 't understand the Tibet .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in China in China , in China through Tibet , coming to Lhasa with a young connected , but only came to Lhasa I realized what we feel about .
6,000 sacred sacred you into polly-handed .
1.2 million people killed by the military military during the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical to the Panched Lama .
which means it was killed to the time of Chinese invasion .
Her , the uncrowed Sua deaths in the waiting .
Her mother was impresoned and his colpa was recognized .
It was taken to hide in the age of two years of the age of two years , under his gonna because he could not live without him .
The sister , who did the same , was put in reeducation .
A day day , he willer a day couple of Mao and , for this transgression , was mesh the works of the forced works for seven years .
The pain of the Tibet can be insubpportable , but the reinside of the population is from the population .
At the end , all you reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the world monocromatic world , or we want to acght the policicromate world ,
The great anthropologiogs Margaret Mead , before he die said that , his biggest fear was that , in our going to go to this amorago , not just see the whole gamm of human imagination , but one day we 'll see the whole game of human imagination , but one day we 'll be a day , but one day we 're a day a sonce of sonce , but there were others .
And it 's umillion to remind that our species is there for 60,000 years .
The Neolitical Rivolution , who gave us agriculture , which made us suck to the cult of the seed cult , and replacing the poetry of the cler , creating the gerarchy of the specialization , and we 're talking about 10,000 years ago .
The industrialized world has been 300 years .
That 's history of whatever I 'm not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we should be able to deal in the millennia to come .
When these kinds of cultures are asked what it means to be human , they 're answering to being , respond with 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that all of us all rises , we 're all aware of the possibility of being known , which has to make all the people and all the people who are saying challenges and all the gardens can track . And there 's great moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the norththrow of Baffin , when I went to hunt balene , when I went to hunt of the Inuit , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , I told story of his grandfather .
The canadical government has not always been gentle with the Inuit and in the ' 50s to stand in the ' 50s to stand in colonies .
The grandfather than this man refed to go .
The family , I was told for his life , and brought all the arms , and all his attitude .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't teach cold ,
The sledge of the slexes were made of heavy blue .
The grandfather than this man didn 't intimise from the artical night or the library that was suffing .
It 's gathered out , it 's calculated the panalons in the skin ball and defected in their hand . When the fecstered , they 've been congelated , and working on a moama .
He switched on the pointing of this caccept and when they became solid , he killed a dog .
He wasn 't the dog and created a brid , with the household , and he 's created another dog , and it 's disappeared on the bankey , and it 's disappeared on the bkey .
We want to talk about cavarsely with nothing ?
In the 1999 , the canadly N9 canador redded the total control of a larger area of territory of California and Texas the Texas the California and Texas the gathered together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's an independent territory . They all have the minerary resources .
One splendid of how a nation-state can remember with his popular .
And , finally , I think it 's pretty obvious .
For somebody is home .
They represent sections of the human imagination that they 're at the high of the time . And for us all of these children , as the dreams of our children , become part of the hope .
For finally , we have National Geographic , we convinced that politicians will never get to nothing .
We believe that polemies --
[ Applauses ] they 're not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the world . Every best institution to tell the world . Every month of our site . Every month , our site site .
156 countries transmit our television canal canal .
Our revies are laughts from millions of people .
Our work is travel in the etnosphere to bring our audience in a place of wonderful cultural world , and hopefult-up as they saw and , hopefult-pology , they 'll hope , hables , they 'll be used to be in the midddle of life in a pluralists in a pluralistic world . And we have to find a life in a pluralistic world .
where the wisdom of all the popular can contributing our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I 've written in this book that I hope you 've already heard and try to evidence some connections , in case not them .
I 'd like to start with what I call the dogma officer .
The dogma offices of what ?
The dogma offices all the Western society . The dogma offical dogma is , " If we want to massive well-being of our citizens . " The way to do is massive . "
The reason is , from a hand in the fact that freedom is in itself a value , it 's useful , useful , essential for humans .
On the other is in the fact that if we 're free , each of us can actually act for all that massive , our well-being , without any of any of the well-being , not any of the decide in name .
The way to massive freedom is massive freedom .
More choices , the more choices are free , and more than their well-being .
This is so deeply radicated , it 's so deeply realized in society that no one would be such .
And it 's also deeply radicated in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly great .
I 'm a simple note about the condition of switches .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditiments , without content 10 oil variety of oil and 12 acectrum and 12 acecuge balsamic cost that no one of the 12 conditivegetable in the including circumstance that no one of the 175 already ready ready ready ready ready ready ready ready to your degree .
That 's what the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronic store for buy a stereo stereo , lector , lector , radio , radio , radio , radio , prints .
And in this single electronic negoties , there 's a big number of components .
We can do six million and a half of different different different and a half of different smoke .
You need to admit 's so much choice .
Other the camps : the world of communications .
Anoce , when I was a child , you could get all the phone services the phone services of the mom services , to bell .
It was giving the phone , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , between the other , was that the phone was never break .
These days have gone .
We have a lot of telephone variety of telephone , especially between the cell phone .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is in the midddle , lector , the nose of the nose , and the ford to the crum .
If you don 't have seen it in the store under the store , you 're going to get you to get it .
And what happens is that people entering in the stopping and question . And you know , what is the answer ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do it too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the busters , you can actually be the same choices .
Assistence sanitary : it doesn 't happen in the United States that you 're going to be in the United States , what you have to do .
Instead , I won the doctor , and doctor says , " OK , we could do A . A , or B " has these benefits and these risks . " Big benefits and these risks . What do you want ?
You say , " Dottes , what I should do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , and B has these benefits and these benefits . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebad , " Dottore if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor , " But I 'm not her . "
The result of the result of the malate , expression that makes it look like a great thing .
But it 's actually not that a moving the weight and responsibility for somebody knows that , knows the doctor , to somebody else -- and you don 't know -- and almost certainly is maled -- and so not in the ideal condition to take the patient .
There 's a huge marketing of products drug , direct people like me and you , that if you think there 's no sense , because you can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do you know ?
The answer is that they want to be doctor for asking to ask them to change us .
Something as it is , as our identity ever is a hort issue , as you see in this vision , as you see in this vision . " We don 't want to force the children . They 're going to ceat their sex at the right time . " We don 't have to be able to invent .
And we can reinventing how many times we can do it .
That means that every morning , at the morning , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
I 'm driving family and marriage , a time time the community , a communal time , unsentence the most possible time , and he was that you had the most fashion , and began to the floor possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not when , and not even what to do after .
At day , all the time , it 's really to play .
I teach very smart students , and I do 20 percent in less than a time .
And not because they 're brilliant , not because they 're less diligent .
but why are they impensit , I 'm going to spot or not ?
" Would I should be saying later ?
They 're interrogative .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this implies , and not get a beautiful vote to my exame .
And they really have to do that . They 're very important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , as Carl Sarl , because the technology allows us to work every day , every day , from every day , from every day , transpent of the planet , transpent from Hotel Randolphy-olding .
And in parently , there 's a angle , and I don 't tell you what , where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this incredible freedom of choice that we have about the work ? It 's continuously decide , and we 're going to keep , and if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our child playing , with the cell phone , the mobile phone in a tank , the Blackberry in the other , and the notetetebook , the ginocky .
And even though they 're all spent , every minute we see our child rovinate the game , we 're also asking , " I have to answer to this called ? "
" I have to say that email ? I 've got to habits ? "
And even when the answer is " no , all this makes the experience of your child 's game very different than than they were in other conditions .
So , from any part of the look at , little bit , and big things , the lifestyle , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Obutter , there were some possibilities , but not all was a choice .
The world today is it looks like this : The dilemma is , " Is it a snail ? "
The answer is , the answer is .
The positive slies we all know , so I 'm going to talk about the negative ones .
All this choice company two negative effects of people .
The first one , paradoxally is that produces instead of liberation .
With many options that choices the choice , becomes very difficult to do it .
I 'm going to give you a significant study of volunteeth plans of voluntary pensive .
A colleagues had access to the Vanch data , the giant society of the source of the source of the source of the source of the source of the Vanch companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of the adesion , the exion of two percent .
With 50 sources , there 's 10 percent of adesions in less than the respect to the time they are available . Why ?
Because with 50 source of whose choose , is maledly difficult to decide , and the choice is remaining .
And I 'm asking , and again , questions , questions , and of course , and of course , and I wouldn 't get .
You know that it doesn 't only mean that these workers are going to mangathering food for cans because they 're not going to have enough money , it also wants to say that the decision is so ostic that they 're allowed the source of the work of the dator dator .
They 're not to participating , they 're lost to five dollars for the year from the work dator of work , which would be bad to be bad .
So the paralysis a consequence of the choices .
And I think it 's going to make the world .
" And finish , for eternity : ketchup , senapes or maionese ? "
You just want to take the decision , if it 's for eternity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the cut sourced , and you nepurpose the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can actually avoid paralysis , and do a choice , at the end , we 're not satisfacts from the result of how we would choose .
And that 's for different reasons .
One of these is that you have a lot of conditivegetables , and it 's not perfect , it 's very easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that you could do a different choice that would be better . And what happens is better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us industry , and the reduce the squeeeeer-ced ,
And even when it was a good decision .
More choice are , the easier is easy to be dispilevered than any detailable option of the choice .
And there is what economists call the opportunity .
Dan Gilbert asked a very well stamatic statement as the value we 're depends on what we 're comparison .
In the rest , when there are a lot of options , it 's easy to represent the characteristics of the option that is choices and be fewer than the option that option is choice .
Here 's an example . I have all the ones that are not New York .
But it 's what you probably think about it .
There 's this cople to the Hamptons .
A place of lussilly .
It 's bedded . Oten days . It 's all about them .
Not . But what he thinks is , " Well , malth , malth , it 's Agofgod . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan is . "
" I could talk about front of home . "
And it 's two weeks , the chance of the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The opportunity diminuges the satisfaction for what we have , even when the choice was old .
And the more are the options that we have to look at , the more characteristics action .
Here 's another example .
This vignized us a lot of things .
It talks about the moment , and maybe slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you 're choose , you choose to do , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
The things that we don 't choose are many active attractive active that can make less attractive things that we do .
Third point : it 's growing the expectations .
I tried to my skin bought a new couple of jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were only one of the slide , they bought them and besty , they were dissil , just after having them a life and sleeping a lot of times , they started to go well .
So , I went to buy a new when the old old old old old old old baded , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cuts . "
The commit told me , " He wants to slim , easy fit , relaxed ? "
Do you want to the cernight , or with the bottons ? "
" Do you want to be strapted ? "
" Sotto them want to the ball , you know , the blue .
I was sitting , and after a little bit , I was able to say , " I want the kind of -- which was the only kind of " " I want you to all of the jeans , so for a hour jeans , and then I went out of the jeans , and then I had the best couple of jeans that I had ever had .
It was the whole choice . With all the choice I had got the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand that .
The reason I was going to be perfect .
I was waiting the beginning . I didn 't expect anything except when there was only a kind of a kind . But when I saw 100 different , floor , hundred , hundred , at least a kind of thing .
What I was buy was bud , but not perfect .
After I had compared that chosen with what I was trying to insoddissatisfied in the expectations .
The addition of options in life of people don 't do that increases that these have respond to the options of the options of the options .
And that will produce less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing if you realize it .
Because if they knew , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth more like this .
" It was better when you were worse , " The reason the worst they were better when you were worse , it was that when you were worse , it was still possible to met the surprised .
The day , in the world we live in -- opulents , industrialized citizens with the expection of the perfefefefeature .
You never have surprised pleasures because your expectations , you 're ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse waitable " Shand , " Yes , you want . "
I mean , small autobiographic mofe -- which is really sposed and my wife is really study .
I wouldn 't have to do better , I don 't have accounted .
But it 's not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of the comprare a couple of jeans when you 're just the kind of jeans is that when you 're not satisfied , and you say , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? "
The world is the responsible . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a insoddisfaced , and you ask you who is responsible , it 's altreasy , it 's very clear that responsible responsible responsible , you 're .
You should have done better .
With hundreds of available variety , there are no wildlife .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is walked is walked , and they give the bad to them .
In the last years , the depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this honate depression is just that people have a depression of depression is because the standard experiences because the standard standard .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the collected is they think that the colcollege is they .
So the final result is that we 're better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the officer , what we all take for good and it 's completely false . It 's not true . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than haven 't affect it , but it doesn 't really have a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been enough enough that we 've been on a piece of the level where the improvement choices are improvement .
Now , from the political point -- I 've almost finished -- from political view , the nocce .
What allows you all this choice in industrial society is the material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , the problem isn 't they too much choice .
The problem is that they have too much .
So the face I 'm talking about is a disease of modern , recognized society .
And what does deprimly and arrand is this : Steve Levitt talked about how those expensive and discovers for biggers are inuseful . It 's a sprules . It 's a sprules . It 's a spake of money .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dispenous , it 's not just inuseful .
They 're admitty .
They do it stay .
If a little bit of what in our society allows were reversed in those where people have too poor few possibilities , not just the lifetime , it wouldn 't just be their lives .
That 's what economists call a pareting improvement .
A redistribution of the redent is good at all -- not just to the poor because of this choice in excess that you go back .
To conclude , " Look , you can become everything you want ,
You , people of culture , you 're thinking , " What does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get it into a glass . "
" A imagination castrated , a limited vision of the world , "
And I 've been interested in this , at the beginning .
But then , think , instead , I realized that the weight of the site .
Because the reality of fact is that if you 're sent in frantums , so that " all you can 't get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the bocket in a way that everything can decrease .
You 're going to get the paralsssycle , you 'll reduced the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too much , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the assumption of some symbolic symbolic symbolic sphere is a recipe for infecity .
Thank you very much .
