I showed this year I showed these slides to show that the glacial calots , which for almost three million years had had the size of the United States continental , and it 's refit from 48 percent .
But this subjected the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice spending ice .
The artics of the artics is , in a sense , the heart of global climate system .
You winter expands and winter reverse .
The next slide is going to be a quick carrot on the last 25 years .
The ice perennia have signed in red .
As you see , they expand to the blue , you can see .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is summer .
You can see that the ice cosidgn , along five years or more , is like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood , and the body smoke .
In 25 years , it was been so , in 25 years ,
This is a problem because the warming of the ice that the ice ice ice land around the ocean , where there are enormous amount of coal coal congeled that , slip , they come to transform into the microbes .
I respect to the totality of the atmospherical totality , the amount of global warming , superate this point of not coming back .
In some deep laghs in Alaska , the metane is already bulating on the water .
The professoresse Katey Walter of Alaska was recently lay with a team , and I took a team , with a team , and I took a team .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You 're good . The question is if we 're going to be .
A reason is that this termal exchange surrive Greenland from the north .
This is a glacial river river .
The brought her had never reached similar .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the southwest of Greenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea level of ice , here is where you reach the sea .
These corrate corrups are increasing rapidly .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctartica , the biggest blob .
The last month last month , the scientist came out that the ice of ice is in negative , and the Antarctarctarctica , which is particularly rapid islands , and particularly fasterly in the islands .
Equitself at six meters of the level of the actic of the hundred feet in Greenland .
On Himalayas , the largest blob block , you see new laghi , which was a few years ago , that a few years ago were glacier .
40 percent of the world 's population will be population half of the water as a melify from the melist .
Sululle Ande : this ice is the source of the population of this city .
The brought it is increased .
But when it depress , the same happens to the popular water .
In California , the snow on Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The drink water crisis in crisis .
Pease , as you read , they 're free .
The growing secure increasing in the world 's wind increasing the incends .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm out of the normal and without precedented .
Four times more numerous times in the last 30 years I respect 75 .
This is a whole thing that 's kind of sustainable .
If you look at it in historical context if they can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 24 million tons in the ocean every day .
Look attention to the Eastern Pacific , from the Americas , to the west , and both of the subcontinent , where there 's a radical impoor of the inininspiring oxygen in the ocean .
The major global warming , together to deforestation , and the deforestation use of fossil fuel use of fossil fuels .
Oil is a problem , and coal is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with more emissions , together at China .
And he was proposed to build a lot of coal other coal power .
But we 're seeing a change of direction .
These are the annoulbed projects in the last few years and some projects of some versus .
And anyway , there 's a political fight in our country .
The coal industries and the oil industry have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote coal the clean , which is a obxymer .
And this image of this picture --
I 'm Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion gallons of coal baby .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second largest flow of scories in America .
It happened around Natal .
The nature natalize of one of the coal industries was this .
Video : With carbon , it 's a carbon is a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it growth our economy .
Frosty carbon is more and more published .
It 's good price , adorable and workers keep the styptic .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest ministrator in the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reesday -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima 's Protection launched two campaiged campaiged two campaiged .
This is a part of them , one part .
Video : At : At COALergy see the climate change as a serious threat at at our business .
So our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a publicitary amount of money in a public and confused the truth and confused the truth .
In fact , coal is not sporting .
We think it 's published -- it also has a good smoke .
So not preocupateves of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Carbone : Carbone , you heard a lot of it .
So let 's take a turn in a structure at the time , and it 's about the coal published .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noious , but this is the sound of the coal technology .
The coal consumption is between the main warming crucial warming , but the remarkable technology , but the night technology of coal warming .
You look at a look . This is the hatest technology of the clean .
Al Gore : Finally , the positive alternative connects to economic and the national security .
Video : Comvil : The America is in the crisis ; the national security , the national security .
The flows that the lines all of us : our dependence on fossil fuel and oil .
Now , there 's a new audence , there 's a new audace solution for it .
Repower America : 100 percent clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work , make sure , make sure us more safe , and help stop global warming .
It 's inally , a solution that you 're going to solve our problems .
Repower America . Scoan more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Comvil : It 's about reining energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to get at the end of the dependence of the combustible commodity that killed our planet .
What 's the future is here . I 'm going to do , only a new energy network .
What do you do with the two : Novi investment for baby retribute .
Comfi: America . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A vast African proverbial African says , " If you want to fast , you go to the alone .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
I did this last year at TED , I did an introduction on LHC .
And I promise to travel to return out to how the car works .
So here I am . And for those that the other time there were not , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever -- 27 kilometers of circuit .
His task is to remember the conditions that were present less than a billion second of the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
That 's just a great environment .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
We photographed these mini-Bang Bang in the refurther .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- it 's a 44 meters and it has a 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions .
The 10 September 10 last year we have access the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because of immense to draw in the control room .
It 's a picture of the first particles that had made all the turn of the LHC , entering in collision , with a part of the LHC , and spreading particles into the retreatment .
In other words , when we saw that image 10 , the September 10 , we found that the machine worked , which is a great victum .
I don 't know if this was this to be exultended to get us more or this , when someone went to Google and saw the beginning was this .
That means we have had a cultural impact beyond that scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , because of the dorate sances here -- these dored dorate sange .
These files lead 13,000 printing when the machine works at the massive of power .
Now , the technicians between you look at the books and they 'll say , " It 's not true . I 'm too subtle . "
And they can do that because when they 're very cold sy-by-to-in-slide cold slope .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a time time temperature that of the space between the stars , these floor stars , these files can bring that corrate .
In one of the guns between the most novemile magnetic in LHC , there was a fect of fectory .
So the floor fill is about about , and the 13,000 printing sudden electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnetic fish more than 20 tons , and that have been moving about 30 centimeters .
They 're damaged about 50 magnetic .
We had to take them , what we have done .
We have restined them and adjusted .
Now they 're now going back all of their place to their place .
And then it was the end of the LHC is going to be again integrate .
We 're going to accind , and we wait to get to right now or bluy , and we continue our adventure to find out what the morons are are constitude the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents reaccess to the value of science and engineering in science and engineering in frontier .
I think that 's so hard to go beyond the fact of going on the limits , I think that 's the value of things like the LHC .
I want to end with the words of a Ingan scientist , Humphrey Davy Davy , which , imagine , in defense experiments of his puple , Michael Faraday , he said , " Nothing is so dangerous for the mind of human mind as a record of the human mind as a record of human mind as a record that science is not a very dangerous , that there are not in nature , and the triffense to our monstry , and that we don 't have a totune to be complets .
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to think about how , from children , play with kids , play with the moroncins .
And you get to understand how to reach them and take them and take them and get them , and you get them and move , and learn about problems and resolving problems and manipulating relationships .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , inspired information by the uslity of our physical interaction with physical objects , with my consulting Patts , and my collaborator Jeevevevan Kalanithi , I started asking : " And if we use a computer , instead of having only a computer polar like a digital polar willness that moves on a desktop information with both hands ,
and sistemle to sist-pleasure ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer interactive , like a bic computer interactive .
In a few words , a Siftable computer interactive , like a bic computer interactive .
You can move with his hand , they can see , they can see , " in their own , you feel the movement and they have a radio and a radio wireless and a radio weless .
But most phamount , I 'm physical objects , you can just move it to simply take it .
Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem for manipulate the digital information .
And as as as it as more physical conscious , conscious of their movement , and as they become more physical conscious , of the own movement , of how we move , we can explore new and fun interaction .
I 'll start with some simple example .
This Sift-hand is configurated to show the video : if it 's in a direction , the video is going to be like this , if they including the other side back .
These are interactive reacts are conscious of other .
If I face them , you 're interested in what they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they come around , they notice it and they can act a little bit .
If they come around , they notice it and they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power of the data , for example , " to " a color " " " a color like it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurated as a seck of vernice and I can use them to take the color in that in the middle , where they mix .
and I can use them to bring color in that mix , where you mix .
If we 're not too much , we can put a little bit of it .
They 're also beautiful possibility to learn , like languages , the math and games where people can try to try and fastern the results , and see the results immediately .
Now I 'm --
This is a Fibonacourselves 's sequence that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a word play that is half between Scarabean and Boggle .
Pratically , at every turn into a letter of case in every Siftable in every Siftable , Pratically , at every turn into every Siftable in , and while trying to understand words him on a dipactable .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you get a new set of reading and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came up with the Media Lab , I did so that they tried them and I took a video .
They are very much .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people a lot of education .
You just say , " Compons of words , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's how other people that try it .
This is our younger header header , there on the right .
It really wanted to impilate them .
They were only wind the morning , for him .
Now , this is an application of a cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of the languages .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving the Siftable them .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving the Siftable them .
So , it 's doing it 's doing it .
Video : The sun is source .
David Merrill : Now he 's brought a treator in the scene .
Video : The treatment .
I work ! Yeah ! Yeah !
So I school at Siftable and put them close to interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
and by inventing their own story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him how it comes .
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him how it comes .
Video : For , throw .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool , realized of the pinch , to walk and exececececk music .
It 's a tool , realized of the recently , to walk and execececture music .
The Siftable here are growing from sound here , low and the battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what we use .
You can also insert these sounds in a sequence to buy your pleasure .
And it 's just to make it touching a sound and a sequence .
These are effects that you can control from the vive , like the reverbs and the filter .
The attacks at a particular sound and then including it .
And then there are the effects as time and fly , and they fly , and they apply to the entire sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : DM : We 'll start putting a base in two Siftable Siftable in " sequence , we add the base , add other base .
Now I put a bat a bottom line .
Video : DM : Now I add some percussions --
Video : And I 'll put the battery to the bacteria , so I can control the effect of the vive .
Video : DM : DM : I can quencing the entire sequence inclinking the time , and from one side .
Video : And I 'm going to add the filter at the low to get more expression .
Video : DM : DM : I can recombine the flight .
So I didn 't have to plan it first , but I can improvised , make it longer or more cord .
And now , finally , I can move the entire sequence the entire sequence inclinating the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new message of moving human mention to how our brain and the body works .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this pattern , and also a few possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that it 's coming this new generation of projects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk with all of you .
I 'm a writer .
I 'm writing books my profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also the love and my love of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , I said this , something particular happened in my life and in my own career , who led me to recently recently recently recently , I 'm going to realibrate the entire recently recently ,
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biographiy called " Manogy , Prega , Ama , " which , diversity from my previous books , for some reason that I came out in the world and became a big sensational , baddress , wild interational .
And the result is that everywhere I go , people treat me as if I was convicted .
It 's true -- convicted , convicted , convicted .
They 're going to be all concerned and say , " Don 't you fear to do better ?
You 're not fear to continue to write for all life without being able to create a book that can important someone ?
What can it important someone ?
It 's rassure , you know .
But it could go worse , except that I remember the 20 years ago , when I started saying to people -- I was a adolescent adolescent -- I was a writer .
I walked up to the same reaction as the same as well .
And people say , " Don 't temes I couldn 't do that ?
Don 't you fear that the humiliation of killed ?
You 're not fear to do this inexive for all life without that nothing is ever outside and die on a cumulation of a dinfrants with the baby of fallish with the bad dinner burn of failure ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the brief response to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yeah , I have achievement of all those things .
I 've always had afraid of it .
And I have also achievement of many other things that people might not have to have .
As the algaining and other things .
But , for how to write that I thought and wonder , and I was wonderful ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone who has to wait to be spavented by a work that you feel .
But what is there is so particularly in creative impress us nervous about the health health health health and a way that other career not ?
How did my father , for example , he was a chemistry and I don 't remember a only remember in his 40 years of activity where the was asked if he had fear to be engineer ?
And it was never -- that block of the engineer John , how does it go ?
Don 't work like this , you know ?
Onestly , chemical engineers like group don 't certainly , in the secoli , driven the reputation of being handed maniaci depressed .
We have this writers , we have enough reputation , and not only writers , but creative of every gender , we have this reputation of being enormously unstable mentally .
And I 'm not going to look at the sad of the magnificent deaths , only in the 21st century , they died young and often for them .
And those who are not suicipate they seem to be real dissfaced by their dames .
Norman Mailer , before I die , in the last interview said , " Every my book has killed me a little more " an extraordinary affermation about work .
But we don 't bad bad bad digm , when we feel that we 've heard these things that we 've completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are somehow read and suffering are somehow reading and art , at the end , it will be during the annotion .
And the question I want to get all of this idea is , are you agree with this idea ?
It 's good for you , because even look at it 's a centimeter from a centimeter distance to me not good for anything this suppose .
I think it 's hate .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encourage our great creative minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start fire out at the purpose of supposed , most circumstances in which I 'm in my career .
That 's really -- I 'm looking at , they 're pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I 've got about 40 years .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that whatever I write about now , it 's going to be juddled by the world as a work that I went out with my last book .
I 'm going to be square , because we 're all more or friends here -- is likely that my greatest success is my wild .
Oh , Gesus , who think !
You know this is the kind of thinking about it is the kind of thinking about nine and start to get a gin the nine morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep going to continue to do this work we love .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflectionary reflection , that the way to work to continue to write is to create a psychological costruct , OK ?
I had to make a security distance of me , which I 'm wrote , and my natural natural anxiety on which is going to get there . And , as I was trying for all the scale year , trying to find other society to see whether they could have the best ideas and healthy .
about how to help people make creative people to manage the inherent inherent inherent people in creativity .
And that research me to the ancient Grece and ancient Rome .
Seem because I 'm circle and then back .
In the ancient Grece and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity was from men , OK ?
And it was thinking about creativity was this spirit look at the divine and that was from men from a few sources and unknown , for the distant and unknown .
The Geeeeeeek these spirits of creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a demon that elargives wisdom from the distance .
The Romans were the same idea , but they called that a kind of spirit without a genius .
That 's great , because the Romanii didn 't really think that a genius was someone particularly intelligent .
They thought a genius was a genius of a divine that created was literally in the walls of a artist , a little bit like the elfer 's work , a little like the elfo Dobby , and that came out to be able to hire the work of the artest and modeling the outcome of that work .
It 's the distance of -- here 's the distance of which I talk about -- that 's the psychological costruct that protected you from the results of your work .
And everyone knew that was how it worked , right ?
So the anti-to-certain artists , as for example , as the too narcisism , right ?
If your work was exceptional job , you couldn 't take it all the goods , all of the way that was helped by this genius .
If your failure job , it wasn 't all your , right ?
They all knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people han conceived creativity in Western Western for a long time .
Then Renascisance came and everything changed , and nacves this big idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe on all the mistery and without leaving space and no longer leaving space to wrote the devices of the devices and wrote from divinity .
This was the rational humanity 's principle and people began to think that creativity was completely from the ished idividate .
And for the first time in history , he started referired at this or that artist as a rather than one person with the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think it 's allow someone , a simple person to believe that you can be like a recient as a recipient as the source of all of mysteries , creative , unknowledge of the human psychc , a race of human-hand a raise responsibility for the psychc fragile human .
It 's how to ask someone to inguiate the sun .
It 's a completely destroy and creates all these inextremendous unexpectable on .
And I think it was this pressure that was destroyed the arts in the past 500 years .
And if this is true , and if that is , and I think that 's the question , and now ?
Can we do it fun ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and creative .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there is probably people between the audience that would solleave suspected suspects on the notion of , insometimes , you do that follow , or failure , and they 're going to be doing their projects .
I 'm probably not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I 'd like to get is -- why not ?
Why is not thinking about this way ?
Because it 's more sense of everything that I 've ever heard to explain the exasperformance of the creative process of the creative process .
A process of process , as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so , all here -- all of course , all here -- you know , you don 't understand rationally .
And in fact , it can sometimes it looks completely paranormal .
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poetetesse Ruth Stone , who has now 90-year-old , but it was a poetetetetetetetetetetetetetc , worked out in the rural childhood , and she was hearing out in the rural childhood , when a poexithout of the landscape .
He said he was like a fragorous air train .
And that was rotling to her from the landscape .
It was going to come , because he was so throwing the land under his feet .
He knew you had a only thing to do at that point and it was , words , " run like a math . "
And so he raised back home and he wouldn 't have to make it more than take a paper and a match and a match and a fairly enough , as the translate , and he would take it and take it and deal on the page .
Sometimes he couldn 't be fastly fastonishing , and it would run without able to get into the house and and the poetry the round was through and she would keep her and perdeployed and wild up through the landscape , searching , and he would go to the landscape through the landscape , and he would go to the house through the landscape , and she would keep her and slow the rotated and walked up with her and performance and wild her and wild the rote
Then there were those times -- this piece I won 't forget -- there were moments where it was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running house and he was trying to paper and the poetry was going through , and he was saying a match right in the while he was going to switch through , and then he said , " He was like saying , which was like if you sat it with the other hand and the coffering .
And he was willing the poem from the tail and put it in his body and turned it on the page .
And in these cases , the poem was introduced on the perfect page and it 's about but on the last word at the first .
So when I thought -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly equal at my creative process .
I 'm not a creative process -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a mule , and my work is a way to work is ; you wake up to the same time and go and go go go and go go go and go go go and go go go and go go go and and go go go go and go go go and go go go and go go go go go and go go go and go go go go and go go go go go and go go go go and go go go go go and go go go and go go and go go go and and go go go and and go go and and go go and and go go and and go go go go go and and go go go go go and and and go go go go go go go
But even I even , in my head , I 've striked against that thing , sometimes .
And I think that many of you , even many of you , you know ,
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source I could not not yet .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it to it under a way that we don 't make us heads , but , rather , rather , that make us remain healthy , that 's doing it ?
And as I am , the best example of the contemporary example I have is the Tom Waits , which I have been interviewed for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of the life was the incarnation of the articity was the incarnation of the articularticar creative , dominate these kind of creative impulses .
But then he invention , he he got up , and one day as he was driving on a car in Los Angeles , he changed everything for him .
He was going to go fast and all of a sent tracks , this little bit of melody , which comes into his heads how the inspiration , electricity and straight , and it 's wonderful , and it 's wonderful , and it 's not how to take it .
It doesn 't have a paper , it doesn 't have a matine recording , it doesn 't have a craft .
So he begin to hear this kind of old anxiety growth in him , " I 'm going to lose it , and I 'll be obsessed by this song lope .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go into the panic , he stopped .
And he was going to be the whole mental process and he did something completely again .
And he just look at the sky and he said , " Scuses , you can 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" You know , " Do you know , a song now ?
If you really want to exist , back in a more opporting time when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you 're going to take someone else today .
You go to the Leonard Cohen . "
And his work process , he was changed after that .
I don 't work , the work still still was dark as well as it always .
But the process , and the fish that was that attornized was when the genius , the genius , the genius out of him that problems and fliberate it back to where they came from , to be doing it back where , to make it himself that wouldn 't be an interized and tormented .
but it 's very well , this became bizarre collaboration in Tom and this strange of Tom and this strange thing and external that although it was not Tom .
So how much the story started changing a little bit the way I worked and I was saved and I already word and I was saved .
This idea , I was writing when I was writing " Manogy , Prega , Ama , " and fall in one of those cave out of the disperation where we 're working on something and we don 't and we 're going to start thinking that will be a disaster , which is going to be the worst wrong .
Not only bad , right , right the worst written .
And I started thinking about guns this project .
But then I remember he was talking about the air and I tried to do it .
So I got my face in the manubuts on the manubuts and my common corner corner corner .
And I said to high voices , " Sent , what do we know that if this book won 't be interacted , not going to be interacting my , no ?
Because as I see , I 'm paying all I 'm paying , I don 't have that .
So if you want to be better , you have to present , and make your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know , I don 't do it .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to please that was recorded that I 've been presented to do my part , " Because it 's so , OK -- in the end of North Africa 's deserts for the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle of the middle and hours to the high hours .
And they were always magnificent , because the ballerini were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every one of them rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became was actually transendent .
And I know you know what I talk about , because I know you have seen it , at some point , at some point , a performance like .
It was like the time stopped , and the dance ballerin the dance of a bad wasn 't doing anything different from the usual , like the 1,000 nights before , but all of them , it was sitting .
And suddenly , not appeared as a human .
But you accurate from the divinside and under the fire in the fire of divinity .
And when this was in the template , people knew what was , they called him her name her name .
They knew the hands and began to start canting , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God . "
That 's God , you know .
Curious known -- when the More invaded the southern of Spain , I took this habits and pronouncy changed in the coos by " Allah , Allah , Allah , " Ols , " " Ols , " " that you can hear in the round or in the flamp .
In Spain , when an artist has done something impossible and magic , " Allah , " words , " Allah , " By , magnific , " old , " incomprehensy -- a God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But the problem is the next day , for the dance , when you woke up and find out that they 're the 11 of the morning of Martedu and they won 't have .
It 's just a dead-to mortal with ginocked the ginocked , and maybe it 's going to be able to make that alteeth .
And maybe no one will square name of God still as it goes , and what does it have to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard to do it .
This is one of the most painful recognition to make a creative life .
But maybe it has to be so angoal of being so angoal , if you can 't believe , lung , the most extraordinary aspects of your own being coming from yourself .
But you just believe that they 're going to be prested by a unimaginable source of this squisite part of your life that you have to get someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think that 's what it changes changed .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly like this , and it 's a few months in the work of the book I 'm going to public , spapers , spectacing , and I was very , extremely , and I was a very , extremely , and I was a very , and I 'm certainly like this .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel elected by this is , not having afraid .
You don 't get to go . It 's just your work .
It 's involua present for your part , whatever can be .
If your work is dancing , balls .
If the divine , assurd genius to make decide to leave up a few kind of wonder , for a moment through your effort , for only a moment through your efforts , then , " Ole ! "
Otherwise , you do the same dance .
And " Ole ! " " at yourself .
I think I 'm going to teach it .
" Ole ! " at yourself , even for the human love and headed testardaggin and headed tells to give you you you a continuously .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And as you know I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what 's going to mean , and the discovery of new genes .
Now we 're starting a new way : We started to digitalize biology and now begin to digitalize biology and now beginning to a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We always try to get big questions .
" What is life ? " is something that many biologists I think they 've been trying to understand drawling lights .
We tried different approaches , reduced it back to the terms .
We are digitalizing for almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analog world in the digital world of the computer .
Now we ask us : can we regenerate life , or create new from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genitalium genitalium that can autorem into lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome of creating the genome to create one more smaller .
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of the way I 'm here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes we can eliminate , one at a time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring to a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to progrew was synthesize this chromosome that we can modify to get the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
So we started the " adventure of " Poo we can synthesize a cromosome ? "
It can be the chemistry control of provide that we never could make before we make it ?
And , in case , can we make a cromosome , can make a cromosome ?
A cromosome is simply a chemist of chemistry material .
The speed with which we 're able to digitalize the life is growing at the exponential .
Our capacity to write the genetic code , instead of prodiscs rather slowly , but it 's improve .
And our most recent results that they take on a exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process requires rement requires , beginning with a bioetic review before we begin the first experiments .
But we found that that synthesize that DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that make small segments of DNA , the longer of 30 to 50 letters and it 's a degenerative process : the longer segment is long , the more errors .
So we had to develop a new method to assembly lay these broadly and raise the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , starting to start digital information genome of Phi X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills kills .
We designed the fragments , effectively the correction of errors and I had a molecule of DNA of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this chemistry of chemistry material and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and product the viral particles .
The viral particles have been required by the cells , they 're back and destroyed the E. coli .
I talked about recently recently with a members of the oil industry and they certainly realized this model .
They have remember more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where software can actually build his hardware in a biological biological system .
But we wanted to do things bigger in big big .
We wanted to build the whole battery of the bacteria .
They 're over 580 miles reading genetic code .
So we thought about building it in the size of the virus , so that we can change the cassets of the virus , so that we can change the components of a living cells .
The design is critical design , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequence this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard accuracy was a mistake for every 10 miles .
We found , resequence it , 30 mistakes . If we had that original sequence . If we had that original sequence we would never be able to work .
One of the process is designing 50 reading segments that are overwhelming segments with all the other segments of 50 reading to be able to make subunity undergrounds that work together .
We try to give one of them unique here .
Probably you have read that we put that we put on the physical figure out .
Think it so : We have a genetic code based on four reading : A , C , G and TG and TG .
Three of those reading together code about 20 lots , and there 's a specific order to be able to each of each of the blind for every adminoacid .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , sentences , psys .
What we did in the beginning was autograped to do .
Some were delivered by the fact that it wasn 't poetry .
We designed these segments to just give them together .
There are enzing them and put them together and put them care .
And we started assembling to assembling some parts , beginning with seven miles , and they sat at a seven miles , and they 're going to be able to make a segments of 24 miles reading to get 72 thousand until them to get 72 thousand miles .
And we have a step in abundance , so we made these sequence in abundance so that we 're trying to create a extremely robustood -- like you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatizing the process .
So , this seems like the tabellon of a basketed playoff .
When we get to these very long segments , over 100 thousand , over 100 thousand , they 're not going to grow more directly in the Ecoli .
You go to the modern limit of the modern biology .
So we looked at other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination , which in biology , which is in biology to repair the DNA can bring the DNA can bring the segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , it can absorry three million rad rad rad rad .
You can see in the superior as his chromosome of his chromosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms are completely telling completely .
They can live under a vacuum .
They 're absolutely certainly that life exists in space , and you 're going to find new environments of water .
In fact , NASA showed that this is going to have .
This is a picture of the molecule that we 've built using these processes , simply using the least design with the segments of insery .
The least assemble them is automatically .
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It 's a very big molecule that we can see it with a law microscope .
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the advertising we did a little time ago .
They 're over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined structure that man ever created by man .
It 's got a 300 million high high high millions .
If we 're going to get a caratter 10 without spaces , it would like 142 pages , it would like 142 pages to track this genetic code .
Now , how do we do that ? How do we take it ?
Obviously , you love a virus is a game young kids .
It 's a little more complicated when they use the bacteria use .
It 's also simpler when it 's eucarious as we 're eucarious as our : You can just extractly extract the nucleus and put another , which is practically the clonation process .
In the bacteria , the bacteria chromosome is instead of integrated in the cell , but we 've been demonstrated that we 're able to make a beautiful transplant transplant transplant of a cell of a cell of a bunch of a cell of a bad cell , but we 've recently degree .
We can have a cromosoma is starting from a microbial species .
The two are different as men as men from men .
We added some gene in more way that we could decide that choose for this chromosome .
And then he slight-with the environment in a way that they 're killing all protein .
And when we put it in the cells was study -- and you 're appreciate our sophisticatomic graphic graphic graphic -- the new cell cell .
And we started thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we 've tried anyway .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that many species have added species have added a second or a third cromosome of , adding new tracks in a thousands of new tracts to that species .
So who think about evolution as only as a gene at the time that is not understanding a lot of biology .
And there is a restraight enzymes that address are going to digm that they 're going to be digital DNA .
The chromosome that was in cells , you know , you know ,
The cell phone we have to cell phone that we inserite it has .
And they 're expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as a material , has masticated , and we were returned with only the cells and the new cromosome .
It 's blue because of the gene we have insered .
And in a brief lash of time , all the characteristics of a species , and it turned to be transformed in a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cells .
All proteins are changed , membranes are changed , and when we read the equivent genetic code exactly what we 've been transfed to what we 've transfed you .
Now , this may seem to be genetic , but we 're getting the software DNA , we can change things in a way way way .
Now , I 've already explained that here is not talking about genesis -- but for progress to go from three and a half million years of evolution , and I 've already said that maybe to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian explosion of the digital explosion of the digital process .
Why do that ?
I think that 's obvious when we think about our necessity .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people at nine billion in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 ; there 's going to be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicinal and gas for six billion people .
It 's going to be more training to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion coal bunch , over 30 billion oil bets .
That means millions of baries a day .
When we try to find biologist , or whatever of the process process of process them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep all the hemiddle of CO2 from these materials that ends in the atmosphere .
And I 'm in the scientific discovered all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they are designed for the future .
The electronic industry only has a dozen about components , and think about how many different things are coming out .
Our limits here is a major limits here , by the imagination data .
Now we have techniques , thank you very much as a quickly of synthesization , that can create what we call combinatory genomics .
We 're able to build a big robot that can make a million cromosomes that can make a million cromosomes a day .
Think of processes or these 20 million genes or to get optimize the processes of proach or baby , new vaccine vaccine or drugs , we can change , through a small team , and create more biology that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for a chance of survival , production , chemistry or fuel , production of vaccine .
This is an instantaneous instantaneous instantaneous instantaneous instantation of the computer programming and design species to the computer .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how they 'll be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
Now we 're focusing on the fuel of fourth generation .
You also saw you that extract ethanol from the grate was a evil finished experiment .
We have a couple of second and third generation that they 're going to be on the couple of higher value than value as the eight-couple of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increase that we have a big impact of food and limited the cost of food and limited the disponeering is going to transform CO2 in matter , where we 're working for for design , for which we 're working for design cells that can achieve this , and we think we can have the first carbons of the generation in about 18 months .
The sunlight sunlight with CO2 is a metodo-methodos -- but in our discoveries around the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the ocean , about 2500 feet of depth of the water temperature of the water temperature .
They recently metane from CO2 , using molecular hydrogen as energy source .
We 're trying to understand if we can incanalate CO2 , which can easily be translated by the tubes , convert that CO2 in the fuel , to drive this process .
So , in brief we think we can be able to increase what is the basic question of what is life is . " And we have the basic modity -- we have the goal of reduce the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where can you ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And we 're working on using the same methods to use the same methods to create instantaneous vaccine .
You saw this year with the influence , we 're always back of a year and a dollar in less when it 's about trying to find the vaccine .
I think that 's going to change building vaccines combines in ancient adable .
This is how the future can start to look at changing , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating the evolution with bacteria , and archy , and finally , and finally finally cellubrate eucariote .
We are so far as the best people .
Our purpose is to do a long enough to live long enough to try and make it . Thank you very much .
So , I 'll be going to see , the most quickly possible , some fundamental work , some fundamental work , some fundamental work , almost a year ago , exactly , exactly , almost a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment where you can interact with the local level that remote with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of digital gabyte pictures with a kind of sugabyte photos and continuous fast , for a panoramic , disponing the images how we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these are collected or images .
Most of them are digital photographs , but this is a scan from the Biooo of Congress , and restairs in the moment of 300 megapixel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on on your screen on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , example , not a data of data .
This is the Casa desolate Casa desolate Casa .
For show you that it 's just about textbooks and not images , we can do something like that , to really make a real thing of the connection , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little bit of an electronic book .
I don 't consider it .
This is a more realistic example . It 's about a number of The Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of a cartoon version of a magazine or a fifth of a fire or a neat , which is a lot of a half .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of The Guardian .
We created a higher advertising advertising -- much higher than that you use in a normal advertising -- and we put you in the extra farming .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see them here .
Or other models , or even the techniques .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to put up to the pop-up and the other porks like the pop-up and the other porks , not need to be necessary .
Of course , the mapping is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if not to say that we have the contributes to have in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , I think of NASA geospacacecraft .
So now we go to something else .
This is actually a view of the web ; you can go to see it .
This is a project called Photosyntholic , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual visual at the very interesting computer , made by Noah Snavely , a student of Washington , with Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve .
And it 's from the vive to the web , gested by Seadragon .
You can see that when we do this pattern , where we can go from an image to another and have this kind of experience and have this kind of experience in resolution .
But the space of the images here has actually a meaning meaning .
The high-visualization of the computer has recorded these images together , so that correspond to the real place in the real place in which the images -- all of these screamed taken to the Graddress in the Roccious Roccious canadesi-- they were taken . So , you see some of the elements of a slide-stable show . So , these things have been very level .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to spend directly one of the Noah-- and this is from a prototype of Photosynththeretotype of Photosynththree-sumer data . And it 's really the key such a cave behind this technology , Photosymptoxietic . And it 's not necessarily evident to look at the environments we put in the site that we put in the site that we put in the site .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of the catthedral of Notre . Dame pictures from Flickr . Baast digit . To you get Notre of these arancions in the magicians , other field of the shirt of the shirt of the shirt of the saying .
So they 're all picked up with Flickr and they were all colleaged to this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this way simple .
You know , I wouldn 't have thought about end up Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying to get this kind of acades here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different types of different photocameras : from those of the phones in the professional phones , in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try to look for those strange more .
Many are are block , etc .
Somewhere there is a series of photographs -- here it is .
This is a poster of Notre Dame recorrectly right .
We can move from the poster to the vision of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the such collective data from the entire memory of how earth , from visual visual -- and connects all of those data together .
All those pictures become linated , more than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the entire emerges .
Think about this as a proling of Stephen Lawler on the virtual Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as you can get people , and the advantages for people to use it , and the use of the use .
Their pictures are sea with insert methers by other people .
If someone is the idea of the idea of those data saying the name , my picture of Notre of the catthedral of Notre of the catthedral clearly from all of those data , and I can use it as a point of involved in that space , in that metaphimself in that metaphimself in that metaphimes , using the photographers of cross-moke cle-moe experience .
Of course , a consequence of all that are virtual models of any interesting part of the earth , collected not only from airplane and satellite images and satellite images and similar images , but from the collective memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software is that you 're going to do is that at a point , in the next few years , all the photographs from anyone in the entire world will be basically linked together ?
BAA : Yeah . What he 's doing is basically to find out .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , between the images .
And he 's doing it in the basis on content of the images .
And the thing becomes very interesting if you think about the rich of the semantic information that a lot of these images can be able to be .
And as you do a research of images on the web , you 're digital , and the textbooks has a lot of information about the pictures .
Now , what if that pictures you linking to all your pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection and semantic interconnection and the amount of rich is really huge . It 's a classic classic effect of the net .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main please , when you travel and one of the ethnographic pattern is the power of live in the wind who didn 't forget the anti-traditions , between the past , the past in , touch of the pink , and the pink in the stone , driving in the flies of the flip .
Basti thinking about the sciamani Jaguar travel even beyond the Via Lattea , or that the old Inuit 's still a significant model , or in Himalayas , the most of the major that in the major hyet , to remind the importance of the Dharma , to remind the importance of the world , and that the idea that the world that we live in in assume ,
the consequence of a particular set of adaptations that our own own style has done , well , many generations ago .
And of course , all sharing the essential tracts .
We all sorts of all .
We are subjects at the beginning of initiation .
We need to deal with the inexorability of death , so we don 't surprisingly and ballize --
We all have an art .
What hits is the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they 're the Penan 's forests of the Borneo , or the Vodoo Haiti 's Gerries , or the Kaisut 's desert Kenya Shya Sentries , or a cammas in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak of yak in the game valley in the Everest , the dead of the world .
All of these populations teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of mudddle in the world .
And if you reflection , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
Insit together , cultures of the world creating a spiritual renature and cultural life that has to be able to be the planet and it 's important for the well-being to the planet as a ragnature as a ragnature as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural ragnature as a cultural ethnosphhere and you can define the som of all of the concepts , dreams , inspiration , ideas , inspiration , inspiration , inspiration , inspiration , inspiring , inspiration ,
The ethnosphere is the patrimony of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how species .
And because the biosphere was a very quickly consumed as well as it was in the etnosfetnosfy and too , much more quickly .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species was or is on the horeeeem , because it 's false -- in the most apocalyptic exhypocalyptimic -- and you don 't even even pocaly-hypocalypocketches -- that of the cultural diversity .
The index of all that is , of course , the language of the language .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the shake of human spirit .
It 's the middle of every culture is coming in the material world .
Every language of a strength of mind , a bacin mind , a spiritual chance .
And those 6,000 languages , as we 're sitting in Monterey , at least half is not surrounded in the ears of the children .
They don 't get to teach children , which means , unless you won 't walk , unless you won 't walk ,
What is there is more sad than being the silence , the last thing is the last to talk a language , not to transmitted the wisdom of wisdom or to ancient the promise of children ?
This is a faim of some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks of the older is a child 's moving and brings with in the last last last syllabes of an ancient language .
And I know someone will say , " Isn 't it better ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we talk all of the same language ? " Bensim , then we talk all yorba . It 's a cancer .
Let 's talk kogi .
You 're going to cover a translator of what it means is not to talk about your language .
I 'd like to do you a journey through the ethnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosfhere to give you a little bit of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of existing really different ways of existing existing .
Let 's take for example , this Barasana , in Amazon , the baby popular , the popular of the anaconda , which creats the myth of the sacred floulder of snails .
It 's a popular that 's not able to distinguish the blue color from the green because the time is the celests is identified in the forest time , where the popular it dependent .
They have a strange language and a rule of matrimonished rule , " " " " " You have to marry a person who talk about different language .
All of that has radical in the past , yet the particularity is that in these extremely extremely , in those existed familiar with marriage .
They 're limited to hear and then they start talking to .
We take one of the most interesting tribe in which I lived , the Waorani of the Waorani Easter cuador a popular that has had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionaries have been trying to make a factor contact a made .
They did it displaced them that they had never seen a few of a pay-dimensional photographed , forest that this popular population had never seen a third of the pluvial forest .
They raised the pictures , they turn to the research of a form or a figure and , not finding nothing , they 've got to treat the direction , and they killed the five missionar with the lazing .
But the Waorani not only killed the strangers .
They killed in their own .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We are rising at eight generations and we found two natural cases and we found two natural household , and when we put them in the knowledge , they admit that was aging , and then they killed it with it .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal hurine from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the first ' 80s , I was assigned a very interesting task when my Harvard professor when my Harvard professor , I was assigned in the base of Guvalier 's power of Duvalier 's power of Duvalier 's power and Tonton Macoutes , and imming of the speaking of the wind .
To give a sense of miraculous sense , I would have to understand the Vodoun culture and that Vodoun 't the magic is not magic .
It 's pretty much of a complex metaphysical vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianesimum , Islam , Budddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has not religious faiths . And instead of these religious concepts . And instead of these religious concepts of these religious concepts in the saving tragic concepts in the slavery .
What makes the voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So the people do they 're born the spirits .
The spirits can be invited by Great Acqua , and they reply reply to the dance of dance and replace temporary that for a brief a way that for a brief across the way that for a brief actic is the goal .
So the voodooists say , " You 're white white the white vooes to talk about God .
We 're saying in the temple and divention .
And from the time you 're a little bit , is the spirit you 're doing the evening you , how can you do the evil ?
So you 're looking at these incredible events : follow voodoo in state of trance that touch committed tizes a rather demonstration rather than the body 's mind when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme , when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme extreme .
And in all the popular that I lived the most extraordinary are the Kogi of Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta , in Colombia section .
Each ancient civilization that once lived on the caraibic plane of Columbic plane in the attention to the conquest , the popular massive planning on the vulcanic mass that you erge on the caraic .
In a blood continent sweeted , this popular never been conquisted by the spagnology .
And now , they have governed by a clero , but their formation is decided to be extraordinary .
The young people follow are taken away from the families to three or four years , and they live in a good world and secreged in a good world and shadow in the base of the ice for the ice ice of ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , I 've been proposed to reproduce the nine months of gestation that spent in the user of the mother , they 're metaphorically in the Great Mother .
So , so , so they get acculturated to the values of their society , values that predict their predict and only their prayers keep the cost ealance -- or to say the balance equilibrium ef -- or to say the ecology .
At term of this incredible beginning , they 're sudden , they 're sudden , and for the first time in their life , at the age of the age of the first of consciousness , when the board ss of the beautiful standscape , when the sun is a beautiful valley , everything they learned in theory . It 's about a past . The push word is conster in all his splending . The please go back and says ,
" Vison ? I 'm like you .
It 's amazing . Now it 's going to protect it . "
They 're called the largest brothers and say we , brothers , are the colpiting of the destruction of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think about the ingene populations and the environment , we 're invote and the old story of the noble self-vages , which is a razy , in his simplicity or maybe Thoreau and say that we 're going to say that these populations are closer to us .
The popular popular indebate is not feeling from the nostalogy .
There 's no space for these things in the datory malaria in the Astfic or vent vines of the Tibet , but because of time and the ritual , they created a mystical mystical mystical intuition , but on a bunch of the most subtle of human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
It 's a mess of Ande that a kid of Ande that the mountain is a spirit . Apu he 's going to drive his destiny , it will be a destiny different relationship with the mountain or that place to be a very different relation-place , or that place to be a kid of Montana who grows that a little mess of Montana .
That 's the deal of a spirit or a mineral burden is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that define is the metaphor is the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Britannica credding that the forests service for the forests to be cut .
That made me a human being from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forestimate is the Hukukuk and the drug of paradise and the gadise of paradise and the down-to-world , spirits that live in the extreme in the beginning Hukey .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some their sensitive reality . We take this piece of the sensitions .
I took this picture to open in the Norororthern Amazon .
Mayahuash some of you have heard about the ayahuasca , the most powerful psychology of the sciamanic repertoilet .
What makes the ayahuash is not the phyhuasca potential of the substance , but his elaboration . It 's composed to two .
From a late side , this legacy that contains a series of beta-carboline , harmine , slightly slightly slightly .
Take the only plant is a blue that it 's a blue that alters a little consciousness , but it 's michoices with a blue of the family Psychototria redis .
This triple is triptamine , very similar to serotonin , methoxylyptamine-thoxy-methoxy-methoxy-to-methoxy-ftamine .
If you ever see Yanomami pull up for the nose of the sustained sustained a different set of species , anched methoxy-to-methoxyptamine .
And then you 're going to get that dust for the nose is a little bit like being disappeared by a pinches and land on a sea of electricity .
I had often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who took the psychedelic was psychedelic , with his discovery of fungi in the ' 30 in Mexico .
I 'm in my thesis not a classroom , you can 't be classified because if you 're not told anyone of being told .
It 's possible to absual them only if you 're just a little bit of chemicals that denaturate the MAO .
Now it 's a beautiful : the beta-carboline in-coothers , the same kind of MAO , the same kind of potential for the same type for a reptamines . The question is , in a 80,000 species of plants , how these popular popular popular son-based version of the parts , but if you combine in this way , create a biochemical version of biochemistry that is sometimes the sometimes ?
We use the great euphotos of the proof and error , which can reveal .
But if we ask the Indian , they 'll tell us , " The plants are talking about it . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , the 17 variety of ayahuasca , which is distingue that are nectely in the forest species .
If we asked him how they 're going to make their tasonomics say , " I was going to understand that of plants , you don 't know ? "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night of moon and each other is going to be a cancer with a different .
I don 't fall to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that contact stami to stay .
Now , it 's also the problem is that even those of us who have at heart popular popular heart popular popular but in some way to the sea history of the story in the real world , and pass .
In fact , the 19th century , between 300 years , it won 't reminded for the wars or its innovations , but rather like the technologies , but rather like the era where we stopped and abbrace actively passively or passively passively destruction of the planet . Now , the problem isn 't the change .
All cultures through the secoli have been involved in a dance for new life .
And the problem isn 't technology .
The Indian Sioux didn 't stopped to be Sioux when they put out of the arc and fets as Americans don 't stop being Americans when they put from the side and hot .
It 's not the change or the technology that 's integrity of ethnosfhere .
The fashion fly .
And if you look at the world , you 'll find out that these aren 't cultures are not cultures destined to disappear .
They 're living creatures and dynamics spints out of the identifable identifable and they go beyond their ability .
Which is disboscene in the Patria of the Penan --
a popular noy-in Sarak , in the Southeast , a popular popular who lived away away the forest to a generation , and now reduced to the servitu and prostitude to the servites of the rive , where you can see the floor of the rive . And then that looks like the navi . Borneo in the Merian Cinese , where navi navi the wills ,
ready to empires the standing wood with the forest wood .
Or in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that have come with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on the Tibet mountains of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of political research , you 'll see the hard of political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physical extinction of a popular , is convicted to universal level , but the ethnocide , the destruction of the lifestyle , not only is condition , but the destruction of the development of the development , because it 's part of the strategy development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet until you 're part of the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in China , in the West Cina through Tibet South , coming to Lhasa with a young link , but only came to Lhasa , I 've realized what 's behind is .
6,000 sacred monuments in polymuments and hold .
1.2 million people killed from the military during Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this kid was ascritical at Panchen Lama .
That means that it was killed to the template of Chinese invasion .
Her ununcle is further with Santity during the diaspora that 's led the popular in Nepal .
Her mother was impresoned and his color was rich .
It was brought to hidden in the age of two years , hidden under his gon because he couldn 't live without him .
And the sister , who did the same , was in reeducation camp .
One day he walked up a day , a fashion Mao and , for this transgression , was mitted to the washed washed for seven years .
The Tibet can be insopurable , but the rein the rein the rein the popular of the popular is to the popular .
And then finally , all reduced to a choice .
We want to live in the world monocromatc or we want to according the polymationic world or we want to across the poly-diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he died said that his biggest fear was that , in our gareas of the world , not only will see the whole gamma gareas of human imagination to a limited gartance of the thinking , but one day we 'll be swke up from a sleep .
And it 's umiliating our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Neolitical Rivolution , who gave us the agriculture , who did us sucler to the cult of the seed of the seed of the slightly slightly the poetry of the slightly of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has 300 years .
That quals a story not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we 're going to face into the millennia to come .
When these miric cultures of the world is asked what it means to be human , respond to 10,000 different voices .
And that 's in these answers that we all risk the possibility of being what we are are : a consciously known , which has to make all the people and all the garden ployed . And there 's great moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the norththrown of the island of Baffin , when I went to the balene hunting of the Inuit , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The canadly canadly was not always gentle with the Inuit and in the ' 50s to stage our premise , we raisy them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , I teached for his life , and he took them all the arms , and all his attackage .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't teach cold , they 're framing the cold ,
The bad bunch of the bats were made of cartoon the skin .
The grandfather of this man didn 't intimise from the arctic or or the library that he was suffering .
It 's gained , it 's hot the pantalone bits in skin and defected in your hand . When the focused , they 've been congelated , she worked by creating a moama .
He 's sprined on the dot of this caccess caccess and when I became solid , he killed a dog .
He wasn 't the dog and created a brid , with the house house house house has created another dog , and it 's disappeared on the banker , and it 's disappeared on the banker ,
We want to talk about cavarsely with nothing ? [ Rison this , in different ways , [ Apausi is the symbol of the resilience of the world 's popular .
In the California , 1999 government 's the canadly control of a total area of territory area of a larger area of the California and Texas .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's an independent terrible . They are condent for the minerary resources .
One splay example of how a nation-state can remember with his popular .
And finally , I think it 's pretty obvious at least who of us was in these remote zones of the planet , remote that not are dealing that they 're not dealed .
For someone is house .
They represent human imagination that they represent the high high high high . And for us all , the dreams of these kids , as the dreams of the hope .
Finally , we have National Geographic we are convinced that politicians will never get to nothing .
We believe that polemiics --
[ Apausi ] no persuade ] but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the world , maybe we 're the best institution to tell the world stories . Every month 35 million visit .
156 countries transmitted our television canal .
Our reviews are millions of people .
Our work is travel to bring our audience in the place of wonderful cultural wonders from cultural revealed by how they 're going to get away they 're hoping , hubraced , they 'll be able to get our own time for the central revealing in the world , and we have to find a lif-life in a world and multicultural world .
where the wisdom of all the popular wisdom .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope called more more than you 've already heard and try to evidence some connections , in the case not them .
I want to start with what I call " the " official dogma . "
The official dogma : What ?
The official dogma of all industrial society , the dogma official dogma : " If we want to massive male the well-being of citizens . "
The reason is , from a hand in the fact that freedom is in itself a value , useful , useful , useful , essential for human beings .
And the other is in the other is that if we 're free , each of us can act for all of us to do everything that massive to do everything that massive our well-being , without any decided in the name .
The way to massive freedom is massive to choice the choice .
The more choices people have , the more than people are free , and more is their freedom , the major is their well-being .
This , I think , is so deeply radical in society that no one would have to doubt it .
And it 's also deeply radical in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I 'm going to give me a simple note about conditivent .
In my supermarket there are 175 conditions , without content the 10 oil of oil and 12 acetables of the balsamic and you can buy for you a huge number of constantly in the including circumstance that no 175 ready ready ready ready ready ready ready to your degree .
This is what supermarket .
Then you go to the electronics stereo to buy a stereo : CD , lector , radio , radio , the CD , radio , printed , printed , printed ,
And in this single electronic negotie , there 's a great number of car components .
We can do six million and a half of different combination using the components that there are in one only negoties in a only store .
You have to admit that there 's a lot choice choice .
Other the camps : the world of communications .
Once I was a child , they could get all the phone services that they could get all the phone services that were provide by mom Bell .
And they did the phone , he didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , between the other , was that the telephone was not break .
These days have gone .
Now we have a variety of telephones , especially between the phones .
Here 's the cellular mobile phones of the future .
My favorite is that in the midddle , MP3 , cut of the nose , and the bunch for the crytheless me .
If you haven 't seen it in the store in the negotie , you 're going to be able to be .
And what happens at the end is that people enters in the stops and he does this question . And you know , what is the answer ? The answer is No .
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the buy bugs , is the same explosion of choices .
Auseence health care : it doesn 't happen in the United States you go on the United States and the doctor , you know what to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do A , or B , " A , " A has these benefits and these risk " B has these benefits . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Dotter , what would I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risk benefits and these risk . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you can rebad , " Dotter if she was me , what would do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not she . "
The result of the result of the malate , expression that makes it seem to be a nice thing .
But it 's actually not a move the weight and the responsibility of taking someone that knows the doctor , to someone else that nothing -- and almost certainly not -- and almost certainly is sick -- and so not in the ideal condition to make the patient .
There 's a huge marketing of drug products , direct people like me and you , that if you think about it doesn 't have any sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do they do they do it ?
The answer is that they want to be that doctor for ask them to ask them to change the recipe .
Something that 's fundamental as our identity is a question of choice , how you see in this vision , " We don 't want to forced children . We don 't want to be able to give the children . " We don 't want to be a identity : we need to invent .
And we can reinvent us how many times we get there .
That means that every morning , at the morning , you have to decide that kind of person wants to be .
I 'm going to look at family and marriage , a common time , a common , a common , almost for anyone , was that he was that he was that he was that saying the most possible possible , and he was beginning to get the most possible .
The only real choice was choice with who , not when , and not when , and not even what to do after .
And then it 's really to play .
I teach very smart students , and I 'm 20 percent of work than a time .
And not because they 're saying less , not because they 're saying .
but why I 'm impensiered , I 'm asking , " I should I be married , or not ? I should I do that now ? "
" I should be marrier ? I have to think about before or the career ? "
They 're logoring interrogative .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implies not completing the tasks that assume that achieving and not get a beautiful vote to my examed .
And they have to do it . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl Sarl , because technology allows us to work in every single day , every single day , every single day , from the Hotel Randolph .
And I 'm talking about , there 's a corner , and I 'm not going to tell you where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible freedom freedom of choice we have about work ? That 's still not going to decide , and if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our child play with the cell phone in a pocknear , the Blackberry in the other , and the notetetextbooks .
And even though they 're all spent , every minute we see our baby robaby , we 're also asking , " I have to say , " Do I have to say , " Do you say ? "
" I have to say that email ? I had to habood this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , " all this makes the experience of your child very different than that was in other conditions .
So , from any part of the little bit of it , little things , and large materials and lifestyle , life is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : there were some possibility , but not all that was a question of choice .
The world today is this : The dilemma is : " Is it a good thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Should you be able to be .
The positive slightly , so I 'm going to talk about the negative ones .
All this choice company two effects two negative effects on people .
The first one , paradox is that produces instead of liberation .
With the options of which choose , becomes very hard to do it .
I offer a significant example : a conduct study that a volunteer pursue .
A colleague has access to the Vanololler data , the gigantic society of the funding of the fundamental clients , with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she found is that for every 10 solutions that are taking in more , the percentage of adesion , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 percent offered , there 's 10 percent in less than the adesions of them when they 're available . Why is it just five percent ?
Because with 50 funds of that choose , is sick to decide , and the choice is to decide , and the choice is remaining the indeed .
And at the questions , and I still ask questions , questions , and of course , and questions never get to .
You know that doesn 't mean that only is that these workers are going to be missing food for dogs because they don 't have enough money , it means that the decision is so ostics that it 's so hating the fundamental fundamental fundamental fundamental fundamental fundamental dator 's datory .
Not to participating , they 're losing to five dollars from the dator of the work , which would be well well as it was going to be so much .
So , the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world .
" And finally , for eternity : ketchup , senaps or maionese ? "
You 'd like to take the right decision , if it 's for the ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the bottom , and you don 't want to choose the wrong source .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoid the paralysis , and we 're fewer slide at at the end of how we would be with less options from the result of how we would choose .
And that 's for several reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions in which you pick up , and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine you you you could make a different choice . And what 's going on is the alternative imagine that would be better . And what 's going on is the alternative imagined us . And what 's going on is the pammicate is that the decision ,
And even when it was a good decision .
The more choices there are , the easier is easy to displeasure of any detail that 's insod-called choice .
And also , there 's what economist-opportunity is .
Dan Gilbert asked very well as a value as the value we take to the things that we take the depend on what we comparison .
In the rest , when there 's a lot of options , it 's easy to represent the characteristics of the scarticulate and be less slide in the option that is choice .
Here 's an example . I school with all those who are not New York .
But that 's what you probably think about it .
There 's this couple to the Hamptons .
A place of a lusse .
It 's all splendida . Ottim days . It 's all for them .
Not . But what he thinks is , " Well , maledition , it 's Augosphering . "
" All my neighbors at Manhattan is away . "
" I could talk about it right in front of home . "
And it 's two weeks , from the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The expensive opportunity is decreasures the satisfation for what we have , even when choice was excellent .
And the more are the options we have to consider , the more the characteristics are going to be returned against how expensive things are going to be .
Here 's another example .
This is a vision tells us a lot of things .
It 's about living the moment , and maybe living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you choose to do , you know , you choose to do the other .
The things that we don 't choose have a attractive attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : it 's a growing of the expectations .
I tried to my skin my skin , and I bought it 's a couple of jeans .
I 'm almost always jean .
Once the jeans were only one guy , buy them and bought them and bestive from bestion , they were dissimed , only after they brought them a lot of times , they began to go well .
So I went to buy a new when the old old those old baded , and I said , " I need a couple of jean , this is my wrong tune . "
The commit told me , " He wants to be slim , easy fit , relaxed fit ? "
I want to do them with the cernight , or with the bottons ? " Stonewashed , " or " ached ?
" Do you want to do it ? "
" Sott them wants to large , blades ? Be blaw -- " Continured to elense .
I was baladen , and after a while I was able to say , " I want the kind of like , " I want the kind of , " He didn 't have idea what it was , so for a time I tried to all jean jean , and then I came out from the couple of jean that I ever had .
It was the massive . I had the whole choice , I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand that .
The reason I was worse with all that choice is that with all of that choice , the jeans had to be perfect .
I started waiting for me . I wasn 't wait . I wasn 't wait for a kind of , but when it was 100 different , step , at least a kind of should be perfect .
What I had was buy , but I didn 't perfect .
After I had compared that choice with what I was trying to do with what I was trying to do with the expectations .
The addition of options in the lives of people don 't make the expectations that these have respond to the options of the options of the same .
And this will make less soddisfation , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing in the world of marketing .
Because if they knew it , you 're not talking about what I 'm talking about .
The truth is more about this .
" You 'd better when he was worse . " The reason you were better when he was worse , it was that when he was worse , when he was worse , it was that when he was worse was possible to meet the surprised .
And the world , in the world we live -- opulent , industrialized industrialized industrialized , the massive of perfeature -- the massive we can hope is that the things are at the height of the aspectative .
You never surprised because your expectations , my waitable , my aspectative , you 're ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse waiting " Yeah , " Yeah , you want . "
I mean -- small autobiographic moment -- which I 'm really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't have to do , I don 't have accounted .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of the buy of jeans , when there 's only that when you 're not satisfacts , and you ask you , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " You know , the answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What can I do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a pink insoddisfacing , and you ask you who is responsible , it 's as a clear that responsible , is as a clear that responsible for responsible , is as a close to you .
You should have do better .
With hundreds of available variety , there are not taking the unsuccess .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is wind , they 're wallow , and they give the colcolcols their own .
In the last few years , the depression of the depression of the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but the only one -- that 's important -- of this depression is just that people have the experiences because the standards are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that colcolcolor is them .
So the final result is that we 're better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remind you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than having it , but from this is not at a time .
There 's a critical value , magical value . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we have played by a piece of the level where the choices are improve our life .
Now , from political point of view -- I have almost finished -- from political point of view , the political point .
What 's allows all this choice in the industrial society is material .
There are many places in the world , and you know about it , where the problem isn 't they too much .
The problem is they have too a few too powerful .
So the face of the face I 'm talking about is a sick of modern , recents , the Western society .
And what he does to be an arrage and is this : Steve Levitt talked about how those expensive and coos for bats and cocococococobs are unuseful .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dispendious , it 's not just unuseful .
They 're admit for a lot of them .
They make it more worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows choice was reversed in those people where they too few people have too few possibility , not only would be the improve , but also our life .
This is what economists call a pareting improvement .
A refined refined refined , not only to the poor -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice , in the way back us back .
For conclude , " Film , you can become everything that you want , "
You , you 're about culture , people you 're thinking , " What does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get it into a glass of glass . "
" A imagination castrated , a vision of the world --
and I 'm interested in this , at the beginning .
But then , think about it , instead , I realized that that fish the long-gone .
Because the reality is that if you eat the reality bocks , so that all is possible , " You don 't get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you bumps the boat so that all divent possible to decrease the satisfation .
You get to get the paralysis , and you 'll reduced well-being .
They all need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the axion of some sphere is a recipe for infection and , for roine .
Thank you very much for heart .
