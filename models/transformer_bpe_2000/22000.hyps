The year I showed these slide demonstrate that the arct glacial calculate , which for almost three million years had the United States of the 48 States continental , it 's records of 40 percent .
But this subjectle this underlying gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the spector of the ice .
The articy calculate cleaning is , in a sense , the heart of the global system .
You expanding on the winter and you raise .
The next slide is going to be a fast-25 years .
The ice perends are red in red .
As you can see , they expand to the blue .
That 's the ice in invern , which is running .
You can see that the ice garm lost , of five years or more , is like the blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is square from the body .
In 25 years , it was spent by so ,
This is a problem because the scale of the interest in the ocean arctic , where there are enormous amount of coal congeled that , scientists , they 're transformed in meter from microbes .
I 'm going to be a totality of the atmosphert of global warming , that amount could double , superperatmospected this point of not around .
In some deep in Alaska little deep in Alaska , the metane is already rebuling from water .
The professoresse Katey Walter of Alaska of Alaska , was rected with a team pressed with a team pressed to the invern .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Lake 's good . The question is if we 're going to be .
A reason is that this termal exchange surrise from Greenland from the northern .
This is a river of glacial reme .
The brought never had to get similar .
This is the Kangerlussuaq in the south of Groenland .
If you want to know how it 's sal level to sea to be sweeping on land , here is where you get to sea .
These corrings are are rapidly increasing .
On the other side of the planet : Antarcttops of the planet .
The month , the scientists have directly direct that the gathering of ice is in negative , and the Antarctarctica , which is very fast in some ises , it 's particularly fasty in the slaptop .
Equid six meters of the acive , like Greenland .
On Himalayas , the largest block of ice , they see new laghi , which few years ago were driving .
The world population was half of the world 's population half water from the population .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the powerful water of this city .
The louted is increased .
But when you decrease , the same happens to be populable to water .
In California , the newspaper is diminuity of 40 percent .
The backkkkay is in crisis .
The predictions , like you read , I 'm graves .
The growth security growth in the world leads to a remarkable of incends .
The environmental disasters are increasing out of the normal and without precedental .
Four times more numeroes in the last 30 years respect to previous 75 .
This is a whole thing that 's a sustainable .
If you look at it in the stories , if they can see the consequences .
In the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons in the oceans every day .
Look attentially the area of the Easter , from the Americas , to the Americas , to the Americas , and both of the subjects , where there 's a poor of the indian continent in the world .
The major causes of global warming , together to the deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fuel .
The oil is a problem , and coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the most emissions with China .
And it was proposing a lot of other coal deal .
But we 're seeing a change of direction .
These are the annative projects in the last few years and some proposes of verhigh alternative .
And so , there 's a political thing in our country .
The coal industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year for promoting coal of the carbon , which is a bone .
And this image I was going to something --
I 'm going to go Natale , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion lions of carbon dial scories .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second largest flow of scories in America .
It happened around Natale .
The nature advertising of one of the carbon industries was this .
Video : Without to be , " Frosty the carbon and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it makes our economy .
Frosty the carbon is and more and more public .
It 's good price , adorable and workers keep the stay .
Al Gore : West Virginia is fast of the West Virginia .
The largest minerary society is Massey Coal . This is his mountains .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'm going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Proteition of Clima has launched two campaiged campaiged two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : ALergy : All COLergy see the climate change as a serious threat our business .
So , our priority is investing a great amount of money in a publicitary to make public and confused to make it public and confused to do it .
Actually , coal is not sport .
We 're not going to be clean -- it 's also a good profuse .
So not preocupateves of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Carbon : Carbon -- you 've heard a lot of it .
So , you get a turn in a structure on the one of the way it is about coal .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noious , but this is the sound of the technology of coal public .
The consumption of carbon is between the main warming , but the night technology , the night technology of coal , but the remarkable technology you see .
You have a look : this is the coal technology of coal .
Al Gore : In the hort positive connects to the economic issue and to the economic security and to that national security .
Video : Lowever : America is in the crisis ; the national security , the national crisis .
The file that colleague of all : our dependence by fuel fuel and the importance of oil and the imported oil .
But , there 's a new , car solution for use .
Repower America : 100 percent of clean energy in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work , make us more sure , and help us stop the warming warming .
Finally , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
Repower America . Scover more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's about regiving energy to America .
One of the speed ways to bring us to end end dependence on the dependence that killed our planet .
What 's the future is here . I 'm here , only one , a new energy .
What you know two : Noves for a bad job retributes .
Coming : Repower America . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old African opening African says , " If you want to go fast , you go from soles .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
The year at TED phect-dought in the LHC .
And I promise to traveling you about how the machine works .
So here I have no , the LHave the other time there was no , the LHC is the greatest scientific experiment ever -- 27 kilometers of circumference .
His task is to remember the conditions that were less than a billion in the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
And that 's just environment .
This is the Ginevra under Ginevra .
We 've been photographs Big Bang Big Bang in the remarkable .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- it 's 44 meters and a 22 meters .
This is an ATLAS imagine in building so you can see the proportions .
Time tember last year we have accesum , we accesum the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It 's because of immense festegation in control .
It 's a picture of the first phasy of particles that had all the LHC , both in collision , by a part of the LHC , and spread particles in the LHC , and spread particles in the remarker .
In other words , when we see that image 10 to the tember 10 to the tember , we realize the machine worked , which is a great vicicicicy-huge vician .
I don 't know if it was this to make us more or this , when someone went on Google and saw that the began was this .
That means we had a cultural impact beyond that scientific impact .
About a week after , there was a problem with the machine , had to these drugs here -- these dored drugs .
These files are 13,000 leaving when the machine works at the massive works .
Now , the technicians between you look at the physs and say , " It 's not true . I 'm too much subtle . "
And they can do it because when they 're very cold of becoming out of the superconditions .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a temperature to that of the space between the stars , these flows can bring that corrate .
In one of the most of the nvealle-magnetal namile magnetal defect in one of the fect of the fect of fect-bed junk .
So the files survivally , and the 13,000 leather of the 13,000 leap improvement .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnetes fish are more than 20 tons , and that you have been about 30 centimeters .
They 're damaged about 50 magnetes .
We had to take them , what we then did .
We repristed them and adverted them .
They 're coming back all of their place to their place underground .
I mean , the end of marze the LHC will be again .
We 'll accendered , and we waiting to get to right or lights , and continue our adventure to discover what the morning to find what the morning of the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents reaccend the debate of science and engineering the value of science and engineering . It 's easy to confanting .
I think that 's so difficult , the fact that 's so difficult to go beyond the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a English English , Humphrey Davy , the defense of the involved of his own pupile , the Michael Faraday , he said , " Nichael Faray , said , " Nient is so dangerous for the progress of human return to the ress of science is , which we don 't measures in our monures , which is not measures are in the sques that we don 't be completed . "
Thank you .
I want to start ask you to rethink about when you , children , you play with children , play with the morning .
And as you get to reach them , and you get them and to get them , and move them , learned to think , and learning to think of problems and sent them , and they 're going to think about space relationships .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand the world around us .
So , from information information , I started to be inspired by our physical interaction with my physics , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking me , " And if we use a computer , instead of having only a computer , instead of having only a computer , instead of the digital poller , which is on a desktop of the digital dest information with both manes ,
and we systemle to our placiment ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computing , a big computer interactive as a birth .
In a few words , a Siftable computing , a big computer interactive as a birth .
You can move them with your hand , they can see it , you can see the movement and they have a screen and a radio radio radio .
But basically , I 'm physics , like physics , you can move simply simply fy .
The Siftable of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physicists , conscious , conscious , of other , and as they become more physicists , conscious , of the other people of the movement , of the other people of interaction .
I 'm going to start with a simple example .
This Siftable is configurated to show if it in a direction , the video raised so , if you including it in a direction , if you including it back .
These interactive ritrats are conscious knowledge of other .
If I join them , they 're interested in what 's around .
If they 're circummmit , they can be an be a little bit .
If they 're circummmit , they can be an be a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power of using the data , for example , to put a color like a liquid , as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurated as a secks of vernice and I can use them to put them to the color in that mix .
and I can use them to put them to color in the mix , where they mix .
If we 're too much , we can put a little bit in place .
You also have beautiful possibility to learning , like languages , the mathematics and logical logical logical and logical logical logical things where people can try and see the results of it .
Now , I 'm going to --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a equations of equations .
Here we have a word of words that 's half of Scarabean and Boggle .
Pratically , at every turn to a letter in case on every Siftable , Pratically , at every turn a letter in case , and you get a letter on every Siften , and while you 're trying to buy deaf a dictionary .
Then , about 30 seconds of you remiss , and you have a new set of lectal and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here 's children came to Media Lab , I did this and I did tried them and turned a video .
They were very pleased .
And one of the interesting things about this application is that you don 't have to give people a lot of education .
You just say , " I mean , " Compones of the words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's how other people who try it .
This is our younger head , there on the right there .
And it really wanted to be implement .
They were only morning onces , for him .
Now , this is a charge of a cardboard application .
We wanted to build a tool for the apprints of languages is Felix .
It can insert new characters in the scene , only by by the Siften , they can be associated .
It can insert new characters in the scene , only by by the Siften , they can be associated .
Here , it 's doing sune .
Video : The sunder is .
David Merrill : Now he brought a track in the scene .
Video : The arange arange .
By work ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes !
So I school with Siftable and put them close to bring their characters --
Video : Bau !
and by inventing their story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him how you want to go .
DM : It 's a story with the open , and it can decide him how you want to go .
Video : Voly , gat the cat .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , realized of it , to be able to campaipionem and exececual music .
It 's a tool , realized , to fix and figure and execting music .
The Siftable here are growing from suund as based , based and bacteria .
Each one of these four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also put these sounds in a sequence to buy your plon-pacuent .
And it just fashion , just doing a sound and a sequence .
These are actually control that you can control from vive , as the reverbs and the filter .
I 'm going to a particular sound and then including it to the fashion .
And then there are the general effects as long as and fly , and you 're going to the sequence .
We look at how it works .
Video : DM : We 'll start putting a base in two Siften Siften " sequence , we put it in a series , we add other things .
Now I put a low line .
Video : Now I add some percussions --
DM : And I 'm going to put the phild the bacteria , so I can control the effect of vive .
DM : DM : DM : I can speak the whole sequence of time by one side or another .
Video : And I 'll add the filter to the low to the low to give more expression .
DM : DM : DM : I can recombine the sequence " to fly . "
So I don 't have to get it first , but I can improvement it , and it 's a longer or more corta .
And now , finally , I can fump the whole sequence inclinding to the left the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is build new interface men and more more more more than the machine than how our brain work and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this performance , and even some chance that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that 's coming up this new generation of designed objects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in our world way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writing written .
I 'm writing books is my profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also the love and the fashine of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , I said this , something particular happened in my life and my career , which took me to remember the whole life , and I brought the whole thing to remember with this work .
The particular thing is I recently written this book , this biography called Manogy , Prega , Ama , " which , diversity of my precedented books , for some reason that , I was going to be a big sensationship , buller , buller ,
And the result is that everywhere I 'm going to go , people treat me as if I was convicted .
It 's true -- condanned , condanned !
They 're going to me to all worried and say , " Don 't you get any more than to be able to do better ?
You 're not fear to continue to write for all life without power to be able to create a book that can important someone ? "
Which is important to someone ?
It 's rassure , you know .
But it could go worse , in the most of that I remember than 20 years ago , when I started to say , I was a adolescent -- I was a writing .
I went to meeting at the same reaction .
And people said , " Don 't get a successful join ?
Don 't you fear that the umiliation of killed you ?
Don you 're not going to be able to do this for all life without that nothing is ever out and die on a heart of a drawings with the mounlo of drawing with the mountain of fill to fit ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I fear of all those things .
I always waste .
And I also fear a lot of things that people could not have to be able to be .
As the algae and other things .
But , as I 'm going to write about what I thought , and I asked my final , is why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anybody to expect to be spected by a job that you 've been born to do .
But what 's there is so particular in the creative impress to make us nervous health of health health , in a way that other career do not ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemist and I don 't remember of one in the 40 years of activity where he was asked if she fear to be engineer ?
In 't it -- that block of the engineer John , how did it goes ?
Don 't work that , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals as group , as a group , they didn 't have certainly , in the chemicals , the reputation of being handed in the several .
We have enough , we have enough this reputation , and not only the writer , but creative to be a lot of being huge . We have this reputation of being huge instable to be huge instable to .
And it 's not more than looking at the sad of the magnificent death of the creative death , only in the 20th century , they died young and often for them .
And even those who are not suicides seem to be retough by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before I die , in the last interview said , " Every my book killed a little bit more . " A amazing a little bit of his life .
But we don 't bad bad skyl , when we feel that we 've heard these things that in some way we completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering the notion that creativity and art , in the end , it will during the anghscious .
And the question I want to bring to everybody here is : You 're agreed with this idea ?
You go well to this thing -- because even look at it 's a midd-distance to me , it doesn 't be good for anything this supposed .
I think it 's odiosa .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see it perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encourage our big creative minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- would be very dangerous to start to the heart that heard of the support , especially dangered the circumstances in my career .
I 'm young -- look at the time , I 'm young , I 'm young , I 've got about 40 years .
I still have about four decades degrees in me .
And it 's very likely that anything write about now is going to be judged by the world as the work that was going to be jumped by my last book .
I 'm going to be square , because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's likely my success is to my wild .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking about a person to start behind one person to start behind the nine in the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would be going to continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how do it ?
And so it seems , after many reflections , that the way to work to continue to write is to create a psychological costruck , right ?
I have to find a security of security between me , which I 'm write , and my natural anxiety on which reaction is going to get . And as I was trying to look at the time , looking for all the time , looking for all of the time , looking through time , looking at the time , looking for the best ideas to see if they could have better ideas .
about how to help people create creative to get people to get the risks of creative creativity .
And that search me on the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
I 'm going to go back to circle and then back to circle back .
In the antica Great and ancient -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity was giving from men , OK ?
It was thought that the creativity was this spirit , and that was going to be slightly and humans , someone distant distant and unknown , for reasons and unknown .
The greeeef called the creativity of creativity " demon the demon .
Socococtops , it was believed to have a demon that else goes from away .
The Romanivers were the same idea , but they call that kind of spirit .
And that 's great , because the Romanes didn 't really think that a genius was a very smart .
They have a genius was this kind of entities that had living in the walls of the study of a artist , a little bit like the elfter Doby , and that was out of a Dobby , and that was out of the artist and model the rest of the artist and modeling the result of that work .
Except -- here 's the distance of which I talk about -- that 's the psychological costruction that you protected from the results of your work .
And everybody knew that was so it worked , right ?
So , the antis were protected by certain things , like that , as you 're too narcisix-arcysm , right ?
If your work was excited about it , you couldn 't take it all , all of the touched , all of the people who were helped by this genius .
If your fabor work , it wasn 't all your , right ?
And they all knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people han concept for a lot of time .
And Renascivvance came and changed , and nacial , and we put the human being in the center of the universe on all the mists and more and more leaving space to the mists that write from the deming of the deming .
This was the rational of humanity and people began to think that creativity was completely about the shared .
And for the first time in history , I began to referred to this or that artist as a rather than one person in a rather than one person in the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think that will allow someone , simple person to create as a recipient as a source , the essence and the source of all the degrees of all the divins , inoscial and a responsibility of a too big file to the fragile humans .
It 's like to ask someone to ingoal .
Deform and forth and completely the ego and creates all of these things things about performance .
And I think it was this pressure to addrown artists in the past 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it 's , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and creative .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of rational thinking in a talk of 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people between the audience that sollevered to the scientific notion of , inso-, you do that they follow people follow out there or spring their projects .
I 'm not going to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to bring is -- why not ?
Why don 't you think that way ?
Because it 's more sense of anything that ever heard to explain the exasperts of the creative process of the creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever ever ever ense to do something -- so , basically , all of this , of course , you know , not realize rationally .
And , in fact , it can sometimes seemed to look totally paranormal .
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poetetesse , who has now 90 years , but it 's been a poeteth for all life and told me that during his childhood in the Virginia , working out in the Virginia , working out in the Virginia , working out in the field .
I was like a fragorous of air .
And that was rotate to be back to her from landscape .
It was to feel that , because it was going to be a tremendous feet .
He knew to have one thing to do at that point and it was about , words like a major . "
And so it goes to go to the home and he wouldn 't have to make anything else that I take a piece of paper and a fast enough of paper and a fast , while the trapassed and south .
Sometimes couldn 't be fast enough , so it goes and run and run it was not able to get into home and poetry her through and she wasn 't going to be rotated through and she would continue to rotolar through the landscape , trying to , how she said , " one other poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece , I never forget -- there was a moments where it was almost losed .
So , he was running to the card and was looking for the paper and was looking for the poetry , and he was going to a matter in the way , and then he said , " which was like to hold with the other hand and the offer .
And he was willing the poetry from the tail and reput it in his body and she was page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect page and intact , but the last word .
So when I thought , I 'm going to feel -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly equal to my creative process .
I 'm not a condition of this -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a music , and my way to work is ; I 'm a music , and I 'm going to go and go and go back and go on and go on and go out and go on and go out and go on .
But even I , in my head , I bought against that thing , sometimes .
And I think that 's also a lot of you have the han done .
You know , even if the work and ideas were given me from a certain source I could not honestly .
What is this thing ?
And how can we relationing to it , not to make us lost us , but rather , rather , rather , what do we make us save us ?
And as I look , the best example of the contemporary example I have is the Tom Waits , which I 've been interviewed in a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of the life was the incarnation of the artist , trying to contemporary species of creative inspiring these species of creative inhorized interized .
But then I 'm invited , he calculate , and one day as he was driving on a automoment , he changed everything for him .
He was going to go speaking and all of a sent this little sent of the elody , which comes in his head as it does inspiration , and it wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and it wants , you know , it 's wonderful , but not as it .
It has a paper , it doesn 't have a math , it doesn 't have a register .
So , it begins to feel this species of old , and he began to lose , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to lose it from this song .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , they stopped .
I 'm going to do the whole mental process , and it was something completely new .
I just look at the sky and said , " Scuses , you can 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" Do you know , you know , a song hour ?
If you really want to be there , back to a more opporting when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you 're going to important someone else today .
You go to disturba Cohen . "
And his process worked changed after this .
I don 't work , the work was still dark as well .
But the process , and the fish that was re-handed , when the genius , the genius that was caused to him to be , and the genius of the genius that problems and fashion where it was , to make it back to where it was , to do not be an interized and glased .
but it 's gone to this peculiar , wonderful bizar-collaboration between Tom and this strange thing that 's not Tom .
So as the story I felt to change a little bit even the way I worked in and already worked on me .
This idea , I was saved when I was writing " Manogy , Ama , " and I caddress in one of those caves that we 're working on something and we 're not going to start to think that 's going to be a disaster , which is going to be a disaster , which is going to be a disaster ever .
Not just just bad , just the worst written .
And I started thinking about gectate this project .
But then I remember about Tom I was talking about the air and I tried to the air and I tried to do it .
So , I got my face on the end of my hundred my common corner of the room .
And I said , " You know , what 's , " What , what we 're going to know if this this book is not going to be interactly colliages , not be interactly colliaging , not going to be interactly colliagges , right ?
Because as I 'm paying all I 'm paying all I don 't have any than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to make your part .
OK . But if you do not do it , you know what , I don 't do it .
I 'm going to be writing the same because it 's my work .
And I want to do it for me that it was recorded that I 've been presented to do my part of the North , OK -- in the wildances of North people were sought for damances to the city of the clear , dances and music that were going to go on for hours and hours to the hours .
And they always were magnific , because the ballers were professionals .
But every while , something happened , and something happened , and one of these artists would become transendent .
And I know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've seen that , at some point , a performance .
It was like the time stops , and the ballerin the walked through a kind of a land-up and not doing anything different from the usual , as 1,000 nights before , but everything was sitting .
And suddenly not appeared as a human human .
But it 's happening in the divinity and under the fire of the divinity .
And when this was going to be , at the time , people knew what was , they called him his name .
They knew their hands and began to cantar , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God , " God , " God . "
That 's God , you know .
Curious nuts -- when More invading the South , I was this abitude with their and pronounce of " Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , " " Ole , " the race , " On , " the race , " which you can still feel in the corrids or flamp .
In Spain , when a artist has done something impossible and magical , " Allah , the words , " Allah , " I was , " Buh , " I walk up , " I 'm going to realize , " I 'm going to go back to God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But the problem is the day , for the dance , and the ballerin the morning , when you wake up and discover that 's 11 of Martedyes and I won 't there .
It 's just a mortal with mortal ginoccurs , and maybe it will never be able to get to that already already to make that alteety .
And maybe no one cannot have the name of God still as it gets , and what 's going to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's difficult .
This is one of the most pain to do in a creative creative life .
But maybe it has to be so angoscious as you can 't believe , if you can 't believe , indeed , the most extraordinary aspects of your own being from yourself .
But you just believe that you have a very prested by a source of this source of your life that is part of your life that you have to get to someone else when you 're finished .
And , you know , if we think about this , it 's all changing .
And so I started thinking , and it 's certainly as I thought , as I thought I 'm going to do it for different months , I 'm going to do some rest , the dangerous , spectacy , we spent , I was going to follow my great successful .
And what I 've got to continue to tell me when I feel elected by this is , not having fear .
Don 't just get your work .
It 's a deal of presented to your part , any way , whatever can be .
If your work is balling , balling .
If the divine , absurged to you assumed up , I 'm going to go some kind of wonderful , for only a moment through your effort , then " Okay ! "
Otherwise , do the same dance .
And " Ole ! "
I think it 's a lot of teach it .
" Ole ! " As you , even only for having love and test love and tops tal to get you continue to present you continue .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
You know , as you know , a few of these projects on the human genome , what it can meaning and new genes of new set of genes .
Now we 're starting a new thing : we started digitalize biology and now to start to start to start to the biology and now we 're enting a new phase of biology , design and design and synthetizing life .
We 've always been trying to bring big questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists I think they have lost to understand livels .
We tried different approaches , reduced to the minimal terms .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analogical world of the digital world of the computer digital world .
Now we ask us : We can regenerate life , or new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genitalium between those who can autoreum in the laboratory .
And we tried to reduce ulteriorable to create one more smaller .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 that I 'm here .
But when we look at his metabolic maps , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very unliving that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to provide that the only for provide this cromosome in way to modify the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the " Can we synthesize a cromosoma ? "
It can be the chemistry to produce these big molecules that never could make these big molecules that we never get to create before ?
And in case , we can make a cromosoma , can we work a cromosome ?
A chromosoma is just a piece of chemist of chemist .
The speed with that we 're able to digitalize life is growing to exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , it 's fairly , but it 's improvement .
And our more recent results that bring it on an exponential curve .
We 've been began over 15 years ago .
The process has required a lot of pass , beginning with a bioetic review before we began to begin .
But we found that DNA synthesize that 's very difficult .
There are thousands of machines of the world that producing small segments of DNA , of the 30-year-old and is a degenerative process : the longer segment is longer , the more errors .
So we had to develop a new way to make these fragments and run these fragments and correct the errors .
And this was our first attempt , to start to start to start by digital information of the genome of Phi 174 .
It 's a small virus that kills kills .
We designed the fragments , effected the correction of errors and get a molecule of DNA about about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemistry of chemistry , and we put it in bacteria , bacteria have began to read this genetic code and deal with viral particles .
The viral particles have been releft by the cells , they 're back and destroyed it .
I 've talked about the oil industry , and I 've been talking about that they have certainly compressed that they have certainly compressed this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in larger .
We wanted to build the whole cromosom of the bacteria .
I 'm more than 580 mies of genetic code .
So we thought we build it in seven of the virus of the virus , so that we can change the seven casses to understand what the seven of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 accuratity was a mistake for every 10 miles .
We 've discovered , 30 errors . 30 mistakes it original sequence . If we used that original sequence we never would be able to do it .
One part of the process is design segments that are subsigments that are subsigments to have all other segments of 50 letters to build smaller underundergrounity in the tiny , working together .
We try to get the only one here .
You probably have read a lot of the figls that we put it on the figls .
Think about four lect-based code code on four lectal code .
Three of those lectual together codify about 20 minoes , and there 's a specific order to be a specific order to every amount of lectal .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , framework , framework , framework .
What we did in the beginning was autograph to do .
Some of them were to be used to be in the fact that it wasn 't .
We designed these segments to just une them with it .
There are a crazy that are reputting them and put them together .
And we started assembly assembly , beginning with segments from five to seven miles , until the way to segments of 24 mile lectal lecular to get to 72 mies .
We 've made these sequences in abundance , so we made these sitting down to sequening them we 're trying to create a very very robustood -- as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems the tabelling of a basket playoff .
When we get these very long segments , more than 100 miles , they 're more than 100 miilable , they 're not going to grow more directly in the EEcoli .
It 's coming to the limit of modern tools of the molecular biology .
So we looked at other mechanisms .
We knew , we had another mechanism called recombination homologue , which in biology to repair the DNA able to repair the DNA to une the segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus , it can absorbed three million rad of radiation .
You can see in the suggest requarters as his chromosoma .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembly as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely seought .
They can live under a vacuum .
They 're absolutely certainly that life exists in space , and you could find new environments of water .
And in fact , NASA showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built with these processes , just using the light-evidence with the segments of segments .
The least assemble them automatically .
This image was not been taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a regularly regularly .
It 's a lot of this big molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that cover a six seconds .
This is the publication we did a little time ago .
It 's more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule than a defined structure ever created by man .
It 's a 300 million sudden in 300 million .
If we stay with a 10 without spact 10 without spaces , it would like 142 pages to transform this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ?
Of course , you love a virus is a game from kids .
It 's a little more complicated when they use bacteria use .
It 's easier even when it 's ekaries as ekariote as our : you can just get the nucleus and another , which is basically the clonation of clonation .
In the archaea , the battery is instead of integrated inside to the cell , but we have recently demonstrated that we are able to make a transplant transplant of a cell and activity .
We had a cromosoma parting from a microbial species .
The two are different as men from the tops .
We 've add a few gene in more than so you could decide what choose for this chromosoma .
The hundred with the encies to kill all proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was stupendownsticatood -- the new cromosoma -- the new cromosoma has been going to the cells .
And we started thinking we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to spend more in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms .
We 've found that a lot of species have add a second or a third romosoma by somewhere , add in a second thousands of tracks to that species .
So who think about evolution as only as a gene to the modies that doesn 't understand biology .
And there 's a kind of restription that advance of the restrition that they can digm the DNA .
The cromosoma that was in the cells doesn 't have one .
The cell cell cell that we have inserit-free that we have inserit-h-h-h-h--free .
And it 's expressed , and it recognized the other chromosoma as a material , has masticated , and we were only rhythized with only the celludge and the new cromosome .
it blue because of the genes we put .
And in a short time , all the characteristics of a species , they went to perx , and it turned of all of a new species , based on the new species , based on the new software we inserious in the cells .
All the proteins are changed , the member of these are changed , and when we read the genetic code of what we 've been transfer to what we 've transfer .
Now , this may seem alchemixics , but it 's software DNA , we can change things in a sustained enough sustained .
Now , I 've already explain 't talking about genesis -- but for progress to start from three million years and a half evolution , and I said we 're going to create a new version of the explosion of Cambrian in which will be real new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's quite obvious when we think about our needs .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half of a nine billion in the next 40 years .
Right for example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each other , in 1946 ; there 's four years , there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , clean and clean , medicinal and game for six billion and a half a six billion people .
It will be more draw to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion coal , more than 30 billion baries of coal baries .
That means millions of baries a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or whatever kind of process to reduce them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to have all the time of CO2 from these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
At day , thank you to scientific discovery of scientific discovery of genes , and I like to think that are the design design components , and I like to think that are the design future .
The electronic industry only only only has a dozen about components , and you think about how many different things are come out .
Our limits here is major biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , thank you very quickly , because of these synthesization , able to create what we call a combinatory combinatory .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million cromosomes a million cromosomes a day .
Think about these 20 million different genes or different different genes or to try to get the processes to produce either , new vaccines , we can change , we can change , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology , and create more biology that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for a chance to survive , chemistry or fuel , production of the chemistry , production of the etc .
This is an instantaneous instantaneous program that we 're working for for being able to seat and design species to be able to seat the computer .
Well , we don 't necessarily know , how they 're going to be .
We know exactly what they 're genetic code .
Now we 're going to focuing on the fuel of quarters .
You 've also seen that it 's a bad , you 've been a bad experiment .
We have a second generation of depends and third generation that will use enough to be on the fuel than than than either than the high value as either as either different kinds of butan-to-fun .
But the only way biology can have a great impact without increase without increase without more impact the cost of food and limitar the cost of food and limited the CO2 in matter before , we 're working on to design cells that can get to add cells that can get to reach this discover , and we 're going to have the first coal of those generation in about 18 months .
The sunlight sunlight sunlight -- but in our discoveries all over the world , we found different metods around the world , we found different metods of the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the ocean , about 2500 feet of deep water to the temperature of the water .
They 're using a molecular hydrogen molecular hydrogen energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can incanalone , which can easily be transported by the tubes , converting that CO2 in fuel , to drive this process .
So , we think we might be able to increase what we could increase what the basic question of what the basic is life . " And we have the basic engaging the whole industry .
Yeah . If you don 't do it from TED , where can you ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And also , we 're working for using the same metods to create vaccines .
You saw this year with influence , we 're always forth of a year and a dollar in less when it 's tracking .
I think that you can change building combines combines combines .
Here 's how the future could begin to look at change , now , the tree of evolution , acceling the evolution with synthetic bacteria , archaeucariarious .
We 're so so on the best people .
Our purpose is to be able to live enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'm going to show you , the most rapidly possible , some fundamental work , which we took to Microsoft in followed a year ago ago . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment that you can interact is to local level that remote a huge amount of data .
We 're seeing a lot of digital gabyte photos with a kind of zoom and continuous , for a panoramic speed , deaf the images like we want to want to .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , as big these gargument of data or the images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this is a scanning provent from Biiblic Congress , and reentered in the 300 megapian .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen on your screen in any time . It 's a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , example of not images .
This is Dickens Dickens . Every colon-colonna represents a chapter .
And to show you that it 's just about the textbook , we can 't do something like this , to make a real thing that 's about a real representation of the textbook , not a photo to show you that 's a real photo , not a photo .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little electronic book .
I don 't know .
This is an example more realistic . It 's a number of the Wordian .
Every images , the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and beautiful experience of a chart , or a quotic version or a quotidian , which is for nature a molteeth .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We created a fashion advertising -- much more than that you use in a normal advertising -- much more than that you use in a normal .
If you want to see the careful characterists of this self-, you can see it here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on screen .
We hope that this means to put it , and we 're going to be able to put the pop-up and other pop-up symps , and it doesn 't need to be necessary .
Of course , the maping is one of the oldest applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don 't want to lose time , if not to say that we have contributes to this camp .
These are all the streets in the U.S.
So , we go to something else .
This is actually actually the vive vive on the web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research at Noah Snavements , a student of Washington , with Steve Steve Steve Szeliski , with Steve Szeliski of Microsoft Rick Szeliskels of Microsoft Rick Szeliski .
And it 's from Seadragon the web , gestion .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one image to another and have this kind of experience to the other and have this kind of experience .
But the space collocation of the pictures here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization computers have registed these images together , so that correspond to the place in the recorrespond to the Deady -- all screen to the Grasm on the Montagne Roccious canader -- they 're taken . So you see elements of a slide show or imaging panish , or imaging panish , or imaging panic , and these things are all space space .
I don 't know if I 've been a few more environment .
There are a lot more space space .
I want to go to one of the original data of Noahhhimself -- and this is from a precedent prototype of Photosynth that we did work for the first time the extremely scortext-scortexten . And it 's not necessarily extent . And it 's not necessarily extended by looking at the environments we put in the environments we 've put in the website .
We had to worry about laws and forward .
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame of the Notre Dame . Baast Flickr . Baast , and you get images of the field of the other campus and you get images of the other campus and saying . On one of these arcions represent a picture that 's image that 's a picture of this model .
So , they 're all pictures from Flickr and they 're all colleaged to this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this way simple .
You know , I would never have thought about it wasn 't going to be working on Microsoft .
It 's very gratificant to get this kind of accoaching here .
I think you can see that 's a lot of different types of different different phones of phones to : from those SLR , a number of the phones to the phones in this environment .
And if I 'm going to try to look for those strange .
Many of you have been touched by faces , etc .
And somewhere here 's a series of photographs -- here 's a series of photographs .
This is a Notre poster Dame recorrectly correctly .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do the environment . This is now taking data from the ential memory of how to look at the earth , from vision of vision -- and connecting all of those data together .
All those pictures become colleaged , more than the som of parts .
You have a model of the land that emerging .
Think about this as a such of Stephen Lawler on Earth 's work .
It 's something that growing up in complexity as you use , and the antages that are using the use of the use .
They have pictures with a handed metimes with other people .
If someone is the idea of the idea of those saying saying the name , my photo of the chthedral photograph of Notre Dame improviviously , and I can use it to use of all of those data , and I can use it to be in that space , using the metaphor , using the social experience of everyone , using the social experience of cle-mobile cle-like social cross-like social cle-mobile of cle-like social cross-mode .
Of course , a consequence of this is virtual models of every interesting , in the land , collecting of every interesting , collecting not only from airs light-axion and symboyles and symultary , but from college college .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software is going to be able to do is that a certain point in the next few years , in the next few years , all the shared world 's going to be basically colleaged together ?
BAA : Yes . What 's doing is basically discover .
It 's creating hyperlinks , if you want , you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the basis on the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the security of semantic information that a lot of these images can get a lot of these images .
As when you get a research of images on the web , you digit on the web , and the textbook on the web has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what happens if that pictures you connects to all your picture ?
So , the amount of interconnection and the amount of rich and the amount of rich that is really huge . It 's a very huge effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible . It 's really incredible .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the major paces when you traveling and one of the ethnographics is the power of living between who has no forget the anti-traditions , between the wind , the wind of the past , the touched in the wind plant , you 're going to draw plants .
Basti think about the Jaguar travel even beyond the Via , or that the Milky , or that the mites of the Inuit are still meaningful , or that in Himalayas , in Himalayas , to remember the importance of the Dharma , to remember the important of the world , and the idea that the world that we live in asn 't assummmer ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stroped , well or a lot of generations ago .
And of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
We all hire . We all try to do .
We 're subjects to be retremely .
We have to death the inexorability of death , so we don 't surprising and ballies .
We all have art .
What holds is the particular of the song of the song of every culture .
Not matter that they 're the Penan ants of the Borneum or the following of the Haiti , or the following of the Haiti , or the guerries of the Kisut in Kenya , or a Curert in Kenya , or a Curerries in the heart of Sahara .
And I was my journey of journey in the desert of the yak in the desert of the Qoangma , in the Everest , the dead of the world .
All of these people teaching us that there are other ways of exists of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of music in the world .
And if you reflect a second , it 's a concept that can give you .
And together , the world 's cultures of the world create a spiritual life of the world , and cultural life that we fly want the planet and is important for the well-being like biological ragela of biological life as biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural ragela of the ethnosphere and can defining the ethnosphere , the total of all the concepts , dreams , mites , ideas , inspiration , inspiration , ideas , inspiration , inspiration , inspiration of the consciousness of consciousness .
The etnosphere is the patrimony of humanity .
It 's the symbmbmbols of what we are and what we can be as a species .
And because the biosphere was free consumed by the ethnotised and purthnossphere and much much more quickly .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species was or is on the orege of the same extinction because it 's false -- in the most optimistry -- in the most optimic enhypocalypocalm -- and you don 't even close to the power of the most optimistic -- that of the diverity of cultural diversity .
The indedex of this is , of course , the language .
When you 're born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a vocabulary rules .
A language is the sprazy of human spirit .
It 's the middle of which the animal of every culture is going to be in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a backin , a thought , a chance of spiritual chance .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we 're sitting here in Monterey , at least half is not more supply in the old children .
They don 't get more teached to children , which means , less you wouldn 't be , something that they 're already death .
What 's there more sad than the silence of being the silence , of being the last to talk to a language , not have a language of wisdom or to ancient the wisdom of the children ?
This orring was the state of somewhere in the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , a moor , a high , and a down-tomber language .
And I know someone of you say , " Isn 't it like that ?
The world would be a better place if we talk about all the same language ? " Bensim , then we talk all yorba .
I talk knew .
You 'll cover a tract thing that means not to talk about it .
Now I would like to do a journey through the ethnosphere --
a little journey in the ethnosphere to give you a assage of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of existing things that when I say , " It 's very different ways of existing .
We take for example this Barasana , in Amazon Amazon , Amazon , the settle of the anacond , which creds to the midddle of the west of the sacres of the sacres in the sacres of the sacres of the sacres of the sacres of the sacres of the sacres of the sacres of the sacres of the sacres of the sacres of the sacres in the sacres of the sacres of the sacres of the sacres of the waste in the wall of the west in the s
It 's a popular that 's not able to distinguish the blue because it 's the blue is identified in the time of the forest , which depends the popular depends .
They have a strange language and a regle language , " " exogament " : you have to be a different person who talk a different language .
And this is radical in the past mitological , but the particularity is that in these families that are talking about six or seven languages , because of matrimons of men , no one language .
They 're limited to listen and then start to talk about .
We take one of the most interesting tribe in which I lived , the Waorani Waorani , the Worani of Ecuador , a popular that has been the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 missionaries have taken a commit to a factor of a factor .
They did not seen that photographs that they had had never been returned in a few who was adichevolves , forget that this populating populating that this populating population never seen .
They collected the photos , they turned to the search of a form or a figure and , not find nothing , they have been willing to the distrate , and they killed the five missionaries with the lance .
But the Waorani didn 't only killed the strange .
They killed with them .
The 54 percent of mortality was caused by their same .
We 've been switing to generations and found two of natural death and when we stroy to know , they have a lot of them , they 've been invited to know , and then they were killed with the same .
The cactors were able to recognize the animal urina and recognize the species .
I was assigned a very interesting task , I was assigned a very interesting task when my professor of Harvard asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to intruspaces in the secrets of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and impossesser of the speed to make the zombic zombie .
To give a sense of miracy , I would have to understand the Vodoun and Vodoun 't .
It 's pretty complex about the metaphysical vision of the world .
Verice interesting .
If I ask you to tell me about the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianesimum , Islam , Budddismo , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that Africa is not have been able to be about religious . And instead of religious . And instead of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these very deep religious concepts in the tragic waaahs .
What makes the voodoor is the intense is the report of life and death .
So , you 're going to hire the spirits .
The spirits can be invited by Great Acqua , they respond to the dance of the dance and they replace temporary to the soul of vive the way to be the following it to be the following followed the following goes .
So , the voodoods are say , " You can go to a talk about God .
We say , we go to the temple and forget God . "
And from the moment that you 're going to draw you , is the spirit that you are , how can you do the eval ?
So you 're going to these incredible events : follow voodoor in the state of trance that touching unes of the power of the mind of the power of the body when it 's catalyzed in a state of the body when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme .
And the popular popular with the most extraordinary are the Kogi Nevada de Sierra Nevada de Sierra Marta Deada , in Colombia .
To sendent , the ancivilization that once living on the planets of Colombic in the farming of the Colombic in the popular , the population was on the massive , which is raic on the planture .
In a macy continent blood , this popular was never conquired by the spagged by the spagged .
And so today , they 're governed by a cler-herged , but they 're very extraordinary .
The young followed by the family to the family to three or four years , and they live secregated in a world made of good soubling and homes in a world of floor to the ice of the ice of the ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years to reduce the nine months of gestation that spring in the labor of the mother , are metaphor , are metaphor in the lack of Great Mther .
So , so , they get acculturated to the values of their society , values that they 're predict and only their predict and only their predict , they keep the cost of the cost of their ecological , or to say ,
At term of this incredible beginning , they 're improvement , and for the first time in life , the age of 18 years , they see a high-year-old , see a high-bad . And in that accounter-cutter , when the soles the beautiful valley , when the sole is confermed in the beautiful , everything that learned in theory , it 's a passe . The preme does a past ago , and it says ,
" Visle ? I 'm told you .
It 's stupend . Now it 's a lot of you protect it .
They call masters and larger telling us we , brothers of the world .
This is intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the indeed and environment we think about the environment and the old story of the noble self-vage , which is a razy razy , which is a razy razy in his simplicity or maybe we 're closer to the Earth .
The Ingenes are not easy or not feel undebults from the nostalogy .
There 's no space for these things in the Astopping , or the winds of the Tibet , but because of the time and ritual realized a mistic of the Earth 's not on the concept of the Earth 's not on the concept of knowledge neighbors , but the concept that the Earth can only live only because it 's infection is that it 's infected by human-consciousness .
What does it mean ?
And you want to say a kid of Ande that grow up , which is a spirit of Apu who will drit his destiny to be a destiny different , and it will have a deep different relationship with the mountain or that place , and it 's going to be a different rockety of a male that place has grown up with a male of male that a men mountain .
That 's the dimate of a spirit or a mineral craft is irrifying .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the meetaphor , and natural world .
I grew up in the forest of Columbia Britannicity creding that the forest to be .
And that 's made me a different human being from my Kwakiutl that believe that the forest the forests are the Hukukuk and the drives of the paradian and the downers that live in the northern of the world , spirits that they live in the northern of the world , explain that they 're going to during the beginning to the Hukwake .
If you start to look at these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some their sensitive discoveries . We take this plants .
I 've been taken this picture in the nordoctor in the nordoctor .
Mayahuasks about the ayahuasks , the most powerful summmed of the sciamanic repertorian 's repertorian .
What makes a fascinating the ayahuasks is not the potential of physics , but his elements . It 's composed to two elements .
From a landlady , this leaving a series of quickly , harmine and harmine , slightly hallucinogens .
I can take the only plant is a blue that it 's a little bit of consciousness , but it 's miscale , but it 's misceled with the leaves of a coffee of the Psychotridis .
This plant contains , very similar powerful , very similar to the seroxyltryptamine-five , methoxypamines .
If you ever see Yanomami , you 're going to get up for the nail that make a different set of species , anched methoxyptamine .
And so , to be that poller on for the nse is a little bit like to be spared by a fire paper of degree and landing on a mate of electricity . It doesn 't create a deming of the reality .
I had a often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who had the man psychedelic was psychedelic in the ' 30 in Mexico .
I 'm not going to be a classificate these triptamines like because if you 're not tell any of being done , because if you 're not told anybody to be told .
It 's possible to be absumerely if you were absolutely assummmen that money is in MAO .
Now , it 's beautiful : the quooline that are in this liana are injumps injumps , of the same kind of potential to be able to be the triptamines : in a 80,000 species of plants , how these are they 're not , but that if you combine two death death , but if you combine , it 's summmer , which is summmer to the sometimes ?
We use the great euffy of the proof and error , which can reveal .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " The plants are talking about it . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , the 17 variety of ayahuasks , which distinguy in the forest , and our eyes will return in the same species .
If we asked him how they 're going to be saying , " I thought I was going to know about plants , " I thought of plants , you don 't know everything ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take 17 variety in a night of lun-draw and each other , it will be a different .
And that doesn 't have a fashion to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that content sts to .
Now , there 's the problem is that even even those of us who have heart heart populs , but somehow to hit , but somehow reduced to our world , but somehow reduced to our real world , and it 's going to be more .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it will not remember for his driving or his innovations , but rather like the era that we were stopped and we used across and abbracing activally or accepted destruction of diversity and cultural diversity of biological diversity and cultural world .
All cultures through the several have been involved in a dance for new chance of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux didn 't stop being Sioux when they put out of the arc and fell and fill so as Americans don 't stop being American have been in horse and horse .
It 's not the change or technology that minaces the integrity of the ethnosphere . It 's the power .
The flight of the domination .
And if you look at the world , you 'll find that these are not cultures that these are not cultures .
They 're creating living and dynamics out of identify identify , which they 're beyond their ability of adaptation .
And that 's disboscrawings in the patria of the Penan --
a popular no-asian popular , in the sud-asian popular popular in the forest to a generation , and now reduced to the service and prostitution on the reserve of the redined , where you can see the river of the rivers , where you can see the river of the MCIIMCity , where the naves the Merian Cinese Midional City , where the naves the naves the horizone-middddddle Borneo , where ,
To take the stage to the wood dreams to the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are come with the discovery of the golder .
If we move on the Tibet montagges , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the during the political domination .
As you know , you know , the physics , the physics of a popular , it 's conviction of the universal , but the destruction of the lifetime , not only is that it 's not only condanced , but it 's not only not only is condanced , because it makes part of the development , because it 's part of the development of the development .
And you can 't understand the suffering of the Tibet until you get the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in the Western Cina through the Tibet , and by Lhasa with a young colleague , but only came to Lhasa to figure out what we 're going to feel about .
6,000 sacres sacres reduced in the polls and fill .
1.2 million people killed by military during the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical at Panchen Lama .
which means it was killed to the temple of Chinese invasion .
I was slide with Santity , during the diaspora that has taken the popular in Nepal .
His mother was impresoned and her colputed .
It was brought to a cost of two years old hidden in the age of two years , I would wouldn 't live without him .
The sister , which has done the same , was a lot of reeducation .
One day has been calculp-drafashion Mao and , for this transgression , was put to the works for seven years .
The pain of the Tibet can be inextremely , but it reinside of the popular is from the popular .
At the end , all of it reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the world monocromatical world or we want to take the policicromatic world ?
The great anthropologa Margaret Mead , before I die was that , in our next to die , in our go to this vision of the world , we 're not only going to see the whole gamma game of humanrise to a limited of human imagination , but one day we 'll be a sone-to-fashion .
And it 's umiliating our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Neolitical Revolution , who gave us the agriculture , which has made us to be able to fight in the cult of the seed , they summer the poetry of the cler , creating the gerarchy of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has 300 years .
That challenges that we have the answers that we have the answers to all the challenges that we 're going to get a millenny to come .
When you get these cultures of the world is asked what it means to be human , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all risky the possibility of being what we are : a conscious species , which has to make all the people and all the people and all the gardes can figure . And there are great moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the northern of the isola Baffin , when I went to hunt of the Baffin , and this man , Olaya , I told her the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The government canadese was not always gentile to be able with the Inuit and in the 1950s to stage our , we have rink them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refected to go .
The family , I tementioned for his life , and all his attacks , and all his attacks .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't temust cold , exploit .
The slites in origin was made of fishing pathers .
The grandfather than this man didn 't intimise from the arctic or or the library that suffize .
It 's gaaioled out , it 's calculate the skin in skin and defected in your hand defected in their hand . When you were congelated , they worked to create a bunch .
It 's spraised on the points of this caccept and when I solide , he killed a dog .
He washed the dog and created a brid , with the cass of the slethy , he had a slethly , he imbought another dog , and it 's disappeared on the banker ,
We want to talk about cavarsely with nothing ? [ Rate ] . And this , in different ways , [ Applausi is symbbol of the Inuit and all the people of the world 's resilience of the world .
In the open 1999 , the government canaded to Inuit the total control of a larger area of the larger California and Texas a together .
It 's their new patria new patric .
It 's a territory of independent . They all the minerary record .
One splends of how a nation-state can remember with his popular .
And finally , I think it 's rather obvious at least who of us was in these remote zones of the planet , remote that they 're not remote remote .
For someone is home .
They represent sections of human imagination that they 're doing at the high of the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , as the dreams of our children , become part of our children , become part of the geography of hope .
For finish , we have National Geographic . We are convinced that politicians never get to none .
We believe that polemies --
[ Applauses ] don 't have persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell stories of the world . Each our men 35 million lives .
156 countries transmit our television .
Our reviols are lessons of people .
Our work is travel in the etnosphere to bring our audience in a wonders of cultural world , from which they 're going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to abbraces in the central revelation : the world 's world 's world to exists . And we have to find a lifetime in a world plurala world of life in a world pluralister and multicultural .
where the wisdom of all the popular can contribute to our well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about you about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you 've heard more that you 've heard and try to get some colleages , in case not .
I want to start with what I call " " " " " " official dogma . "
The official dogma of what ?
The official dogma of all industrial society Western dogma dogma : " If we want to massive to do the well-being of our citizens . "
The reason is , from a hyourself , in the fact that freedom is precious , it 's precious , useful , it 's precious , useful , it 's precious , useful ,
The other is in the fact that if we 're free , each of us can be act for all that we can do everything that maxximes our well-being , without any one that decide in our well-us .
The way to massive freedom is massive to be massive choice .
More choice people , more choices are free , and more than it is their well-being .
This , I think , it 's so deeply radical in society that no one would be dreams of put it in doubt .
And it 's also deeply radical in our lives .
I 'm going to show you a few examples of what progress has been possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly great .
I 'm a simple nice nice on conditions .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without content the 10 variety of olive olive and 12 aceets that you can buy to do a huge numbers of conditions that no one of the 175 of your degree .
Here 's what 's about supermarket .
You can go to the electronic negotie : Can , lector , lector , radio , plag , radio , plag , plag ,
And in this single negoties , there 's a great number of electronic components .
We can make six million and a half different combination of different combinations that there are only in one negoties in one .
You need to admit that there 's a lot choice choice .
Other track camps : the world of the communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the desire services , you could get all the desire , to pat the moment , and they were forned by the mom Bell .
And he was giving the phone , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , between the phone was that the phone has never breaks .
These days are gone .
We have a lot of the limited telephones , especially between the cellphones .
Here 's the cellphones of the future .
My favorite is in middle , the MP3 , topels of the nass , and forth to the crule .
If you don 't even saw it in the store in the store , you 're going to get some of it .
And what happens is that people enter in the stages and does this question . And you know , you know , what is the answer ? Is it " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the acquific patterns , you get the same choices .
Auxiety : it doesn 't happen in the United States that you 're going to be going to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do A , or B , " A has these benefits and these slaughs , " By has these benefits . What do you want to do ? "
You have you say , " Dottore , what would I do I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , and these benefits , and these benefits . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebad , " Dottore if she was me , what would do ? "
And the doctor , " But I 'm not her . "
The result of the mate of the malate , expression that makes it seemed to look like a beautiful thing .
But actually , it 's not a fishing and responsibility of taking someone who knows the doctor , someone else 's doctor , someone else , and someone else 's not -- and almost certainly , and so it 's not in the ideal condition to take the patient decisions .
There 's a huge marketing of drug products , direct people like me and you , if you think about it doesn 't have any sense , given sense that we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do they public them ?
The answer is that they want to doctor to ask them to make them to change us .
Which is so fundamental as we is our horrise is a question of choice , as you see in this jumps , as you see in this jumps . They 're not going to be a identity . " We don 't get a identity : we need to invent .
And we can reinventing how many times we get us .
That means that every morning , at the answer , you have to decide that kind of person wants to be .
I 'm going to be spectackage , a time time , a common perspective , almost for anyone , was that was that you can , and began to get the most rest possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not even what to do after .
It 's really about it .
I teach students very smart students , and I do about 20 percent of work respect .
And not because they 're not bright , not because they 're wouldn 't because they 're not dealing .
but why I 'm impensierites , I 'm going to ask , " Would I wish or not ? "
" Would I be toulder ? I have to think before you ? "
I 'm interrogative interrogative .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this implessing , even if this is not completing the tasks and not get a good vote to my own examples in my own own extremendous .
And they have to do it . They are important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , as Carl underlucky , because it allows us to work every minute , every day , from every corner of the planet , transplay of the Hotel Randolph .
And it was talking , there 's a angle , and I 'm not going to tell anybody where , the WiFi works .
I don 't say , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible freedom of choice we have about work ? Is we have to work on the work ? Is we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son son playing calculate , with the Blackberry in a tank , the Blackberry in the other , and the narkberry .
And even though they 're all spending , every minute that we see our child , we 're also asking , " Do you say , " Do you say , " Do you say , " Would you say to this call ? "
" I have to say to this email ? I had this letter ? "
And also when the answer is no , " " that makes the experience of your child very different than than what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the things , small things , and large material , things and lives of life , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Ovice , there was some possibility , but not all that 's a question of choice .
The world of today is this : The dilemma is , " Is a positive or negative ? "
The answer is , you know , it 's Should you be .
The slide slide we all , so I 'm going to talk about those of the negative ones .
And this choice company two effects two negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxally , it 's a paralysis that produces instead of liberation .
With a tant options of the choose , becomes very difficult to do it .
I offer a meaning example : a conducted study plans of volunteer pensioning .
A colleague had access to the data of Vanch , the giant society of thinking , with about a million clients of funding , with about a million clients entered in 2,000 different companies .
What she 's discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the lower of adesion of two percent .
With 50 source source , there 's 10 percent in less than adeside when they 're available to only five . Why ?
Because with 50 sours of the scale , it 's sick , it 's sick to decide , and choice is remained to the questions .
And I 'm going to ask questions , questions , questions , of course , questions , and of course , and I wouldn 't be done .
You know , it doesn 't only only mean that these workers are going to eat food for cans because they 're not going to have enough money , it means that the decision is so ostics that they also lose the funding of the dator of the work of the dator .
Not participating , they 're losing to five dollars in the dator of work , which would be very disposite to real .
So , the paralysis a consequence of having too much .
And I think it makes the world .
" And finish , for the ethernity : ketchup , feeling or maionese ? "
You just take the right decision , if it 's going to be for ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong source , and even the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second one is that we can avoid paralysis and do a choice , at the end , we 're less than than the result of how we would choose .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of conditions in which choose , if you buy one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you would have been better . And what happens is that the alternative imagine us . And what 's going on is that the alternative imaged us industry , and the reduce the subsidial recognize the fresh ,
And even when it was a good decision .
More choice , there 's more easy than any detered by any detailable than any detailable option of choice .
And there 's what economists economists call .
Dan Gilbert asked very well as a lot of stamatic things that we do depends on what we 're going to do .
In the rest , when there are a very possible options , it 's easy to represent the characteristics of the scared and be less than than the option that option is choice .
Here 's an example . I school with all those who are not New York .
But it 's what you probably think .
There 's this couple of Hamptons .
A place of luser .
It 's splendida . Oten day . It 's all about it .
Not any one . But what he thought he 's thinking , " Well , malth , it 's Agost . "
" All my neighbors at Manhattan is . "
" I could talk about front of the house . "
And it 's going to two weeks , from the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the chance of parking parking where it wants .
The decrease the decrease for what we have , even when choice was old .
And the more options we have to look at the more than the characteristic characteristics are going to be rescue .
Here 's another example .
This vignant us a lot of things .
It talks about living the moment , and maybe living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you 're going to do not do other .
The things that we don 't choose have a attractive attractive attractive what we do .
Third point : it 's going to be extremendous .
I tried it on my skin beating a new couple of jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were only one of the kind , buy , they were moving them a bad , they were moving , only after having them a life and swashed a lot of times , they started going to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple new when the old ones were going , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my wrong . "
The committed told me , " Laxphyslim , easy , relaxed ? "
Do you want to do it with the bottons or with the bottons ? "
" Do you want to do it ? "
" Sotle them want to large , you want to share it , " Bla ble , " Child 's ble to elenenenenenenenenenen-handing .
I was sitting , and after a little bit , I was able to say , " I want the kind of -- that was the only kind of , " I want to be the only kind of jeans , and then I tried to all the jeans , and then use the best jeans , and then use the best couple of jeans that I had ever had .
It was the massive . And that was the choice I had the better .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to figure it .
The reason I was worse is that with all the choice of the things that I was very high , jeans had to be perfect .
I was going to be tiny . I didn 't expect that excited about that , when it was only a kind of a kind , but when I live 100 different , hunger , at least a kind of a kind of perfect .
What I was bought , but not perfect .
After I had paragoned that choice with what I was trying to be in compared in the aspectations .
The add options in life of the people that do not increase the expected of the options that these are respect to the options of the same .
And this protection will least smooth , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing is connected .
Because if you know , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth more about this .
" The reason he was better when he was worse . " The reason he was better when he was worse , it was that when you was worse was going to be able to meet .
The world where we live in -- opulents , industrialized , industrialized industrialized with the expectancy -- we can hope is that things are at the height of expectation .
You never have surprised to be surprised because your expectations , you 're ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse expectative , " Yes , you want to . "
I mean , small autobiographic -- that I 'm really sitted and my wife is really stupend .
I wouldn 't have done .
But to be not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of jeans is only a couple of jeans is that when you 're not sitted , and I ask you , " Why ? "
" Who 's responsible ? " The answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a lot of them , and you ask you who 's responsible , it 's the responsible , it 's as a clear that responsible responsible .
You 're going to do better .
With hundreds of available , there are no excuses for the insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is , they 're walking , they feel introduced and they give the colcollip-themselves .
In the last few years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but the only one , but this is important -- of this depression is really that people have experiences because the standard is too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that colcolcollege is their .
So the end result is that we 're better , we 're going to be better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely false . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little choice is not to get a little bit better than it , but it doesn 't have a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magical value . I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm sure we 've been enough to be sure that we 've been on the level where choices are best our life .
Now , from the political point of view -- I 've almost finished -- from political point of view , the name is the following .
What allows you all this choice in industrial society is the material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem isn 't that they too much choice .
The problem is that they too little too little bit .
So the face of the easy I 'm talking about is a disease of modern , recognize society .
And what does to do is , and arrare this : Steve Levitt talked about how I 've been talking about how I constood and discovers to be inuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuseful .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dispendispendeful , it 's not just inuseful .
I 'm adaptops .
They do worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows choice was reversed in those where people are too few possibility , it would be not only their life to improvement , but also our life .
This is what economists call a pareting improvement .
A redistribution of the refinger does good at all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in excess that we go back .
And to conclude , " Father , you can become everything you want to be .
You know , people are you going to think , " What does it make that fishing ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get it into a glass . "
" A imagination imagination , a limited vision of the world --
And I 'm interpreted it so , at the beginning .
But then , thinking about it , instead , I realized that the weight .
Because the reality of fact , if you eat the bocks , so that , " all you can 't get the freedom . You don 't get the freedom .
If you take the bocks in a way that all you can decrease .
You get to go to the paralysis , and you 'll reduce the well-being .
And they need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the axis , a smooth symbolic sphere is a recipe for infecity and , for rovine .
Thank you very much .
