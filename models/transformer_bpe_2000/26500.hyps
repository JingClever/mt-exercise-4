And I showed this year I showed these slides to show that the glacial calculations , which for almost three million years had the size of the United States , it 's reduced 40 percent .
But this is the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice .
The artics calculations is , in a way , the heart of global climate system .
It 's winter expanding and you get summer .
The next slide is going to be a fast-25 years old .
The ice lost lost lost drawn .
And you see , they expand , they get up until .
That is the inverinter , which is the inverinter , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you get sumer .
You can see the cosidgn , along five years or more , is like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood ,
In 25 years , it was so far from this .
This is a problem because the warming is the whole terrain , the ground around the ocean artical terrain where there are huge amount of coal congeled that , the slightly , they 're transformed in the microbes .
And I 'm going to the totality of global atmospected , that amount of global warming , that amount could double , superformance this point of not around .
In some laghs , in Alaska , the deep already sent on the water .
The professority Katey Walter of Alaska of Alaska , you recently , you 've got to a team with a team , you know ,
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You 're good . The question is if we 're going to be us .
A reason is that this term is that this term Greenland from North .
This is a glacial reme .
The brought it never reached levels .
This is the Kangerlusaq , in the west southwest of Greenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of sea level of the mall of terraferal , here is where you reach the sea .
These corrups are increasing rapidly .
Another of the planet : Antarcticks of the planet .
The month of the scientists have clear that the balance of the ice is in negative , and that Antarctica , which is a pogls of some issues in some ises of some issues of some issues in the slightly slightly in the slightly slightly .
That is six meters of the switches , like Greenland in Greenland .
On Himalayas , the third greatest block of ice , you see new laghi , which few years ago were a few years ago ,
40 percent of the world 's population was half of the water as the slightly as the slightly as the slightly as the slightly as the slightly as well as the slightly as the slightly as the slightly as the slightly as the slightly as the slightly as the slightly as the slightly as the slightly as the slightly as well .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the source of this city .
The brought is increased .
But when you diminishes , the same happens to be powerful .
In California , the snow on Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The backkkay is in crisis .
People , like you read , they 're flex .
The growing growing is a remarkable increasing the incends .
The environmental disasters are increasing out of the normal and without precedental and without precedental .
Four times more number of the number of 75 years , I think of it 's 75 .
This is a whole thing that is unsustainable .
If you look at it in the storytellical consequences .
In the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 24 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look at attention the East Pacific area , the Americas to the Americas , to the Americas , and the west parts of the subcontinent , where there is a imately imately imately imately imately imately in the oceans .
The major causes of global warming , with deforestation , which is 20 percent of fossil fuel .
oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with China .
And he was going to build a lot of other mix coal .
But we 're seeing at a change of direction .
These are native projects in the last years and some of alternative , and some alternative versus .
And every way , there 's a lot of politics in our country .
The coal industries and oil have 250 million dollars in the last year to promote coal , which is a lit gold .
And I remember something that --
I 'm Natale in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion liters of coal switches .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the greater flow of scories in America .
It 's successful around Natale .
The publicity nature of one of the coal industries was this .
Video : Without of carbon is a plegro and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
Frosty the carbon is more and more and more .
It 's good , adorable , and the workers are keeps .
Al Gore : Al Gore is here is a lot of the coal of West Virginia .
The greatest mineral society is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankage : : I 'll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for Clima 's Proteition , and I put two campaiged campaiged two campaiged campaiged two campaign .
This is a part of them , one part .
Video : Actor : ALergy see the climate change as a threat of the business .
So , our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a effort to make public and make the truth and confused to make coal and confused to coal .
So , coal is not spored .
We think it 's not clean -- it 's also a good smoke .
So , not preocupateves of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Carbone , you heard of it -- you 've heard a lot of it .
So , you know , a turn in a structure at the pattern of the coal bone .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noise , but that 's the sound of the technology of clean .
The coal consumption is between the main global warming , but the night 's technology , the path of coal warming technology , you see changes everything .
You have a look , this is the wood 's technology of clean .
Al Gore : Indeed , the good positive is connects to economic issue and the national security .
Video : Coming : America is in America is in America , the national security , the national crisis .
The field that the connects all of our fossil fuel , like the pattern and oil and oil oil .
Now , though , there 's a new , car , solution for used to use it .
Repower America : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A piano to put America to work , make sure , make sure sure , and help us to stop global warming .
So , it was a solving that solve to solve our problems .
Repower America . You cover more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Coming : It 's re-giving energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to bring the end of the combustible dependence that killing our planet .
What 's the future is here . I 'm going to say , a sole , a new energy network .
What you know , two : Noves investment for a bad job .
Coming : Repower America . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old old old African old old African says , " If you want to go fast , you go to the only .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
And I did it at TED , I did an introduction in LHC .
And I promise to travel to travel about how the machine works .
So , there I 'm . And for those that the other time , there were no , the greatest scientific experiment ever -- 27 miles of circuit .
His task is to remember the conditions that were at less than a billion a second of the universe -- until the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
And it 's just environment .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
We spent these mini-Big Bang Bang inside the relationship .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- it 's 44 meters and has a diameter of 22 meters .
This is an extent of ATLAS , you can see the proportion .
Ten September last year we have access the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was immense to huge control in control .
It 's a picture of the first particles that had done all the LHC picture , both in collision , by a part of the LHC , and it spread particles in the LHC , and spread particles in the relator .
In other words , when we see that picture that picture 10 September , we understand that the machine worked , which is a great victory .
I don 't know if that was this to do this , when somebody went to Google and he saw that the page was this .
That means that we had a cultural impact beyond that scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , you had to these flows here -- these dorries here -- these dorries .
These files are taking 13,000 printing when the machine works at the power of power .
Now , the technicians between you look at the files and tell , " It 's not true . I 'm trouble . I 'm too ticky . "
And they can do it because when they 're very cold site became the site djects .
So , at less 271 degree , at a temperature in the space between the stars , these flows can bring that corrate .
In one of the juntures in the LHC magnets in the LHC , there was a fect of fectory .
So the flows up slightly , and the 13,000 printing print , they met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnets more than 20 tons , and that you have about 30 tons , and that have been about 30 centimeters .
They 're saying about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we did .
We restined them and address .
Now they 're coming back to their place .
By the end of the march of the LHC is is again .
We 're going to accinate it , and we 're expecting to jumps or lightly , and we 're going to go so our adventure to find what are the morning of the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents reach the debate on the value of science and engineering in frontier . It 's easy to confutting .
I think that 's so hard to go beyond the way to go beyond the value of things like the LHC .
I 'd like to end with the words of a Ingls , Humphrey Davy Davy , which , I imagine , in defense , defense , the experiments of his puppille was Michael Faraday , said , " Nient is so dangerous for the human 's 's ideas , which is not a mixture of the ideas are definitive , which is not mixture of our worldwishes , and that are not in the souldn 't be new worldwished , and that we don 't have to be in the word of our words of consters .
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to start thinking about when you , from kids , you play with them , you play with the morning .
And as you get to realive and you get them , and you learn them , and you learn to think about and solving problems and solving problems and slightly problems and manipulating relationships .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand the world around us .
So , from the uses of our interaction with our physical objects , with my conon Patts , and my conon Patts , and my conon Patts , and I started to ask me , " And if we use a computer , instead of having only a computer , rather than having only a computer , rather than the digital clabstry that moving information with both a desktop , we can deal with physics ,
and you get to sistemle ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the answer , and I building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable , a Siften interactive , like a bike .
In a few words , a Siftable , a Siften interactive , like a bike .
You can move with your hand , they can see their hand , they can see their movement and they have a screen and a radio screen and a radio screen .
But most physical objects , like physical objects , you can just move them .
Siftable of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate information .
And as they get more physical , conscious knowledge of the other , and as they get more physical , conscious , of the other , of how we move , we can explore new and different kinds of interaction .
I 'll start with a few simple example .
This Siftable is configurated to show video : if you include it in a direction , the video running like this , if you including it back .
These interacts are conscious of others .
If you 're interested in , you know what they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they 're circular , they notice it and they can act a little bit .
If they 're circular , they notice it and they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclines .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power of the data , for example , to talk about a color like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , the sat of the vernice and I can use them to the color in the middle , where they missing .
and I can use them to take color in that central color , where they mix .
We can get too much , we can reput a little place .
And they 're also beautiful possibilities of learning , like languages , mathematics and logic and logic and logic things where people can try and see the results of the results , and you see the results of it .
Now , I 'm --
This is a Fibonacci sequence that I do with a equations of equations .
Here we have a word of words that is half between Scarabean and Boggle .
Pratically , at every turn a letter to every Siftable , at every Siftable , at every turn to any letter in every Siftable , and while certainly certain people in a dipacking ditionary .
And then , after about 30 seconds , you get a new set of letters and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here 's kids came in the Media Lab , I did it so that they tried them and I spent them a video .
They were very fleased .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people many education .
You just say , " What 's about words , " and they know exactly what to do .
And so that other people who are trying to .
This is our younger head , there on the right .
It actually wanted to take them .
They were only making morning , for him .
Now , this is a whole application of a interactive chardter .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of the Lui languages is Felix .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving the Siften , they can be running .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving the Siften , they can be running .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sunlight is .
David Merrill : Now brought a treat the scene .
Video : The arange treator .
By ! Yes .
So I school with Siftable and put nearly nearly can interact with characters --
Video : Bau !
and by inventing their own story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It 's a wind story with the final , and it can decide him how it comes .
DM : It 's a wind story with the final , and it can decide him how it comes .
Video : Volling , cat .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , realized , to figure out , to fire out and execting music .
It 's a tool , realized , to fix and execting music .
Siftable here are growing from sound like base , based and bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also be insert of these sound in a sequence to you or pleasure .
And they just modify to make it a sound and a sequence .
These are actually , you can control from the vive , like the reverbs and the filter .
I 'm going to a particular sound and then including it .
And then there are the general effects as time and fly , that you applicate the whole sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : DM : We 'll start put a base in two Siftable , " sequence , " we 're going to the extend , we add other basic .
Now I put a low line .
Video : DM : Now , I add percussions --
Video : And I 'll put the philtruck , so I can control the effect of the vive .
DM : DM : I can fall the whole sequence to inclinding the whole sequence by one side or the other .
Video : And I 'll add the filter to the low to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can tell the flight .
So I don 't have to get it first , but I can improvise it , make it longer or more corta .
And now , finally , I can make the whole sequence inclinding the whole sequence inclinding the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new mand more more like the machine and more like our brain and the body works and the body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the result of this , and also some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmit is coming up this new generation of designed objects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writer .
I 'm to writing books is my profession , but it 's more than that .
It 's also love and my life .
And I don 't expect to change .
But I said that , something particular happened in my life and in my life , and in my career , which brought me to realibrate the whole thing .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called Manogy , Prega , Ama , " which , diversed from my previous books , for some reason that I used to get a great sensational , for some reason to get out in the world and became a big sensational .
And the result is that everywhere I 'm going to go , people treat me as if I was condanned .
Do -- condanned , condannated .
They go from me now , everybody worry and say , " Don 't you fear of being able to do better ?
You don 't fear to keep writing for all life without being able to create a book that can important somebody ? "
what can important ? "
It 's required , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that the more 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent adolescent -- I was a tremendous adolescent .
I met the same reaction of the same reaction .
And people said , " Don 't temes that you can 't have succeed ?
Don 't you fear that the ubility of the reflicense you ?
You 're not to be fear of doing this for all life without that nothing is to be out and to die on a cumouth of a cumouth of fallisong with the douth of fallisent with the fallisong ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short response to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I fear of all those things .
I always had fear of fear .
And I also fear of many other things that people could not have to have .
As the other things are very excavently .
But , as I think about write that I was , and I wonder , why is why is it ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logic that anyone who has been wait to be spent by a job that you can do .
But what 's so particular in the impress creative impress to make nervous about health , in a way that other careers don 't do ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember one time in his 40 years of activities where he was asked if he was achieving ?
Never -- that block of the engineer John , how do you ?
Don 't you know ?
Onthrees , chemicals like group , they don 't certainly have no , in the secows , the reputation of being handed to be alcolized .
We have enough , we have enough , this reputation , and not just writers , but creative to every gender , we have this reputation of being huge instable to be enormous instaable .
And I 'm not remarkable to look at the sad death of the magnification of the minds of the minds of the minds of the creative dead , they die and often for them .
And the ones that are not suicipate data seem to be actually dismiss by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he die in the last interview said , " Every my book has killed a little more . " A extraordinary affermation about the work of their life .
But we 're not bad at the end , when we feel that we heard these things that in some way we 've got completely internal and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering is somehow , and you know , and that art , at the end , will be hard to the end , will be during the ancient .
And the question I want to bring everybody here today is : you agree with this idea ?
You know , it 's good for me , because he looks at a hundred direction for nothing .
I think it 's hating .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see perpetuated in the section .
I think it 's better encourage our great creative minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start to fire that I was supposed to be a little bit of supposed to be a lot of the circumstances in which I 'm in my career .
That 's what you 're looking at , I 'm young , I 'm pretty young , I have about 40 years .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that whatever I 'm going to be judged by the world as the work that I used after spent specual success of my book .
I 'm slavery , because we 're all about friends here -- it 's likely that my greatest success is to my shouldn 't be in my wild .
Oh , Gesu , which thought !
You know this is the gender of thinking that leads a person to start to behind a person , and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep to keep doing this work that I love .
So , the question becomes , how do you , what ?
And so it looks at me , after many reflections , that the way to work to keep write is to create a psychological costrutt , right ?
I have to find a security of security between me , which I 'm write , and my natural anxiety about which reaction can get it . And as I was trying to do it , and as I was trying to do it , and I was looking through the time , trying to find other societies to see if they could have better ideas and more healthy ideas and more healthy .
about how to help people think about creative creative inherent people 's emotional to make creativity .
And that 's taken me to ancient Great and ancient Rome .
I 'm going to drive because it goes back into circle and then back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity was sleep , OK ?
And it was thought that creativity was this spirit of this is about the becomes and that was to men from someone who 's sources and unknown , for distant distant and unknown .
The Greeks called these spirits of creativity of creativity .
Socrate , wonderfully , he believed to have a demon that elarts would be swisdom from away .
Romanifs were the same idea , but they called that spirit without a genius .
That 's great , because the Romanifi , because the Romanize didn 't really think that a genius was a little smart .
They think that a genius was this kind of entity that would be lived in literally in the walls of a artist , a little bit like the elfo Dobby , and that came out of an artist , and that came out of the job and model the outside of that work .
That 's the distance of -- that 's the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological costruction that protected you from your work .
And everybody knew that it was so that it worked , right ?
So the ancient artists were protected by certain things , like , for example , right ?
If your work was exceptional , you could not take all of the goods , everybody knew that you were helped by this genius .
If your failed job , it wasn 't all be your , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable .
And so the people han concept creativity in West for a long time .
And then Renasciance came and everything changed , and this big idea , and we put this big idea ; we put human being in the center of the universe and misters and and more and no leaving space to the creatures that they write by divinity .
This was the Remiddle of humanity and people started to think that creativity was completely by ishared idividought .
And for the first time in the story , you started to refer this or that artist like a rather than a genius to a rather than a person with the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think that allow someone , a simple person to believe that you can be like a recipient as the source , the source of all the divins , inknown , creative and inconscious , incognized , inalive and a responsibility to Africa 's source .
It 's like to get someone to inguive the sun .
Deform and you completely , the ego and it creates all of these inextremendous things about performance .
And I think it was this pressure to address the artists in 500 years .
And if that 's true , and I think that is , the question is , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mistery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would be lawyers that would be lawyers , you know , insom that they follow people , you know , you know , you know , they follow people to spent their projects .
I 'm probably not going to convined you all about this .
But the question I would like to bring is -- why is not ?
Why don 't think it in this way ?
Because it 's more sense of everything that I 've ever heard to explain the exassumption of the creative imprevebility of the process .
A process that , as anyone who ever ever loved to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- knows , you know , you know , it doesn 't buy .
And in fact , it can sometimes it looks completely completely paranormal .
I did this meeting recently with the extraordinary poetetesse Ruth Stone , which has now 90 years , but it was a poetsh for all life and said to me that she was a poetesis in the Virginia , working out in the Virginia , and he felt in the field , and he was in the poem .
And he said that it was like a slightly air .
And that was rotating to her from landscape .
He was to hear , because it was so much to be tremendous .
He knew you to have one thing to do at that point and it was , words , " you know , " I want to run like a major .
And then it comes to the home and they wouldn 't have to make it another piece of paper and a fairly , a fast of paper and a fairly , and it would be fast , and he would raise and fairly , and he wouldn 't make it on the page .
Other times , it wasn 't enough , so it would be fastly , and it would be run and then you run without to the home and poetry her through and she would keep up through the landscape and she would keep in the landscape , and he said , " another poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece of time -- this piece I never forgotten it -- there were almost losing , right ?
So , he was running up to the house and was trying to card and the poem was just saying it up a cell in the way that was going to go , and then she said , that it was like to slow down with the hand and the willing .
And he was the poem of the tail and he would put it in his body and she was to page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page and it 's the one that 's precisely , the first word .
So when I felt it -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly equal to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a mule , and my way to work is , you wake up to the same oraries every day and then to work and take and then you go and to work and go on and spend and you go on and spend .
But even I , in my head , I bought against that thing , at times .
And I guess that many of you have this .
You know , even if the work and ideas were given me from a certain source , I can 't know , you know ,
And what is that ?
And how can we relate to it to be able to do it , but , rather , rather , what does it remains us ?
As I think , the best example of me , the best example of the Tom Waits , which I have a Tom Waits , which I have a different years ago for a paper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most life was the incarnation of the artist 's been involved in the contemporary artist , trying to control , and to control these species of creative impulses .
But then I 'm involved , and I went to drive up a driving autostrada in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
It was going to be fast and all of a sent tracross this little piece of melody , which comes in his head as inspiration , and the wild , and the wild , you know , it 's wonderful , and it doesn 't know how to take it .
It has a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a math , it doesn 't have a meeting .
So he begins to hear this kind of old anxiety is growing in him , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'll be obsessed by this song , and I 'll be rebring it from this song , and I 'll be able to lose .
I 'm not enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , they stop .
I 'll be the whole process , and he made something completely new .
I 'm going to look at the sky and said , " Don 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" You know , " Do you know a song now ?
If you really want to be , back to a more opports when I can take care of you .
And you go to important somebody else today .
You know , I 'm going to disturban . "
And his process , he was changed after this .
Not the work , the job was still knowing like .
But the process , and the weighed was required when the genius , the genius that was caused to him to the genius , the genius that was going to be sent , and then he remained it back where they came from , and made that he wasn 't a internal thing and gone .
but it 's just about this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange and external thing that allowed and it was not Tom .
So , as the story started changing a little bit of the way I was working , and I was saved to me .
And I writing , I was writing " Manogy , Prega , Ama , and fall in one of those cave cave in the dispersonal that we 're working on something and we can 't start thinking that it 's going to be a disaster , which is going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst ever .
Not just the worst book .
And I started to think about gone .
But then I remember about Tom that talked about air and I tried to do it .
So you zoom in in the mantis the sought and I realized my hundred of a vacuum .
And I said to high voices , " Well , what do you , you both know , if this book is not going to be interacted with my , no ?
Because as I 'm put it up with me everything I have , I don 't have any more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to present , and make your part .
Okay . But if you do it , you know what , I don 't do .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my job .
And I would like to make my part that I 've been shown to me to do my part , " Because at the end is so , you know , it 's like this , secows ago in the deserts of the North people who were sitting for damaged to the middle-hour and and music that they were sacred to the hours and hours .
And they were always magnification , because the ballers were professional and they were wonderful .
But every one of them , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists would actually actually transendent .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you all see it , at a point , a performance like that .
It was like the time stopped , and the balls walked through a kind of a bral balls and walked through a kind of different from the usually , like 1,000 nights before , but all of the 1,000 nies before , but all of the time , you would be swalked through .
And at the suddenly not appeared as a human .
But you get accurate from the divineted and under the slightly in the divinity .
And when this was happening , the people knew what they called him his name .
They knew the hands and started to cantar , " Allah , Allah , God , " God . "
That 's God , you know .
Curious known -- when the More invading the south of the Spain , I got this habitude with them and he changed to the coli " Allah , Allah , " " " Ols , " that 's the Ols , " that you can still hear the corride or in the floor .
In Spain , when a artist has done something impossible and magical , " Allah , words , " Allah , " I 'm good , " ununderstandable , " I 'm God .
And it 's great because we need .
But the problem is the next day , for the balls , when you wake up and you discover that the 11 of the morning of Marteduts and the God of Nig .
It 's just a wort-wild mortal to the ginocka , and maybe it will never be able to hear that alteeth .
And maybe nobody can switness the name of God still while it 's going to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful recognize to make life .
But maybe it has to be so angot-force , if you can 't believe , mosquare , that the most extraordinary expects of your being being from yourself .
But you just think you have to be prested by a unimaginable source of this source of your life is part of your life that you have to get to somebody else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think it 's all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly like this for a different months of the book that I would published for it , the dangerous , and I 'm going to do it , exithous , exighborhood , I was followed by my great success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel elected by this is , not having to be able to be .
Don 't just go . It 's just your work .
It 's a depressing to your side , any part , any of any way to be .
If your work is to slow , bad .
If the divine , you know , you know , you know , he assigned a few kinds of wonderful , for one moment through your efforts , for one moment through your efforts , then "
You do the same thing , you do the same dance .
And " Ole ! " at yourself . "
I think we have to teach it .
" Olay ! " at yourself , just for having love and touching tals to make you continued to present continues .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And as you know , I talked about some of these projects on the human genome , about what can mean and the new genes of genes .
Now we 're beginning to digitalize biology and now we started to digitalize biology and now to start that digital code we 're coming in a new phase of biology , designing and synthetic life .
We 've always been trying to bring up largely .
What is life ? " is something that many biologists I think they have been trying to understand slightly livels .
We tried different approaches , reduced to the minimals .
We 're digitalizing almost 20 years old .
When we sequenced the human genome was treating the analogical world of biology in the digital world .
Now , let 's ask us : can we regenerate life , or new from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome that can self-laboratorate ,
And we tried to reduce the genome to get one more smaller .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 genes that are here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
I think that 's simple .
But when we look at the genes we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very improbable that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to progrew this was synthesize this cromosome to be able to get the components to bring out the components to bring some of these questions fundamental questions .
And so we started the " Can we synthetic cromosome ? "
Can the chemistry connecting these great molecules that we never could make these great molecules that we never could make before ?
And in case , we can make a cromosome , can we work a cromosome ?
A cromosome is simply a chemistry of chemistry material .
The speed that we 're able to digitalize life is growing exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , procredit , rather slowly , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results is bring it on a exponential curve .
We started more 15 years ago .
The process required a lot of passages , beginning with a bioetic review before we began to the first experiments .
But we found that that synthesize DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousand machines of DNA , the longest segment of 30 to 50 letter , and it 's a degenerative process : the more segment is more than the segment is longer , the more segment is longer , the more errors are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembling these framments and correct errors .
And this was our first attempt to start by information digital genome of Phi 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills kills .
We designed the fragments , effectively correction of errors and get a molecule of DNA about about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemistry material inhert and we put it in bacteria , bacteria have beginning to read this genetic code and to produce the viral particles .
The viral particles have been required by the cell , are back and they destroyed .
I talked about recently with membrings of the oil industry , which they have certainly compressed this model .
They recognized you .
We think that this is a situation where software can actually build his own hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the bigger .
We wanted to build the whole cromosome of bacterium .
They 're over 580 mies letters of genetic code .
So we thought I would build it in seven of the virus of the size of the virus , so that you can change the cassettes of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard , it was a herror for every 10 mies .
We found , resequency , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence of original sequence , we would never be able to do it .
One part of the process is designing long long , 50 letters that they have to be survive with all the other segments of 50 letters to build more small undercity that word together .
We project the only thing here .
You probably have a little bit of the bed .
Think of it : We have a genetic code about four letters : A , C , Gs and T.
Three of those letters together codify about 20 lots , and there is a specific order to shall of the love for every adminoacide .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , framework , framework , framework , framework , framework , framework , framework , framework , frames .
What we did in the beginning was self-doing .
Some of them were used to be used by the fact that it wasn 't poetry .
We designed these segments to be just to join it .
There are enzy that repair them and put them assime .
And we started assembling to be a lot of the parts , by five to segments from five to segment , unending them to segment segment to be forming segment of 24 mies letters .
So we have these segments in abundance , so that we 're trying to make a very tremendous process of creating a extremely robustood -- as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatizing the process .
So , this looks like the tabellon a basket .
When we get to these very long segments , the more than 100 miles , they 're not going to grow more directly in the Ecoli .
It comes to the molecular limits of modern tools of biology .
So we looked at other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination , which in biology is use to recombination to reach the DNA can une the segments .
Here is an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , it can absorbed three million rads .
You can see in the superior as his chromosome is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly like it was before .
They have thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be sitting completely .
They can live under a vacuum .
They 're absolutely certainly life in space , and you could find new water environments .
ASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processes , simply using the lights with the design of the segments of the segments to insert .
The least assemble them , the car .
This picture is not taken with a microscope with a microscope , but with a tremendous microscope .
It 's a molecule that we can see it with a lawy-discopy .
These are pictures that they cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publication we did .
They 're over 580,000 lets of genetic code .
It 's the greatest molecule of a defined structure that man ever .
It has a molecular weight at 300 million .
If we stammed with a 10 without spaces , you would like 142 pages to transform this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How do we get it ?
Of course , you love a virus is a young game .
It 's a little more complicated when they use bacteria .
It 's also simpler when it comes to ekarios as our : You can just extract the nucleus and insert of it , which is basically the clonation process .
In the bacterium , the blind cell is instead of integrated instead of a cell , but we have recently demonstrated that we are able to make a transplant by a cell to another and activity .
We can refed a cromosom from a microbial species .
The two are different as mouse as the men .
We have added a few gene gene that you can decide what I choose for this chromosome .
And then the skies with the enzes to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell cell was study -- and you open our sophisticatogies -- the new cromosome of cell cell .
And we thought that we wouldn 't go beyond , but we tried to spinhering more in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms evolution .
We found that many species have added to a second or a third cromosom somewhere , added in a thousands of tracks in a thousands of tracks .
So who think about evolution as a only gene gene that you can 't understand the biology of biology .
And they 're called the restriped restrition that would be diger-diger-inhery .
The cromosome that was in the cells , you know one .
The cell phone that we 've inserite cell .
And it 's expressed , and it recognized the other chromosom as a expensive material , and we were we found with only the cells and cell cell cell and the new cromosome .
it became blue because of the genes that we 've insered .
And in a short time , all the characteristics of a species have been allowed , and it turned out to a new species , based on the new species that we put in the cells .
Everybody 's proteins are changed , and when we read the genetic code of the exactly of what we 've been transfer to what we 've been transfer .
Now , this could look altering genetic , but it can be at DNA , we can change the things in a way way of such altering .
Now , I 've already explained that you 're not talking about genesis -- but we 've been progress from three and a half years and a half evolution , and I 've said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion that they will be created new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's obvious when we think about our necessity .
We 're going to spend six billion people in nine billion in the next 40 years .
Right for example , I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 , there will be four .
We 're going to have problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicinals and gas for six billion and a half billion and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more telling to nine billion .
We use more than five billion coal , more than 30 billion coal baries .
That means millions of the day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of processes to reducing them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep connected about all the hemissions of CO2 from these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
At day , thank you to scientific discovery in all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are designed for the future .
The electronics that only is a dozen about a dozen about components , and think about how many different things came out .
Our limits here is basically the biological data and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , thanks to these rapid metods of synthesization , that we call combatory genomics combatory .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million cromosomes a million cromosomes a day .
Think of them , you know , 20 million genes or to try to get the processes to make either optimize or drugs , new vaccines , new vaccines , and we can change , because of a little team , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for a possibility of survival , production , chemical or fuel , production of vaccine , etc .
This is an instant instantany of some software programmed that we 're working for to be able to seat and design species to the computer .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how they will be .
We know exactly what they 're genetic code .
We 're focusing on the fuel of fourth generation .
You also saw that extract from the grate was a finite experiment .
We have a lot of second-third generation that will be surroundary , as well as a high as a high or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without increasingly increased the cost of food and limitate the cost of food and limited to be transforming CO2 in matter before , which we 're working for working for design cells that can reach this , and we think we could have the first generation of the first generation in about 18 months .
The sunlight sunlight -- but in our discoveries is a metodowntown , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the ocean , about 2500 feet of deep depth of ebollition of water .
They reach out of CO2 using molecular hydrogen as energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can incancer CO2 , which can be transported by the way , converting that CO2 in fuel , to drive that CO2 in the fuel , to drive this process .
So , we think that we might think that we could be able to increase what the basic question of what is life is what is life is Nice , versus , and we have the goal of reduced oil .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where can ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And we 're working to use the same metods to make the same methods to make instantaneous vaccines .
You saw this year with the influence , we 're always back to a year and with a dollar in less when it 's true to be fair .
I think that you can change building combination .
And that 's how the future could start seem changing changing , now , the tree of evolution , acceping the evolution with bacteria , and you would say , and finally at eucariote .
We 're so much as the best people .
Our purpose is to try enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all of all the most quickly possible , some fundamental job , the new technology that we brought to Microsoft , the new technology that we brought to a bad , almost a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment that you can interact is at local level that remote with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of digital gigabyte photographs with a kind of zostant and , for a panoramic speed , and a panoramic speed , we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information we see , how big these are these gathering data or images or images .
Most of the Congress are digital photographs , but this is a scanning provent from the Biblioowner of Congress , and we get in the 300 megapixel .
Not any difference because the only thing that limits the only thing that is the number of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not .
This is the Dickens . Every colonn represents a chape .
And to show you that it 's just about it and not images , we can do something like that , to make something like that , to make a real representation of the rest , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little electronic book .
Not you .
This is a more realistic . It 's a number of The Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful version of a cartacy or a quotidian , which is for nature or a quotidian , which is for nature a moltle .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of The Guardian .
We created a higher publicity , higher than that you use in a normal advertising -- and we put in a normal publicity -- and we put you into the extra content .
If you want to see the caracteristics of this automobile , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate limits of space on screen .
We hope that that means to put end up to the pop-up and other parts like , you don 't have to be necessary .
Of course , the map applications is one of the obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if we don 't say that we have contributs to this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , a geospatial picture of NASA .
So , we 're going to see something else .
This is actually , by the wild , you can go to the web ; you can go to .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research a very interesting research by Noah Snavority of Washington of Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Siskeli , the UW and of Microsoft Rick Szeliski .
And it 's from Seb , gested by Seadragon .
You can see that when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from a picture and have this kind of experience to have this picture of redemand .
But the space of the images here actually has a significance .
The algorithms of visualization computers have recorded these images together , so that they correspond to the real place that images -- all of the exists that images -- all of these scale , and they 're taking close to the Grases in the Montagne Rocockpiles of a sli-stable show , and these things are all the space space space space , and these things are all the space space space are all all all the space space space space space space space .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space .
I want to spend to one of the original data , Noahhholding , and this is from a prototype of Photosynth that we did for the first time the scort scort -- to show you what I think is the key behind this , the technology Photosynth . And it 's not necessarily evident to look at the environments we put in the website .
We had to worry about laws and forced .
This is a rebuild the Notre catthedral of Notre Dame picture of Flickr . Baast , you can digitar Notre Dame in Flickr and you get images of these kinds of magicions , other campus and so on . Each of these arancions , you know , you know , the camera is discovery of this model .
So , they 're all picked up with Flickr and they were all connected to this way .
And it 's possible to be born in this way simple .
You know , I would never have thought about the end of the work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying to get this kind of accounters here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different types of phones that are mobile phones in the phones , the phones at SLR , a significant number of meaning , put together in this environment .
And if I can try to be a lot of those strange .
Many of you block , etc .
So , somewhere here is a series of photographs -- and that 's .
This is a poster of Notre Dame recorrectly correctly .
We can spend from the poster , the vision of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the college of how term is that we can do the land , from visual memory -- and connecting everybody else .
All those pictures are connected together , more than the sum of parts .
You have a model of the whole thing that emerging .
Think about this as a prolungment of Stephen Lawler 's work .
It 's something that is growing in complexity as people who use it , and the advantages to the use of the use of increasing .
Their picture are smart with other people .
If someone is the idea of the idea of those data saying the name , my photographs of Notre catthedral of Notre catthedral of all those data , and I can use it for all those data , and I can use it for immerging in that space , in that metaphing , using the photographing , in that metaphing , in that metaphimes , in that methas-mobile photo and red social experience .
Of course , a consequence of all this is extremely extremely elaborate any interesting pattern of any interesting than any airplanes of the Earth , collective , and satellite images and satellite and similar , but from the college memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software is that you will be able to do is that a certain point in the next years , all the photographs , all the photographs , all the photographs , all the photographs , all the photographs ?
AA : Yeah . What 's doing is doing is discover .
It 's creating hyperlinks , if you want , you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the basic contents .
What 's really interesting if you think about the recurcing security of security that many of these images are possibly these images .
As you make a picture of images on the web , you digite a frase and the text page on the web page has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what if that picture is you connects to all your photographs ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of wealth and the amount of reception that is really huge . It 's a classic classic classic classic .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible . It 's really incredible .
BAA : Tringrate .
One of the main pleasure when you travel and one of the search of the ethnographics , the power of the anti-traditions , between who have no forgotten the anti-traditions , the wind , the touch in the wind , the wind of the rain , you guess is in the floor of plants .
Basti thinking that sciamani Jaguar travel even even even the Via Lattea , or that the old Inuit is still travel , or that in Himalayas , the buddds are still model of Dharma , to remember the important of the major of the major makes the important of the world of the major eventually , it 's a model model of fact , but it 's just a model model of fact ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our strops is done , well or bad , a lot of generations ago .
And of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
We all are born . Everybody procrew .
We are subjects at the beginning of the initiation .
We need to deal inexorability of death , so it doesn 't surprising and you 're saying if we cancer and ballize --
We all have an art .
What hits is the species of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
Not that they 're the Penan 's 's the Borneo 's Borneo , or the following of Haiti , or the wern of the Kenya , or the desert Kenya , or a Sahara , the Curandering in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak of Qomolangered in the valley of Qomolangerous , on the world .
All of these populations teachers are teaching that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of music in the world .
And if you reflect a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
And then , the miriades of culture of the world 's kind of spiritual life and culture that 's culture that 's going to be able to well-being and culture of the planet as the planet as the as the ragal nature as a biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural ragal , like a , and you can say the som of the total ethnosphere , the total of all the concepts , inspirations , ideas , inspirations , inspirations , intuitions , intuition , powerful , intuitions , inspiring , inspiring ,
The etnosphere is the patrimony of humanity .
It 's the symbl of what we 're and what we can be in as inquisitive .
And as the biosphere was free , it was just a lot of it happened to ethnosfhere and purely much more .
No biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent of all species has been or about the extinction of the extinction simply because it 's false -- in the most open-pocalypothic , in the field of biological diversity -- and you don 't even even even even even as much as a different cultural .
The index of all that is , of course , the pursuit of language .
When you 're born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the shake of human spirit .
It 's the half that the animal is that the animal is in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a backin , a thought ecosystem of spiritual possibility .
And those 6,000 languages , as we 're here sitting in Monterey , at least half is not more surrunning in the ears of the kids .
They 're not teached to kids , the who means , unless you wouldn 't figure out something , which are already dead .
What 's more sad than being the silence , the last to be the last to talk to a language , the not to have to transmit , not to transmit the way of transmitting in the promise or anancient promise the promise of ?
This remember was someone in the world every two weeks of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a high high , and brings with the tomber syllabe .
And I know somebody who 's going to say , " Isn 't better ?
The world would be a better place if we talk all the same language ? " Well , we talk , then we talk to all yoruba . We talk canton .
Let 's talk kogs .
You 'll cover a tract thing that means not to talk about his language .
I would like to do you a journey through the labels --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a assage of what we 're losing .
Many of us to forget that when I say , " different ways of existing really different ways of existing .
So let 's take for example , Barasana , in Amazon , the popular sites , the popular saconda , which credies the sacond of the sacred latte of the sacred patents .
It 's a popular that is not able to distinguish the blue because the green because it has been identified in the forest , which depends the popular , which is the popular popular .
They have a strange language and a glad rule , he said , " You have to know , " You have to move a different language . " You have to move a different language .
And it all sorts of the past , yet the particular cotable is that in these families that are talks about six or seven language because of marriages , because of marriages , no one language .
They 're just going to listen to listen to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribe , which I lived , the Waorani in Ecuador , a incredible popular popular that has been the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have taken a committing a factor .
They did it takes up the photographs that they had a few people who were in a few adichevoles , forest that this popular population , and this popular forest that this popular forest .
They 've got the photographs , they turned to the research of a form or a figure and , you find nothing , they would be treated that they would be attacking the district , and they killed the five missionaries with the lance .
But Waorani is not just killed straneiers .
They killed in them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We 're risking high generations and we found two of natural death and when we stopped to know , they loved that one of them was invited so that he was invited so that he was invited by by by reverse , and then they killed it itself . They had a incredible knowledge of the forest .
The crawers could recognize the urine animal from 40 steps and recognize it .
In the early ' 80s , I had been assigned a very interesting task when my Harvard assigned me if I wanted to go to Haiti to the intraction of the secret society of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes and the Tonton Macoutes and the Macoutes , and impossessing of the speed to the zombies of the speed of the fast used to the zombies of the fast in the early ' 80s .
To give a sense of miracy , I would have to understand the Vodoo culture that Vodoo and the Vodoo is not magnitude .
It 's pretty much than a complex metaphysical vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Budddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always let out think that sub-Saharan Africa has no religious lights . And instead of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these very profound , in the tragic concepts of the tragic concepts of slavery .
What makes the interesting voodoo is the intense relationship between life and dead .
So , you know , the spirits .
The spirits can be invited by the Great Acqua , they respond to the dance of dance and replacing temporary , and they replace to the soul of the vive way that for a brief bad .
So , the voodooists are love to say , " You know , white white white you 're going to God .
We say in the temple and divention .
And from the moment you 're going to be driven that you , as can you do the bad ?
So you 're looking at these incredible events : following voodoo in state of trance that touch until units of the mind of the power when it 's cataled in a state of the mind when it 's catalyed in a state of extreme , when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme , exciting .
And in the popular populations that I lived the most extraordinary is the Kogi of Sierra Nevada de Sierra Marta Desector , in Colombia sectentry .
It 's about the ancient civilization that once they live on the caraibic planning of Colombic planning , the popular population , the popular population , the popular population that you erge on the piece of the piece .
In a blood continent in blood , this popular popular , this never been conquered by the spagering .
And then they have governed by a clero , but their formation is very extraordinary .
The young people are brought away from the families to three or four years , and they live secreged in a world that you have a good and shared world and shared in a world that 's made for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years of the gestation that they spend the nine months of gestation that they spent in the user of the mother , now are metaphor in the user of Great Mother .
So , so , they get acculturate to the values of their society , values that they predict and their predict and just their predict and they keep the cost of their cost , or to say the balance ecological .
At terminal , this incredible beginning , they 're improvisually taken out and for the first time in their life , at the age of the age of the first wrong , the age of the first cutters , when the sun background , when the sun background , everything that they learned theory is confermentioned in all of his splaces . The prete is confermed in all of his splending . The predict of the behind , the pattern of this incredible involved . . The prevous , the patterns . And then , the squared , and he says ,
" I 'm going to say , " " " " " " "
It 's amazing . Now , you 're protect it . "
They call the greater brothers and say that we , brothers , we are the colpatents of destruction .
This is intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the ingene populations and the environment , we think about the old noble story of the self-vace , which is a razy concept in its simplicity or perhaps , we say that these populations are close to the Earth of us .
The ingenious populations are not to be indebate , nor indebate .
There is no space for these things in the paluds of Aststop in the winds of the Tibet , but thank you , they created a mistic of the Earth , and they created a mistic of the Earth , but on a bad of the world , but on an intuition of a bad of the world , the concept that the Earth can only live in because it 's infection .
What do you mean ?
It 's going to say that a kid of Ande that growing the mountain is a spirit of the mountain Apu that will drils his destiny will be a different human destiny , and it 's going to have a different relationship with the mountain or that place in the Montana , and it 's a fun of a massive mass of Montana that a tiny of the Montana 's swaiting .
That 's the dimora of a spirit or a mineral crawling is irrighting .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the report between the natural and the natural world .
I grew up in the forest of the Columbia Britannica creding that the forest to be cut .
And what I made a different human being from my friends Kwakiutl that the forest is the forest of the Hukuk and the daf of paradise and the stories of paradise and the stories of the paradise and the dogs that live in the northern world , spirits that they 're in the early in the Hukills .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of them discoveries . We take this piece of them . We take this piece of plant .
I took this picture to open in the northern Amazon Nordoctor .
Maybe some of you heard about the ayahuasks , the most powerful such as a sciamanic repertory .
What makes the path is not the potential of the phyhuasks is , but his elaboration of the sustained . It 's composed to two elements .
From a hand , this leaving leaves that contains a series of betacarboline , harmine and harmind , slightly hallucinogenes .
Take the only plant is a blue that you have a blue that it 's a little bit of consciousness , but it 's mixed with the leaves of a family of the car caffee said Psychotridis .
This piece of triptamine , very similar powerful , similar to the serotonin the sypamine-five-tamine-t-amine-pamines .
If you ever see the Yanomami , you know , the sustainance that make a different set of species , ancher contains methoxypamine .
And then you 're going to be spared by a little bit like being spared by a smoke of a pink of pursuing debaros and landing up a demand land-scape . They don 't create a distortion of reality .
I would just give my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who waiting was psychedeliver , with his discovery of the fungi , with his discovery of the fungi in the 1930s in Mexico .
I think I 'm not a tending these trips like halluciny because if you 're not tells because if you 're not telling anybody of being told . And I said , " Look , " triployed to be , because money because they 're money from a such a mountain , detection as a tiny that 's intestine , detection of the inosency , it 's in the intestine , detection of course ,
It 's possible to be absolutely to other chemicals that money money in the MAO .
Now , it 's the beautiful : : Pocarboline , which is the same kind of MAO , the same kind of the same kind of need to be able to to tripamine tripamine . The question is , the source of the kind of 80,000 species of plants , how these populations are not , but that if you fight to fight , you know , if you combine in this way , they can create biochemical version that is superior of parts ?
We use the great eulife-proof the proof and error , which can be infrutting .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " The plants talk about it . "
What do you mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuash , which they 're under the forest , and that our eyes would be in the forest , and that our eyes would be in the same species .
If we ask them as they 're saying , they 'll tell them , " I thought about plants , " I thought I would know that ? " I thought . "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night of lone night , and each other , and each tone with a different tone .
And that 's not sleep to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that content stami .
Now , [ you open the problem is that even those of us who have heart people who have heart populations in the ingenes are pitting them , but somehow reduced to the margins of history in our real world , and it 's further than our real world , and it 's further .
In fact the 20th century , between 300 years , it will not be reminded for his wars or the innovations , but rather like the innovations , but rather like the early that we stopped and absolated activity of biological diversity of biological diversity and cultural diversity of biological diversity and cultural diversity of the planet . Now , the problem is not the change .
All culture through the seat have been involved in a dance for new life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians have no being toux , they didn 't stopped to be Sioux when they put out of Americans and fit as well as Americans have to be Americans when they put on the horse and and calculations .
It 's not the change or technology that they minaccount integrity . It 's the power .
The flight of domination .
And if you look at the world , you 'll find that these are not culture that these are cultures are not to be cultures .
They 're creating creatures and dynamics , the existence of identific forces that they go beyond their adaptation .
Which is that it 's disboxing in the patria of the Penan --
a popular no-axic popular , in the souest , a popular popular that has lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to the servitoften , and then you can see the inquinated by the rive , where you see the inquinated wild that looks like the Mar , where you see the involved of the Meridie , where the naves of the navi Meries , where the naves are slighten ,
and you can get the woooowners with the forest .
Or in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are coming with the discovery of the gold .
If we can move on the mountains of the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the flight of the political domination .
As the genocide , the physical extinction of a popular , is a universal , but the ethnocide , the destruction of the lifestyle of a popular popular , not only is condamn , but to add the strategy of the development , because it 's part of the development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet until you 're part of the Tibet until you 're part of the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in China , in China , in the Tibet , you get to Lhasa with a young colleague , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what we feel about .
6,000 sacred monuments to walk and further .
1.2 million people killed by the military Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical to Panchen Lama .
That means that it was killed to the time of Chinese invasion .
His the clear with Sua Santity during the diaspora that led popular popular in Nepal .
His mother was imprigioned and her color was to be rich .
It was brought to hide in two years old nose , the age of two years old nose , because it would not live without his gonna because it could not live without him .
The sister , which has done the same , was put in reeducation .
One day has been walked up a fashion Mao and , for this transgression , was put it in the forced for seven years .
The pain of Tibet can be inexportable , but the spirit of the popular popular is from popular .
And then you get a choice .
We want to live in the world 's world of the monocromatic or we want to get the policicromate world ?
The great anthropologiogue Margaret Mead , before he die was that , in our leaves to this vision advance vision of human imagination , not just see the whole gamm of human imagination of human imagination , we 'll be able to a mode , but one day we 'll be wake up from a sleeping , and we 'll wake up from a sleeping , even that they were able to dimented .
And it 's umillion of remember that our species is there for 60,000 years .
The Neolitical Revolution , which has gone to us agriculture , which made us to the cult of the seed cult of the seed cult , and we talk about the slandscape with the promises of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has 300 years .
That 's a story , not suggests that we have the answers that we have the answers that we should be able to deal in the millennia to come .
When these miriades of the world is asked what it means to be human , they say to be human , they say with 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all risk the possibility of being what we 're are : a conscious , which is to make everybody , which is to make everybody and the gardins can figure out . And there 's great ways of optimism . And there are great times .
I took this picture on the northrow the northern island of Baffin , when I went to hunt hunting with the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , and he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The canadical government has been always been centile to be able to be likely to stand in the 1950s to stand in our colonies .
The grandfather than that man refused to go .
The family , I told her life , took him all the arms , and all his cares .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't have the cold , they can 't .
Solden slexes in origin were made of cards .
The grandfather than this man didn 't intimise from the artics or the library of the library that was .
It 's gattacked out , it 's calculated the pantalone in the skin and defected in their hand . When the bad the hand . When I did the congelated , they worked by creating a lama .
He spred up on the top of this clue and when they became solide , it 's killed a dog .
He wasn 't the dog and created a brilliant , with the cash of the holized and blue another dog , and it 's disappeared on the banker , and it 's disappeared on the banker .
We want to talk about cavarsely with nothing ? [ Rism ] and that , in different ways , [ Applausi is the symbl of the Inuuuuit and all the people 's popular the world .
In the open , 1999 , the canading government sauce has given to the total area of a larger area of the greatest California and Texas the game together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's an independent territory . They control all the mineraries .
One splendidlendidlay can recognize with his popular .
And finally , I think it 's pretty obvious , at least at least who of us was in these remote zones of the planet , remote that they 're not remote .
For someone is home .
They represents of the human imagination that are treating at the high of the time . And for us all , the dreams of these kids , as the dreams of our kids , becomes part of the hope .
Finally , we have National Geographic we are convinced that politicians will never get to none .
We think the polemies --
[ Applauses ] isn 't persuasive , but we think that stories can change the world , and maybe the best institution to tell the world , maybe we 're the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month is 35 million living . Each our site . Every month is a website .
156 countries transmit our television .
Our remains are laughters from millions of people .
Our work is travel in the etnosphere to bring our audience in places of wonders that they will go away from how they 're going to the cleans and hopefult-hand-a-pology , will be able to get the central revealing of the world 's world , and we have to find a life in a pluralysicial world , and we have to find a life in a pluralistic world .
where the wisdom of all the popular can contribute to our well-being to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I written in this book that I hope you 've heard of it , and I 'm going to try to get some connections , in case , not nothing you 've heard .
I want to start with what I call " the dogma officer . "
The official dogma is ?
The dogma dogma 's dogma for all the Western dogma is floor of all the well-being of our citizens . " The way of doing it is massive . " The way of doing it is massive . "
The reason is , from a hand , in fact that freedom is in a value , it 's useful , useful , beings for humans .
The other is in the other is that if we 're free , each of us can act for all the way to do everything that massive our well-being , without any one that decided to our well-being , no one that decided to our name .
The way to massive freedom is massive choice .
The other choices , the more choices are free , and more than their well-being .
That , I think , it 's so deeply radicated in society that nobody would dream to put it in doubt .
And it 's also deeply radiced in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has been possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly great .
I 'm a simple note about conditions for switness .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without content 10 oil varieties of oil and the 12 acks of oil and the 12 acecuge , and the 12 acks of the huge of conditive , that nobody of the 175 of your degree already is to be your degree .
That 's what supermarket .
And then you go to the electronics store to buy a stereo stereo , radio , the CD , slector , radio , floor .
And in this single electronics , there 's a great number of components .
We can make six million and a half of different different different and a half of different different components that there are only in a store store .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
The camps : the world of communications .
As I once a child , you could get all get the desires of the phone phone , the phone that they were forned by mom Bell .
And they would be the phone , you wouldn 't buy it .
One consequence of that , in the other , was that the phone has never wrong .
These days went .
So , we have a variety of telephones , especially in the cell phones .
Here 's the mobile phones of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cut of the nose , and the bad to the bad burn .
If you don 't seen it in the store under the store , you 're going to be able to get .
And what 's happening is that people enters are in the stops and does this question . And you know what is the answer ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than bad bad bad , you true the same explosion of choices .
Axanitary , it doesn 't happen in the United States that you walk from doctor and the doctor and doctor , what you have to do .
Instead , you go from doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we might do A , or B , or " Those , you can do these benefits and these " Big benefits . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Dotte , what would I do ? "
And the doctor says , " As this benefits and these risks , and B has these benefits and these benefits .
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebad , " Dottore if she was me , what would do ? "
And the doctor , " But I 'm not she . "
The result of the result of the maless of the switch , expression that makes it look good .
But it 's not that a switch and responsibility to someone knows the doctor and the responsibility of someone knows -- and you know , the doctor , at any of course , it 's not in the ideal condition to take the patient .
There 's a huge marketing products , directly , directly to people like me and you , that if you think about it has no sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do it ?
The answer is that they want to doctor we call the doctor for asking to make it .
Something as the fundamental as is our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this vision , " We don 't want to force kids . We don 't want to be able to be a huge of identity : we need to invent identity : we need to invent identity .
And we can reinvent how many times we can make it .
That means that every morning , at the morning , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I spect to the family and marriage , a time time , a common time , until the perspective , it was that you can be the most soon as possible , and you start to make the most soon as possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when and , and not even what to do after .
And then , all of course , it 's really to play .
I teach students to very smart students , and I do the 20 percent of work than a time .
And not because they 're less slaughters , not because they 're floor .
but why are they involved , you know , " I should be saying , " What would I have to spoke or not ? I should be ? "
" What would I have to get to be later ? I have to think about before or the career ? "
I 'm interrogative .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this implment is not completely to get the tasks that asked and you don 't get a great vote to my exame .
And they have to do it . They 're very important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl , " technology allows us to work every day , every day , from every single day , from every single on the planet , transpls from Hotel Randoll .
And it 's a parently , and I 'm not going to tell anybody where , the WiFi works .
Not you say , because I want to use it .
What does this incredible freedom of choice we have about the work ? That 's that we have to decide , we have to go , and then at every moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son , and we can see our mobile phone in a tank , the Blackberry in the other , and the notetetetebook , and the notetetebook , and the notetetetetee .
And even if they 're all sorts of every minute that we see our son rovement , we 're also asking the game , we 're also asking this called ? "
" I have to say , " Do I have to get hables this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , all this makes the experience of your son of your son 's child , very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the things , big things , big , and the things of life , life is a choice .
As the world was this : Obad , there were some possibility , but it wasn 't all that choice .
The world today looks like this : The dilemma is , " Is it a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Shurt .
The positive slightly , so I 'm going to talk about the negative those negative ones .
And all of this choice , two effects of people .
The first one , paradoxally , is that it produces instead of liberation .
With a lot of choose options , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you an example , a study conducted on the floor of deployed floor of deployed .
A colleague had access to the data of the Vanoller data , the giant society of about a million clients of the funding , with about a million clients of employees .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adesion of two percent .
With 50 sources , there 's 10 percent of adesions in less than you 're only five to a five to address . Why ?
Because with 50 sources of them , which is sick is sick to decide , and choice is to decide , and choice is remained to the inmorrow .
And I 'm asking , and I still ask , questions , questions , and of course , and , of course , and I never get to .
You know that it doesn 't just mean that these workers are saying for these workers , because they 're not going to have enough money , it means that the decision is so ostics that they also lose the funding of complementary the source of the work .
Not to participating , they 're lost to five dollars from the dator of the work , which would be really disposed to be .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too much choices .
And I think it 's making the world .
" And finally , for eternity : ketchup , feels , or maionese ? "
You want to take the right decision , if it 's for ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the bottom , and yet the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoid paralysis , and we 're going to be under the end , we 're not satisfacts from the result of how we would be with less options .
And that for different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions of them , if you buy a and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you would have been able to make a different choice that would be better . And that 's what 's going on is the alternative imagined us industry , and the reduced by the south of the choice , and the reduced the south of the choice ,
And even when it was a very good decision .
The more choices are , the more is easy to be dispionem than any tremendous option of the option of choice .
And there is what economists call an expensive opportunity .
Dan Gilbert asked a lot of stamin as the value we 're going to the things that we 're in the depends on what we 're in frontiers .
And in the rest , when there are many options of the options that are telling the characteristics of the alternative characters , and be less unsatisfacts , and be less unsatisfacts .
Here is an example . I school with all the people who are not New York .
But that 's what you probably think .
There is this cople to Hamptons .
a place of luses .
It 's beavails . Oten days , it 's all for them .
Not nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , malth , it 's Agogods . "
" All my neighbors at Manhattan are away . "
" I could talk about front of home . "
And it 's two weeks , the possibility that 's losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The expensive opportunity is decrease for what we have , even when the choice was old .
And the more of the options we look at , the more the characteristics actors are going to be recognize as a constantly opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This vision tells us a lot of things .
It talks about the moment , and maybe the living slowly .
But the most important point is that any you choose , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you don 't do any other .
The things that we do .
Third point : it 's growing expectations .
I tried it on my skin beating a new jeans .
It 's almost always jeans .
And once the jeans were only one kind of a kind of , buy them and bad them were dissive , just after you bring them a life and jeans and jeans , they would go well .
So I went to buy a new when those old old old baded , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cuts . "
The commit said to me , " You want to slim , easy fit ? "
Do you want to the buttons or with the bottons ? " As " or " acacidwashed ?
" Do you want to be strong ? "
" Sotto them want to be longer , you know , " Be blaw , " he would be eleneneneneneneny .
I was switness , and after a little bit of the kind of said , " I want the kind of like , " I want the " " " I want the " " " I want the " " " " I want you to all the jeans , and then use out of jeans , and then I came out of the jeans , the best couple of jeans that I 've ever had .
It was the massive . And the whole choice , I had got the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice , with all that choice was very high , jeans had to be perfect .
I started waiting for me . I didn 't expect anything excited when it was a kind of a kind of a kind of , but when it 's a hundred different kind of 100 different , and at least a kind of a kind of a perfect .
What I was bad was good , but not perfect .
After I was compared that choose with what I was trying to introduce in the expectations .
The addition of the people in life does not increase that increasing expecting the expeccellence of the options .
And that will make less sell down , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the marketing world 's connected .
Because if you know , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth more like this .
" It was better when you were worse , " The reason it was better when you were worse , it was that when you were worse , it was that when he was worse , it was even even possible to meet .
The word , in the world that we live -- opulents , industrialized citizens with the expection of the perfefefefefefefefefefeature is that the altitude of expectations .
You never surprised to be surprised because your expectations , the myself is ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse , " Yes , " Yes , " You want to . "
I mean , small autobiography -- that I 'm really sposed and my wife is really stuided .
I wouldn 't have done better , I 'm not accounted .
But you get no always to be a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of the jeans that when there is just that kind of jeans is that when you 're not satisfacts , and you say , why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " The answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What could I do ?
When you get hundreds of jeans , and you buy a insurprising , and you ask , and you ask , you who is the responsible , it 's as clear that responsible for you .
You should have do better .
With hundreds of available , there are no floor of the insuccess .
So when people are they decisions , even if the result is , they feel involved , they feel insuit and they give the colcolor to them .
In the last years , the depression of the depression of the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- this wave is that the only one , but the depression of this wave is that people have the experiences because the standard is too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that color is they think that colcolpa is .
So the final result is that we 're better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remind you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not true .
There is no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than haven 't really affected , but it 's not a little choice .
There is a critical value , magical . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've taken by a piece of the level where the choices are better than our life .
Now , from political point , I 'm not almost finished -- from political point of view , the political nocce .
What allows you all this choice in industrial society is material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem isn 't that they have too choice .
The problem is that they 're too little .
So the face of the face that I 'm talking about is a disease of modern , recognize society .
And what he does to priming and is this : Steve Levitt talked about how much those expensive and discovers for biods are inuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuseful .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendious , it 's not just inuseful .
I 'm telling to them .
They make worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows would be taken in those people where they are too few possibilities , it would be not just their life to improve , but also , our life .
That is what economists call a pareting .
A redistribution of the redent is good at all -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice in excess that we come back .
And to conclude , " Fild , you can get everything you want ,
You , people are you going to think , " But what does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make anything in a glass . "
" Unlike , a limited imagination , a limited vision of the world , "
and that 's what I 've interpreted it , at the beginning .
But then , I realize that the long-term weight that fish knowledge .
Because the reality of fact is that if you manda in frantum the board , so that " all you can 't get the freedom . It 's gone . It 's gone .
If you break the bocks in a way that all can diminuliitous satisfaction .
You get the paralysis , and you 'll reduced the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too , maybe for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the assons of a few symbolic symbolic symbolic symbolic sphere is a recipe for the bad .
Thank you very much heart .
