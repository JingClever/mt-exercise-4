The year I 've showed these degrees to show that the calculate the glacial artics , which for almost three million years of the 48 million years of the United States , is reduced the United States , is records about 40 percent .
And that 's the gravity of the floor of the problem because I don 't show it the ice of the ice .
The calculate artics is , in a sense , the cuputting sense , the cupattern .
It 's saves and you get out of the extremely .
The next next to be a rapiece of carled by the last 25 years .
The ice ice have been driving in red .
And as you see , you can see the blue .
That 's the ice in the ice , which you can get extremely .
You can see that the cosidynamed , of five years or more , is like the sangue , which is like the sanguy , which is the body from the body .
In 25 years , it 's been in so ,
This is a problem because the interesse the interesse the whole thing that I 'm going around the ocean , where there 's huge of coal congeless , and they 're going to the microbes , they 're transformed in the metaps .
I 'm going to the totality of the inquination of the global scale , that quantity could be doubly , that you can 't refly .
In some laghi points in Alaska , the way the water is already rebolling from the water .
The professorespese Katey Walter in the U.A. Alaska team ,
Video : Wow Gore : You 're good . The question is if you 're going to be .
A reason is that this scale , the surrise from the North Groenland from the North .
This is a record to me .
And he had never reached .
This is the Kangerluslier , in the west of the Groenland .
If you want to know how the sal level of the wind to the favor , here is where it 's where you can add the mit .
These corrents are caumenting .
In the other part of the planet : Anttttttttartttttice of the planet .
The scientists have been asked that the scientists have been in the ice , and the Antttttarttttartttttttttttarttttttarly , it 's particularly in the scientists .
Eval level of the level of the active level .
Sull Himalaya , the most greater laghi , the most greater , which is a new laghi , which is , in the most years ago .
40 percent of the population is going to the water of the water water .
Sulle Ande : this ice is the source of water .
And the laded was aumented .
But when it diminues , the same access to water .
In California on the Nevada is the Nevada is about 40 percent .
The gets are recognize .
And the predictions , like you have a lecture .
The growth of the world 's world to a night of the car in the world .
The environmental environmental environmental and without precedents .
For times more number number of the last 30 years , I 've been 75 .
This is a handing of all instainable .
If you can see it in the context if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we 've got 70 million tonin the late of CO2 , 24 hours -- 25 million tons of the oceans every day .
Look at the area of the Pacific area , the American , and the object to the obvious , and both th the parts of the subjects , where there 's a poor or the oxygen imum in the ocean .
Most of the global remotion , together together , and the forest , which is 20 percent , is the 20 percent , is the ethal of comfortable .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the most emissions with the most emissions , together in China .
And it was provided to build a lot of carbon .
But we 're going to a change change .
These are the designers in the last years and some of the past years and some of the ververse .
And every way , there 's a politics in our country .
The carbon industry and oil have spected 250 million dollars in the last year for promote .
And I rerererereremember .
I was Natal , in the Tennesputs , where I was a 3.8 billion liters .
Maybe you 've seen it on the news .
This is the larger floor of scories in America .
It 's happened around Natal .
The public nature is a carbon industry of carbon was this .
Video : Where 's the coal , he 's a kind of a kind of burn and happy .
It 's abondant here in America , and we grow our economy .
Frosty the carbon is more .
It 's a good fun , adorable and the workers and the workers .
Al Gore : Da is part of the West Virginia .
The largest society on the mountain is Massey Compal . This is his love .
Video : Don Blankencount -- Al Gore , Nancy Peloften , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about what they 're talking about .
At the Gore : So the Alleance for the Clim has two campaise .
This is a part of it , a part .
Video : ALergy : ALergy see the climate change like a serious climate change .
So , our priority is investment to a big quantity of money in a high high advertic .
In fact , the carbon is not sport .
We 're going to be -- it 's also a good good good .
So , not predict of the change change .
Let me do we do .
Video : Actor : Carbon -- you have heard to talk about a very .
So , I do you have a gift in a structure of the head as a carbon .
I 'm a very much rump . The machines are a little bit of the technology .
We 're going to coal with the main the global cause of global warming , but the night of the technology that you see changed everything .
You have a lot of this is the technology of the technology of the coal diern .
At Gore : Find , the positive positive connetwork and the economic to the economic national and that 's national security .
Video : Coment : The America is in the crisis , the crisis .
The fallenge that the college of all : our dependence , like the coal , like the carbon , and the oil and the importance .
Now , I 'll be a new , audaily solution for use .
Repower , 100 percent energy , in the degree .
A piece to reput the America to work , it 's more , and help us more to stop the global recording .
Finally , a solution that basty solution to our problems .
Repower . Scoupt .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's the : It 's record to America .
One of the most faster than the dependence from the comfortable to the planet .
And what 's the future is here . I 'm here . It 's a new energy .
And so he 's going to be a few of hundreds of work .
Comment : Repower . It 's time to be realists .
At Gore : A tune proverbio says , " If you want to go to .
If you want to go back , you go together . "
We have to go back , fast .
Thank you very much .
They 're going to TED fection at TED fection .
And I promise to return to the nars on how the machine .
So , I have to get . And for the other time , there were no , the most experiment , the most experiment .
his compition is to recognition the conditions that were less than a billion from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times .
And all of this is just environment .
This is the Ginevra .
We 're picking these mini-Biang Biang Biang in the refuse .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLALATLATLATLALATLALATLALATLA.
This is an image of ATLATLATLATLATLATLALATLALATLALATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAATLALATLATLATLAS .
10 settember the year we have access the first car to the first time .
And this picture was the ATLALALATLALALATLALALALATLALALATLALATLATLALATLALALATLATLATLA.
It 's used to immense the festors in the saving .
It 's a picture of the first of the first of the LHC , and both in LHC , both , the daily , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles in the LHC , and spread particles .
In other words , when we see that the image of the 10 settember , we can understand that the machine .
I don 't know if it was this to exultremely to be a more or , when somebody was going on on Google and vide the beginning was this .
And what means we had a cultural impact in the scientific .
I was a week after , there was a problem with the machine , had to these kids here -- these kids here -- these kids .
These figure 13,000 amps when the machine is a massive of power .
Now , the technicians between you are going to you , " it 's not true .
And instead of it because when they 're very craft the cold codings .
So , at least 271 , at a temperature in the space between the space between the sts and the stars can bring that .
In one of the most of the most note of the most note in the LHC , there was a floor .
So the floor records and the 13,000 feet , and 13,000 feet 's improve a electrical eless .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think of these magnetnetwork , and that these magnetine more than 20 cents .
They 're dants about 50 magnetic .
We had to take them , what we 've done .
We repress and huge them and huge .
Now , they 're returing all of them to the place .
And he was the finger of the LHC will will be new integro .
We 're going to get , and we 're going to get to the right or light , and then we keep to the right now to discover what the universe are the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these clear way , these indebate the value of science and engineering the science and engineering .
I think the fact that the fact that it 's so hard to go through the limits , I think that 's the value of the things like LHC .
I want to conclude with the words in a scientist Inglan Ingleny Davy Davy , which , the way , the defesh , the indefesh , his own own , his or , his push , his own Michael Faradd , " Nichael Faradd , " Nichael Faradd , which is not our ideas ,
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to rethink when children , children , played , you play ,
And you can figure out how to reach them and free , and moving them , and moving them , learning to think and rethink about the problems and remainly remaininly relations .
The reason is provily connected to the way we understand part of the world around us .
So , from the atised inspired by our own own own own physics , together , and my connection , and my collaborator , and my collaborator Kalanthanii , I started asked up , and when we 're a computer , " And if we 're a computer , invent , you can have only have a crap of the car , which is to a physics on a phery , and I could have a physical information with a little bit of the way ,
and sistemaring our paciment ?
The question was so interesting that I decided to exploring the answer , building the Siftable .
In population , a Siftable computer is a big computer interactive computer as a bircost .
In population , a Siftable computer is a big computer interactive computer as a bircost .
He can move to the hand , can see the hand , you can see the the movement and have a perote and a rich and a radio .
But it 's objects , are objects , like the morning , you can move .
The Siftable of a new ecosystem for ecosystem for ecosystem to eat the digital .
And as the most physics , consciously , the other , and the more physics , and hand that becomes more physics , the other , as we can be a new movement , we can exploring new interaction and different interaction .
I 'll just just like a lot of example .
This Siftable is configured to show you in a direction , the video , the video of the way , the video , if you 're going to the other part of the back .
These are interactive active are consciously .
If you 're interested in what 's happening .
If they 're all all the data , and they can agitself a little bit .
If they 're all all the data , and they can agitself a little bit .
They have their movement and inclination .
We 've got the construction that one of the interaction was the power of the interaction was the power of the data , to example , " a color like a color like if it was a fun .
We have three Siftable configurated as seck of the truth and can use them to the color to the color in the central , where you can 't get .
I can use them to use them to the color in the central , where you put it .
If we 're too , we can put a little bit about it .
I 'm also beautiful possibility of appearing , like language and yet 's given , and yet the people can try and the things that fast , and you can see the result to the result to immediately .
Now , I 'm going to --
This is a sequence of Fibonacaahead of a program .
Here we have a words words that 's half between Scareer and Boggle .
Pratically , at every recognize a literally in every Siftable , Pratically , every Siftable , every Siftable to a house on every Siftable , and as you 're going to him on a die .
And then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new new new way of lectiny and new possibility to try to try to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came to the Media Lab , I did it and I did it and I did a video .
They 're like a very much .
And one of the things that kind of things is that you have to you have a lot of education .
I just say , " What 's words , " and they will be .
Here 's how to other people who have it .
This is our head more young , right there .
He wanted to only them .
They 're only morning , for him .
Now , this is a interaction of a interactive application .
We had to build a tool for the languages of the languages .
And he can be new characters in the wining , solving them .
And he can be new characters in the wining , solving them .
So , it 's doing the sole .
Video : The sole is .
David Merrill : Now , he 's a tractor in the wind .
Video : The tractor .
By job ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah !
So , I got the Siftable and put up up and put the character can interaction .
Video : Bau !
I inventing the story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It 's a story with the final story , and it can decide to him how you want .
DM : It 's a story with the final story , and it can decide to him how you want .
Video : Voon .
DM : The last example I 've got the time to show you is a tool , realized , to figure out of the music .
It 's a tool , recently , to figure and extreme to music .
The Siften here , they 're going to suons like became , and the battery .
On one of these four different variations , and you can choose what use .
And then then you can inserve these suons in a sequence from your paciment .
And also , the simply simply do a suit a " and a " " " and a sequence . "
These are actually control from the visual , like the reverbs and the filter .
The one of the hundreds of a particular and then including it .
And then there 's the general of the time and fly , which you applicate to the entire sequence .
We look like it .
Video : DM : So we 're going to put a base in two Siftable , " sequence , " systems in a series , we add to the other base .
Now , I 'm going to the line .
Video : DM : Now , I 'm going to the percussions --
Video : DM : And I was the filter in the battery , so I can control the effect .
Video : DM : Pocize the entire sequence to the entire sequence .
Video : DM : And I 'll go to the floor the floor .
Video : I can see the sequence " to the sequence " . "
So I don 't have to plan before , but I can improvate , it 's more more .
And now , I can squence the entire sequence to sequence the swinking to the Siftable . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is built to new interface , and more more sound like the more sound , how do it works like our brain and corbody .
And today , I 've been time to show you one of this experspent , and also some possibility that we 're going to bring out from the lab .
And the concept that I want to get this new generation of objects to interact with the media , which is going to interact with the digital media , which will take information in our world in the way that we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the now with all you .
I 'm a choice .
I 'm going to writing is my profession , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also the love and the fashion my life .
And I don 't expect me that can change .
But , I said , something about this was success in my life and my own own life and in my career , which has taken to recognize the entire recently recently .
The particular thing I have been recently screen this book , this biography called Manogy , Ame , Ame , the Ame , the different , I think of my book , for some reason , for some reason , and it 's a big , very sensitive , became a big , became a big , became a big ,
And the result is that everywhere , people are going to me as if I was condge like if they were condanted .
David -- condanned , condanned ,
They 're going to me to me all worry about me and say , " I don 't have to be better than you can 't do better ?
I don 't have to keep the writing out of life without more being able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can be able to somebody ? "
which can important somebody ? "
It 's rasy sure .
But it could go to the way , I recognize that more 20 years ago , when I started to say to the people -- I was a -- I wanted to be a screen -- I wanted to be a screen .
I was going to met the same reacted by the same reacted .
And people say , " I don 't have to be able to success ?
I don 't have a lot of the huge of the killed you ?
I don 't have to do this for all of life without the life without the life that nice is ever to die on a moving moving moving with the bottom of the clay with the bottom of the floor .
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : " Yeah . "
I was a pattern of all those things .
I 've always had been a purpy .
And I also have a lot of other things that people can 't have to inside .
How much and other things .
But , for how I was about the write what I was going to me , and I asked me , why ?
It 's rational ?
It 's a way that anybody has to be spected by a job that you 're going to do .
But what 's a particular way in the impress creative to realized that we can 't get to the save to the saving other carrier ,
How my father , for example , he was a cheeemist and not recognize a spoke of a himself in which was asked if it was asked if it was asked to be able to to be able to be able to to be able to to be able to to be able to to engineeeer ?
Don 't have -- that whether the engineer John , like ?
Don 't work , it 's going to be ?
Onestly , the engineers like group , they don 't have certainly , in the secos of being alcopy to be alcolized .
And then we have this reputation , we have this reputation , but creative of every gence , we have this reputation of being huge instainable to be huge indeed .
And I don 't have to look at the trils of the death of the magnifields , only in the 111th century , they 're dead and often , they 're dead to them .
And also the people that are not suicians to be recognize from their days .
Norman Miler , before I die , in the last last thing , " Ogn , I have been killed a little bit more " , a little bit more " I have been been a little bit about life .
But we don 't have to say , when we heard these things , we heard these things , we 've been completely interior that we 've completely interized and the notion that the creative and the notion of the way , and the notion is to be in some way , and the same , the end , in the way , you 're going to be .
And the question I want to bring all of the today is : you are in this idea with this idea ?
And he 's good at this thing -- because it 's just a centimer of a himself to me not good for anything .
I think it 's odiodiodiodd .
And I think it 's also , and I don 't want to see the next century in the next century .
I think it 's better incorporate our big creative creative to live .
And I 'm sure that , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to to start to the figure out of the supposition , but I 'm going to the circustances in which is my career .
And in the fact -- I 'm like , I 'm like , I 'm like , I 've about 40 years .
I still still have about four decades .
And it 's very likely that any thing I 'm going to be right now , where the work as the world as the work that was used to the spent of my last book .
I 'm going to schieve , because we 're all more friends here -- is likely that my greater success is to the mies to .
Oh , Gesus , who think , !
You know that it 's the kind of thinking that that you 're going to start to start to the nine of the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would like to keep this work that we 're going to do this work .
So , the question is , how ?
And so it looks after many reflection , which the way to work to keep it is to write the way to create a psychologic protected ,
I had some way to find a lot of sure of sure that I 'm going to be , and my natural , and my natural anxion which is about what I was going to get . And as I was trying to get it to the time on how I was looking at the time , I was trying to look at the time , and I can have to see other society and we can have the better ideas and have more more of the best ideas and more society .
And as you can help people believe the inerents of the inerents of the creative of the creativity .
And that research has been a Great the Great Rome .
I 'm going to go back and then back to the hit .
Nelil Great the Great Rome -- people don 't seem to believe that the creative of the men , OK ?
It was thought that the creativity was this spirit about the divine and that 's the men from a few people are distant to be squarter , for reasons .
The creativity of these divity of creativity , " demon the demon . "
Socrate , wonderful , created to have a demon the sagged that elart from the away .
The Romanaged were of the same idea , but they 're going to the body out a genium .
The great , which is really great , because the Romania didn 't really think that a genium was somebody particularly smart .
They have to be that a genium of indeed that a kind of inside that it was living in the bottom of the study of a study , a little bit like the elfo , and that 's going to be out of the work of the work , and that 's going to the work of the work of the work of the work .
And it 's a deal -- that 's the distance of which is the psychologic , which is the psychologic result that you protected from your work .
And everybody had had that was so that was so that was , right ?
So the artists were protts of things like for example , as for example , as a lot of several , no ?
If you can 't get the excitement of the way , you can 't take all of the time , everybody who had been helped by this genius .
If your work , your job , it was not all all the collives , right ?
And all of all of the tuges to be a hincapable .
And so people han , the people in Occident the creative of a long time .
And then the Riny came and all the changed and it , and I was going to be human , and we put the human being in the center of the universe and mists all the the time and mists that written to the death that written from the divinity .
This was the principle of human eximum and people started to think that the creativity was completely by the ishare .
And in the first time in the history , you know , it 's going to this or that the artist as a genius like a genius that one person with a person .
And I have to tell me , I think that was a big herror .
I think that allow somebody , a simple person to believe that you can do like a recipient , the essenenenency , the resources and the resources , creative inspired and a responsibility to a hundred responsibility to the psycholes to the psycholes .
It 's like to fire somebody to inguy the sole .
Deform and distores the ego and creates all of these ingestible expected on the performance .
And I think it was this pression to the artists in 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think that is the question , and now ?
We can do it fun ?
Maybe a more more than a more more than human relationship between human relationship between human relationship .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can 't square a 500 years of thinking about 18 minutes .
And there is people in the audience that solve would be law or scientific , insophysics on the notion of the nection , insoft that they 're going to people ,
And so I 'm not going to me to convince all this thing .
But the question I would like to take it is -- why no ?
Why don 't I think about this way ?
Because it 's more sense of any other thing that has ever heard to explain the exactly impreveability of the creative process .
And a process that , as anybody who has ever to do something -- so , all here -- you know , all here -- you know , you know , you don 't comporition .
And , in fact , it can it completely paranormal .
I did this met with the extraordinary poetetesis , which was 90 years , which has 90 years , but that was a poety for all life and said that it was a poety in the Virginy Virginy . And he was working in the fields , and he was in the field , and I was in the pocar .
I said that he was like a fraggery .
And he was rotoling to her from her from her car .
He was heard to get , because he was tremendous the land .
He had a solve thing to be to do that , he 's about , he 's like a map . "
And then he was going to go to the home and he was inseveral from this poety , and it would have to get a piece of card and a mathemath , as the traped , the traped , and the floor , and it was the page .
And so I couldn 't be enough enough , so correat , so correct and recorded without . "
And then there were those times -- this piece of the dementific -- there were the moments in which was almost almost almost allost ?
So , he was the home and he was trying to go to the card and the poeter was going through , and he was a mathemath , and then he said , and then he said , and then he said , and he said , that if you go to the other hand the way .
He was the population of the coffed by the body and the reput it in his body and the writing on the page .
And in these cases , the poor , the population , and the intention , but the last word at the first word at the first .
So when I feel that -- it 's going to be -- it 's exactly exactly the creative process .
And not all my process -- I 'm not a condition -- I don 't have a condstructure .
I 'm a music , and my way to work is ; it 's about it , and I 'll be .
But I even even in my head , I have a daggin , I met that thing ,
And I 'm also to be the han .
You know , even if the work and the ideas was drights to me from a certain cell .
And what is this thing ?
And how we can we relationship to it , but , I 'm going to do you don 't do it ?
So , how to me , the best example , the best example that I have the muista Tom Waititself , which I 've been different years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of the incarnation of the indeed contemporary contemporary contemporary contemporary creative , dominate these species of interactive creative interizes .
But then I was going to be , and a day , and a day , and a day , he was driving on a Los Angeles , changed .
And he was going to go and all of a little bit of a little framment of the eloil , which arrive in the inspired , how it does it , and the lander and the laptop , you know , it 's really wonderful , and the idention , but it was not like the .
He didn 't have a piece of card , not a mathemath , not a recording .
So I started to hear this species of a sweless to grow , " I 'm going to slexion , and I 'll smart from this canzone .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do . "
And instead of go to the wind , you 're going to go .
I 'm going to be the interest , and it 's something completely new .
I 'm going to just the cielse and said , " Scycle , I don 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" To you know a song .
If you really want to be , there 's a more opposite when I can take me .
Some , you 're going to do something today .
I 'm going to disturba Leonard Cohen . "
And his process changed after this .
I 'm not the work was not the work was always .
But the process , and the fish that was reaching the way , the geniiium , the geniium that was the genium of him that 's all the other problems and liberated the way to where it was inspired where it was to be a whole thing to be a whole thing and realized .
but he was this peculiar , wonderful bizars a conversation between Tom and this thing , and this thing was not Tom .
So how the story I was that story to change a little bit of the way I was working and I was already to me .
This idea , I was saving when I was writting " Manogy , Ame , Ame , " and the cave of the disperation where we 're working on something and we 're working on something and we 're working on something and we 're going to think about something , and we 're going to think about something that is going to be .
Not only bad , the worse , the worse .
And I started to think of gectacy this project .
But then I remember to Tom that 's talking to the air and I try to .
So , I was my face in the hands and I recognize and I recognize my hundreds of the room .
And I said , " Sents , " Sents , what you know if this book is not to be a brilliant , not interactly , not interactly .
Because as I see it , I 'm going to do everything I have , I don 't have more than this .
So if you want you to be better , and you can do your part .
OK . But if you don 't have it , you don 't know what I was not .
I 'll go to write the same because it 's my job .
And I want to do for favor that I was recorded to me my part of my part , " because -- I was so , OK , you know , in the desert of Africa in the North of the North , and music , and music to the cls of the dances and music and music and music who were going to the hours and the hours to the hours .
And they were always magnific , because the ballerge and were great .
But every every time , something happens , and one of these artists was actually transcendent actually transcendent .
And I know what you 're going to talk about , because I know , you know , a way , a way , a way .
It was as if you stop , and the ballery on a camminasse , and it was not doing anything about about the site , as a different kind of different , as the 1,000 you before , but it 's all the first , you 're all the time , but it 's all the time , it 's all the time , but it was .
And at the improvement of not just like a human human human .
But it 's happening from the dinity and under the divinity .
And when this is , you know , the people who had what was , the people who was called the name .
They were the hands and they started to cantate , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God . "
That 's God , you know .
And I mean , " More the More invest the More , the More the Spay , the Blah , the habitude with their hundreds of the " Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , " On , " On , " On , " On , " that you can 't hear in the famenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenens .
In Saian , when a tiny , when a magic , " Allah , " Allah , Allah , I was a good , " incompared , I was going to be , " I 'm going to recognize .
And it 's great because we need .
But the problem was the day , the day , for the same , when you see the same , when you see and I discopy and the copy of Martedrive and the scum of Marteteam and I don 't have .
It 's just a mortal mortal with gineye , and maybe not going to be more to asking that altness .
And maybe no one of the Doo , the name of God still as , and what do is to do with his life ?
It 's hard to hard .
This is one of the most horest recognition to a life creative life .
But maybe it 's not to be so much if you can 't believe , if you can 't believe , the most extraordinary , which is the most extraordinary of your own .
But they 're just that you 're going to be data in the prestable to a squisdom of this squisly of your life that you have to the other when you have .
And , you know , if we think about this .
And so I started thinking , and it 's sure , and it 's sure as I thought I was thought for different months of the book that I was going to do , the time , the time I 'm going to do , the time , the time I was going to follow my own own own own own own own success .
And what I have to keep me when I feel else me when I feel else to this is , not have a couple .
I don 't go to . It 's just your job .
I think of it to be .
If your work is bally , bally .
If the draw , I asked you to leave me some kind of wake , for a little bit of all , for only only only only only only through your site , then you can force , " Os . "
And I have the same your dance .
" Ole ! "
I think I 'm going to teach it .
" Os ! "
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : OK !
As you know , you know about some of these projects on the genome , what can meaning and the discover new genes .
Now we 're starting a new way , we started to digitalize biology and now , and now now , and now , we 're going to the building in a new fashion a new fasking in a new fasking .
We 've always been trying to take big questions .
" What is life ? " What 's a lot of biologs I think they 're going to figure out .
We 've tried to be a different approach , you reduced in the terms .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we have a genome the genome of the human world 's going to the world from the world of biology in the world .
Now , we can see the life , or create new life , or create new life from this universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the most little little bit of the little more than the little little little little bit of the little little bit of the laboratory .
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome for a little more little bit more little .
We 're able to eliminate a century of genes about 500 that 's here .
But when we see a hundred metabolic , it 's relatively to our .
I mean , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one to the time , it 's very improbrought to a living cells .
So we decided that the only only to protected to protected this cromosom to be able to a way to modify components to the some of these questions .
And so we started the the " Posare sintetizing a cromosoma ? "
And I 'll be the chemices to protected these big molecule that we have never done before ?
And in case , in case , we can work a cromosom ?
a cromosom is just a piece of cromoment .
The fast with we 're able to digitalize life is going to grow the exponential life is going to exponential .
our ability to write the genetic code , instead , instead , but it 's better .
And our more recent result on a curve exponential curve on a curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process has a lot of the past of the past , we started with a biothics before we started .
But we found that that DNA is very hard .
There are a thousands of thousands of the world that producing little segment of DNA , the lecting of 30 to 50 lectiny and it 's a lot of the segment is a longer , more herrors .
So we had to develop a new metodo for a new metodo , and reach these herrors .
And this was our first tentative first , in particular , in the digital of the genome of Phi 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills .
We designed the framments , effectured the corretion of the herrors and get a molecule of about 5,000 lectiny .
The part is the interesting part is when we 've got this piece of chemical material and we 've been inside in the battern , the battern , the battern , and to protected this code and produced in the viral particles .
The particles are record from the cells , they 're back back to the cell , and they 're back and they distrutter .
I 've been talking about the recent with the cemiles of the oil that they have certainly compress that they have certainly compress .
They have more than you .
We can actually build the situation in which the software can actually build the same immediate in a biological biological system .
But we wanted to do the more in the larger .
We had to build the intercccromosom of the battern .
I 'm more than 5800s of the genetic code .
So we 've thought about a few of the virus of the virus of virus , so that we could change the beautiful of the living .
The designing is crucial designers , and if we start with information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we could sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accuratury was a herror for every 10 mile .
We found , we found it , 30 percent , 30 errors , 30 errors that sequence .
One part of the process is designing segment to the 50 lectiny that you can sovement with all other segments of 50 lectable to build more little bit more little bit more little bit more little bit than they 're working together .
We have to be a only elements here .
You have a burn that we 've got a lot of floor .
Think about this : we have a genetic code on four lectiny , and Ten .
And there 's some of those lectiny together about 20 friendly , and there 's a specific recently , and there 's a specific way to hold .
So we can use the genetic code to writing , almost , almost , you think .
What we did in the beginning was the beginning .
Some were in the fact that it was not in the fact that it was not poety .
We designed these segments for these segments for just to be a way with me .
There 's a reparan ints and put them them them and put them .
And we started to assemble to the parts , began with segment , and we started with seven to a seven to the segment to form segment to the segment of 24 mile .
And we have these sequening these sequening in a squening sequening to the sequening to to create a process of creating process .
We 're trying to automatizing the process .
So , this seems to the tabellon a player of a basket .
When we 're going to be much much more than 100 mile , more than 100 mile , not grow up .
It 's all the limb of the modern of biology .
So we 've been a other mectively .
We had a other mecurified mechanism called refields to the DNA , which is used to reparate the DNA in the way .
Here 's a example .
This organism , called Deinococcus , it can assumption , it can assumption .
You can see in the requarter as his cromoster .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembly like before .
They 're thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can sex .
I can live under the vaces .
I 'm absolutely , that life in space , and you can find new new environments to find new environments .
And in the NASA has showed that this is .
This is a molecule of the molecule that we built these processes , just use the properties with design .
The floor assemble ,
This picture was not scaped with a microscope with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a lot of a big big that we can see with a microscope with a microscope .
These are picture that I have a period of about six seconds .
This is the published that we did .
I 'm more than 580,000 lectiny of the genetic .
It 's the most large of a larger structure of a man .
He 's a lot of a molecular fish .
If we 're going to be with a 10 without spaces , you would like 142 page for only to translate this code .
Now , how do we do it ? How do we do it ?
Of course , a virus is a virus of boys .
It 's a little bit more complicated when you use the batterns .
It 's more simple when it 's the cell cell . And it 's just as our : you can just be a nucleo and inserve it to a other , which is process of clonation .
In the battern the cromosome is instead in the cell , but we have recently showed that we 're able to do a transpent to do a trick cromoon a cromoment of a cell .
We can have a cromoment from a microbial species .
The two different are as the two are from the tops .
We 've got a lot of gene in the more way to decide what I wake to this cromosome .
And then the scientists to the way to kill all the protected to kill all the protected .
And when we have a cell is a cell was study -- and apprecious , you 're going to our graphy -- the new cell .
And we were we were we could not going to go to the way , but we 've been going to spaces us more in .
This is one of the most of the evolution of evolution .
We found that we found that a lot of a second or a third or a hole of a second , in a second , in a second new new new trats of new trats .
So who think about the evolution as a gene in the evolution that you 're not going to understand part of biology .
They 're all of the restriition of restriition to restriition to the digit digery .
The cromosome that was in the cells .
The cell phula-cell phone that we have inserit----cell .
It 's expressed the other cromosom as material , and it 's recognize , and we 're records with only , and we 're returned with only the new cell .
it was became blue because of the genes we have inserious .
And in a short time , all the carracteristic kind of a kind of a kind of a new species , and it 's transformed in a new species , based on the new software that we inside in the cells .
And all of the protected , the memeeting , and when we 're changing the genetic code , and when we 're going to the genetic exactly what we 've been done .
Now , this could seemal genetic , but alterm the software , but alterm the software enough enough enough .
Now , I 've been explained that here 's not talking about genespecies -- but I have I told to the three million years and evolution , and I 've said that maybe to create a new version of the Cambrian exacsion of the Cambrian that will be new species on this process .
Why do it ?
I think it 's enough of course , when we think about our necessity .
We 're going to go to six billion people in the next 40 years ,
Just to give example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there 's three people on the planet for obnice in 1946 , 40 years , there 's four .
We 're going to find problems now in the water , water and reaching , and recently , medicinal and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more to do it for nove billion .
We 're more than five billion , more than 30 billion , more than 30 billion baries .
And what means is cut a day .
When we 're looking at biological processes , or any kind of process to rempizars , it will be a huge .
We have to have more to have all the emidddle of CO2 from these materials that finished in the atmosphere .
At day , because of the scientific discovered in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are components for the future .
The industry is a dozenin the middle of components , and think about how many different things are .
Our limits here are the principlly of biological and our imagation .
Now , we have a techniques , because these metods of a sintetization , in fact , we call genomics .
We 're able to build a big robot robots that can produce a million cromosome .
Think about processing these 20 million genes or a lot of homes or to be a lot of homes , and they can change or a little , new crugs , new cut , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a selection selection .
We can choose to be able to survive for the such , production or carbon , production , production of vaccines .
This is an ancient instantly some software in that we 're working for being able to be able to be able to sector and designing .
Well , we don 't know how they will be .
We know , exactly the genetic is their genetic .
Now we 're concentrating supply of how to generation .
You 've seen you have that you can see that the thanol was a wind experiment .
We have carbon second and third of the generation that are going to be free to the floor of more allows as the of-value gets or different kinds of butanable .
But the only way the only way the biology can have a big impact without a big car to the food and limitate the disponity would be transformed to the disponing the disponing that we 're working for designing for designing that we 're working for designing to design the cell that we 're going to be in the most of the world , and we can have to be about 18 months .
The light solar solar field with CO2 is a metodom -- but in our world , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we 've been in 1996 .
He 's going to the ocean , about 2500 feet of profound about 2500 feet of the water .
They 're put out of the CO2 , we 're going to idrocket a molecular energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can incannot incannot to be translated to be transformed to be transvertic , convertic that CO2 in carbon , to drive this process .
So , we could be able to be able to car what the question of the question of what is is the life of the " that is life is the " is Not . We have the modness of the entire industria goal industriy of oil industriy .
Exist . If you can 't do it from TED , where you can 't do it ?
It would be a main the main energy .
And we 're working for the same way to use the same way to make vaccines .
You 've seen this year with the influence , we 're always back to a year and a year when you 're going to find the right .
I think what you can change in the ants of the combines in an ancient des .
And that 's how the future could start to change , now , the world 's evolution , accerating the evolution of evolution with batterns , and inside the battern , and inside the cell .
We 're just to be so from the best people .
Our is to do it in a way to live enough to be able to to be . Thank you very much .
And I 'll show you , the most possible , the most possible , some of the new technology that we 've taken to the Microsoft in the following in the following a year ago .
It 's a kind of an environment that you can interact is about the local level that you can interact with a visual visual data .
And here we 're seeing a lot of photos with a digital species with a kind of zoom , for a fast and continuous fast , to a fast , disponing the image like .
And it 's not how big the amount of information that information that we see , how much these things are great , or the images or the images .
Most of the photographs are digital photographs , but this for example is a provide from the Biiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiist .
It 's not a difference because the only thing that you 're going to the prestations of a system like this is the number of like this is the number of the time . It 's also a very architecture .
This is a book , this is a book , you don 't have images .
This is the Casa Dickens . Ogn . Oggams .
And so I shows you that it 's just about the rest and not to see a thing about the kind of the genious repress that is a represent represent of the rest , not a picture .
It could be a little bit neighborhood to read a book .
I don 't have to be .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the Look .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And it 's really the floor the beautiful experience of the version of the version of a version or a quoid or a quoid or a lot of nature .
We also did something with the angle of this number of the Look at the Wordian .
We 've created a fasull resolutionary fashion -- much more more than that you use a normal advertic advertic -- and we 've inserious about the conscious .
If you want to see the career of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even specific phends .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We 're going to be able to be able to the end , and other downers and other downers , not have to be necessary .
Naturally , the mapplications is one of the most obvious of the most of technology .
And on this camp , if I don 't want to say that we have to say that we have to give you a field .
These are all the structure in the U.S.
So we 're going to whether it 's something else .
This is now , that 's the view of the West -- you can go to .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a research for Noah Snaveling , a student of the University , a student of the Washington , with the Seitz Seitz , with the U.S. . .
And it 's from the Westion , the Westion .
You can see it when we do this kind of pattern , where we can spent from a picture to another and have this kind of expensive solution .
But the colliation of the picture here has a meaning meaning .
And the algorites of the computer have the computer recorded these images together , in the way that correspondings , in which the images that the images -- all the time -- all the time -- all the time -- all the sorts of the Rocal Rocten , they 're going to the saddress .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more spaces .
I want to go to one of the data of the original data , and this is from a precedent prototype of Photosynth , we 've done for the first time that we 've done to show you what it is really the first time to show you what is really the clear to show you what is the next technology is the clear . And it 's not necessary . And it 's not necessary .
We had to worry about the expected of the expected and saying .
This is a rebuild of the Let 's rebuild Decame . And I was a digitate rebuild Notice . Bast 's digitate Din Flickr and you get images of the fields , other fields in magazine , other fields .
So , I 'm all images from Flickr and they were all lights to the spaces in this way .
And it 's possible to be able to a way .
You know , I would never have thought about the end to work for Microsoft .
It 's very fairly recognience here .
I think you see that that you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of different cell : those of those phones of those phones of the phone , SLR , a number of meaning , a number of meaning , a number of meaning ,
And if you get to try to try to try to try to try to look at those more strange .
Many are are block , etc .
And there 's some part here is a series of photographs -- I have a series of photographs .
This is a Notre Dame Dame .
We can go to the moment of the vist of this environment .
The point is that we can do things with the social environment . This is now now now , from the intermemory , from the intermemory , from the entire dress , from the visual point of vist , and you all the other data .
All of the picture are all college together , most of the parts of the parts .
You have a model of the interest that emerge .
Think about this as a job of the work of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity that people use , and the people use it , and the the hyet to the aughter .
And their pictures are marced with other people .
If somebody 's the idea of the idea of all these saying all these saying , my picture of the Nototice Dotototice Darrich , you can get all of all the data , and can use how to do you get to the result to the resources to the resrespect in the space , in the universe , and you can use the photos of the cell .
And in the consequence of all of all of this is the virtual model of every part of every part of the terms of the term , and you 're not just to be able to be able and images , but from the memory .
Thank you very much .
Who Anderson : I realized it ? What your software going to do is that ?
By : Yeah . What 's doing is the way .
It 's creating the hyperlines , if you want , you want to the picture .
And it 's doing it in the content of the images .
The thing is very interesting , if you think about the recognize of information that many of these images of these images .
And as you do a research on the web , you can digit a fast and the page on the web has a lot of information about the picture of the picture .
Now , what happens if that picture is the picture of your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection and the quantity and the quantity of recognize that is really huge .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible .
By : Vrinational .
One of the main the main when you travel and one of the research of the research is the power of the points between who have not dimented the anti--traditions , between who have the past in the past , the wind to the ploycle , the traditions , the floor in the fairly , the floor of the floor .
And the scientists Jaguar travel , or the Via Lattea , or that the mites of the Inuit 's still still colors , or that the Himalaybe , or that the floor , the good thing that the Dema , to recognance of the most important way to recognance , and the most important thing that the idea that the world , and it 's not only exists to sense of the most of the most of the solutting , but it is a sense of the most of the world ,
The consequence of a particular scelds that our stropy has done , well , or a lot of generations .
And of course , we all shares the trats of the trats .
We 're all . We have .
We 're going to be the respts .
We have to furate the inesorability of dead , so we don 't take it and ballifts and .
We all have a art .
And what it is the particular thing is the particular of canzone , the run of every culture .
It 's not the inforests of the Borneo , or the following of Haiti , or Haiti , or the wind of Haiti , or the windoor Kenya , Candmall , or a wake of the Anysa , or a wake in .
He was my company in the desert of the wind in the desert , or a high of the cyak in the Everest , the Everest , the Everest , the mother of the world .
All of these places us that there are other ways of us to exists that there are other ways of the mods of moving in the world .
And if you reflected a active concept that you can give you hope .
And in the world , the measure of cultures of cultures of life can explain the spiritual and cultural cultures that 's important to be the planet and cultures as the planet and it 's important as the ragela nothing like biosphere .
And you can think about this ragela cultural etnossmothththnossmom and can definition the soft sommmed , the sound of all the conceptions , inspired , ideas , intuitions , inspired , intuition from the human beings of the human consciousness .
The etnosfetime is the patrimonium of human .
It 's the symbols of what we can be in how to be as a kind of initive .
And it 's just a biosphere was a very much as well is success to the thnossmom and purched much more rapidly .
Nooogist , for example , which 50 percent of all species was about the orld of all species , because it 's just a lot of the most of the most of the most of biological -- in the most of biological biological -- and you can 't have more more than the poor of the most of the most of the most of the most of the cultural cultural cultural .
The insays , the ints of all of this is , of languistic .
When you 're nated 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not only only from a vocabolary or a series of rules .
One language is the midddle of human spirit .
It 's the half of the animal which animal in the world .
Every language is a high of mind , a hind , a depensive ecosystem .
And the those 6,000 language , as we 're sedutting to Monterey , it 's not more susuddenly .
They 're not more teaching children , the kids , the less than not won 't sleast , which is already die .
What 's more tried to be fly from the silence , the last thing about a lends to talk about a language , not to have the sagges or the telling of the expensive to the puring of the floor of the promise ?
This is a few weeks in some part of somebody in some of every two weeks , every two weeks , and a moment and a moment and door and the door in the tomber .
And I know somebody who will tell you , " it 's not so ?
The world would not be a better place if we 're going to save all the same language , then we talk about it . We 're going to all about .
We 're going to go to .
You 're going to say that you can 't say about the language .
And I would like to do a journey through the etnosfera .
a little journey in the etnosfy for a little bit of what we 're alking .
Many of us dimented that when I say , " different ways of exists , " intentist .
We can take for example of this bimber Barasin Amazony , the popular of the anacy , which creates to the wait from the fest fests of the fest in the latest of the gaps .
It 's a popular popull that is not able to be able to the color the blue , because the moment of the forest , which is identified in the time , which depends the popular .
They have a strange language and a mathematriririmonial , " " " " I can have a different person who 's defun .
And all of this has radical in the past , but the particularity is that in these families is that in these families in which is about six or six or six to six .
They 're all all the argue and then they start to talk about .
We can see one of the most interests with the most interests with which I lived , the Waorani , a popular populum that has been the first conscious , a popull that he had the first concontain in 1958 .
In 1957 five five missionary have been a contained inside a herror .
They did it from the photographs that they were raise in pose pose that they were friendly , dimented that this popull of the pluvial foresting .
They had been told to the picture of the research , they were driving a free and , not find out there , they 're not found out of the diaveled , and they killed the five missionary .
But Waorans don 't only kills the laniesterday .
They have been killed to them .
The 54 percent of the mortality was caused by them .
We 're going to be a generations and we found two of mors , and we found two of mors , and when we 've got to know , they have a lot of them was invent that one of them was invent , and then they had the same time , and then they had the same way .
The clacers were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the first years , I was was asked a very interesting company when my professor , I was really interesting when I was asked to Harvard to Harvard to Haiti to the secret between the power of the power of the power of Duvice and the Macoes of the power of Duvard and the Macoe and make the stats of the phomens and make the zooms and make the stopened to to to do .
So I would have to take a sense of a mile , I would have to understand the culture Vodoor and Vodoor is not .
It 's a further than a complex metaphy , and the world .
Many interesting .
If you ask you to tell me the big religion , what you do ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always always out , thinking that Africa is not about Africa , and the Vodoor , and the Vodoor is not the other thing that the wouldn 't have to be very projects of these religious religious expensive to be very projects in the waiting the tragic tragic .
And what makes the interesting voodoor is the voodoor is the death of life and death .
So , you 're going to get the spirits .
And they can be invest from the Great Acqua , the respect of the dance and they recently reached the aneously , and they recently restained the way that for a shape .
So , the voodoodoothers , " You can go to to the Doodom .
We 're in the temple and divention and divention . "
And from the time you can sedutes , it 's the spirit that you can do you do you do you do you do you do ?
So you have these incredible incredible , following the voodoor in the state of the tranks that touched a degreation depiece of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power of the power .
And there was all the popull that I lived the most extraordinary of the Nevada 's Kogi , in Santa , in the Nevada , in Colombirth .
The ancivilization of the civilization that a living on the planets in the planets in the midddle of the conquire in the conquickly , the population of the player that you 're on the player of the plan .
In a continent , he was sangued to sanguy , this popull was never conquared to the spaces .
And so , in the government today , but their formation is actually extraordinary extraordinary .
The young gers came from the families to the families , and live secreated in a world , and live in a world world made of good world and blood in the world .
Two danger of the noves of the nine of the nine of the nine , which is the nine of the gestation that translate in the mother of the Great MMMMMMMMMMMfather .
So , in this time , they 're accultural values of their society , values that their predict and only their predict to their predict , or the equilifestimate .
Atermine of this incredible beginning , they 're improvate out and for the first time in their life , in their life , in 18 years , and they see a high . And in that the moving of the first cut , when the slightly the first cut , when the slightly , all of the most beautiful value , all of the time , it 's going to the favored . And in the past .
" Did ? Did ? I said .
It 's study . Now , you know .
They 're called the most of the most of the destruction and they say that we 're the colors of the destruction of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think about the populations and the environment and the environment , and the old history of the noble became in the noble became simplicity in its simplicity or maybe we 're going to be in the simplicity or the most of the Earth .
The popull are not not nitself is not nitself is indebolites from the nostalogy .
There 's no space for these things in the palures of the disease in the war or in the war , but thank you , because of the time and I realized , they 've created a mistics of the Earth , they created with the conception of the power , but you can be construction about the most of the most such .
What does it mean ?
I mean , a guide of Ande in Ande , which is a very different spirit Apu that the Apu , that 's going to be a human destine . It will be a different proport .
which is the demouse is the dimit or a mineral cemile is irrights .
And what 's interesting is the metaphor the physics between the individual and the natural world .
I was grown in the forest in the forests of Britannic Britannic , and they need to be wrong .

If you start to look at that these cultures can actually make a lot of different discovered to to understand some of their discovered .

If you 're going to see the Yanomi on for the nass that they do from a different kind of a different species , anched conscious species , and it conscious methoxypamine .
Tirate that pollution is a little bit like being a little bit like being spared by a fire career .
I was spected with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wait was psychethic , with her discovered by the 1930 , in the ' 30 years in the ' 30 years in the ' 30 years .
I 'm going to be a classified to classify these tripes like you can 't tell you , because if you 're not done to tell any of no one of you can 't tell any of being hallucinated .
It 's possible to be just if you just like , if you 're going to other summmer , MAOOOOf .

We 're the big eufy of the prove and the herror , which can revehiced .
But if we ask to the Indians , " The plant , " The piece of the people who are talking about . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , the Cofan , which is 17 variety in the forests , and that we 're going to our eyes in the same species .
If you ask the way , you know , they 're going to them to say , " I thought , " I was going to figure out , the rest of the rest , " " No . "
The solution is : you 're going to 17 varietety in a night of a slens and a lot of different square .
I don 't have to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that connecting the stami .
Now , [ [ [ ] ] the problem is that the people who have heart heart the popull , but in a few people who have pitting pitting you to the the story of the story of the story of the story of the story , and it 's expensive .
In fact the 20th century , between 300 years , not will not remember for its cheery or innovations , but it 's actually like the we 're stmitting and we 're stmed and we 're stmitting and we have a lot of the massive biological massive struction of biological biological world . Now , the world 's not the world .
All cultures in the secoal secoal in a dance for new life .
And the problem is not the technology .
The Indians Sioux didn 't have to be Sioux when they 're going to be . And that 's where Americans have no no men , they didn 't have to be American when they were not to be .
It 's not the technology that the technology that mine integrity of the etnossfera .
The domination of the domination .
And if you 're looking at the world , discover that these are not cultures that these are not cultures ,
They 're creatures and dinner out of the identific existence from forces that will be able to their adapapapment .
And I think that tratric of the indeed in the patria --
a popull Sarawak , in the sud-asiat-asiat-a-a-a-h-hundred population in the forestimate , and now now , and now redownnnice , where you can see the floor , where you can see the floor the fourth of the Borneighborhood , where we 're going to be the Minese Minese Minese , where the Minese Cornavels , where the Minese Cort , where you can see the Cort the Cort ,
You can get the standing the swood with the lander .
Or , in the case of the Yanomi , are the disease that are coming with the gold .
If we 're on the mountain the world of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research of the politics .
How you know the genocide , the extinction of a popull of a popull , but the etnodio , the etnodio , but the destruction of a populle of life , but the destruction of a popular population , but it 's not only connected , but part of the development , because of the ategy of the development .
And you can 't understand the soffering the Tibet .
I 've lost the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in Chinside the Tibet , the Tibet , came to Lhasa soubed young , but only came to Lhasa , but only came to Lhasa , I 've got to talk about .
6,000 monuments sacridots in the pollen and cense .

The Tibet can be ininsoon can be ininside , but it 's the inside of the popular is from hold .
And in the end , all of it , all the way .
We want to live in the world world 's world of the world 's monootony or the world 's the pollen of the different world ?

This is any story not suggests that we have the answers that we have to all the sfies that we 're going to be able to .
When these miriririririririaxed what you want to say to be human , to say ,
And it 's in these risis that we all record the possibility of being what we are : a kind of consciously , which is to make all the population and all the people can be . And there 's great . And there 's great .
I was scaped this picture on the northrow of the Baffin , when I went to the Baffin , when I went to the Inuit , and this man , Olaya story , Olaya story .
The government cannot been been not always the country with the People in the ' 50s , and in the 1950s , we have run in the 1950 , we have run in colonies .

We want to talk about the cavared with nothing ? [ [ [ [ [ Aplauses .
In the 1999 , the government of the England has reached the Inuit in the total area of the most larger of the California and Texas the Texas the California and Texmed together .
It 's their new patria patria .
It 's a third dependent . We 've got all the resources .
One splends like a national national national could recognize with his popull .
And , to finished , I think it 's obvious , at least who was in these zremote of the planet , remote that they 're not fly .
For somebody is home .
They repress the human imagination that risales to the high of the time . And for us all of these kids , like the sogams of our kids , and the kids , becomes part of our children , becomes part of the hope .
For finally , we have to the Geographic we 've been convince that politicians will never be a nice .
We think the polemiics --
[ Aplauses don 't lost , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we can change the best institution to tell the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Ogams our month .

Our work is traving in the etnossmoke to bring our audience in light , which is going to be able to the cut that they will be seen and hope , you can hope , habove the time for the central revely of the world : the world 's time to be in the world : the world 's going to be in the world , and we have to find a lifetist in a world .
which is the saggeness of all populse can be constructed to our blue .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I 've been going to the other things that I hope you have heard and I 'm going to get some collements , in the case not the nothing .
I want to start with what I call the dogma , "
The dogen to the sufficial thing ?
The dogen from all society of all society , the dogen citizens : " If we want to massive to be the citizens " " The citizens " " The way to do is massive to do it is a massive individual . "
The reason , from a late , in the fact that the liberty is in the same value , is previce for human human beings .
In the other is in the fact that if we are lights , each of us can act for all of us to do everything that , without no one that you can be , without nobody who decided in nobody .
The way to massive liberation is massive to the sceless .
And the other people have , more liberation , more liberation , and most of them is their liberty , most of them is their own .
This is so , it 's so much foundly in society that no one is to be a foundly .
And it 's also proached in our lives .
I 'll show you some examples of what the resrespect .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly great .
I could actually have a simple condments for injumped .
In my supermarket , there 's 175 condments , without a 10 variety of extractly the 12 acetc .
Here 's the supermarket .
And then you went to the negotic to buy a stereo , you know , you know , the CD , you know , the CD , the Bray , the left .
And in this single negotic electrony , there 's a big number of components .
We can realize six million different combinations that we can use the components that there are only a negotic .
Biiisoon that there is a lot of choice .
Altri campes : the world 's the world .
And once , when I was a child , they could get all the telephone , to desire , to path , to packs that were forned from the mom .
He was a telephone , he didn 't know it .
One consequence of the other , between the other , was that the phone was that the phone .
These are time .
We have a variety of phone , in phphone , specially between phone .
Here 's the phone of the future .
My favorite is the middle , the MP3 , the MP3 , and forward for the crowd for the crow .
If you don 't have seen in the home , you 're going to look at the home that you 're going to be .
And what happens is that people in the negozes in the negozes and it 's the answer is . "
It 's not possible to comprate a cell that you don 't do it .
So in other things that are much more important of the lifts , you know , the same extremendous extremendous .
Assistening , " Don 't the United States that you 're going to the United States that you have to do .
I mean , you can go from the doctor , and the doctor says , " Okay , " Okay , " A " A " A " A " A " You can do it . " And these guys , " " You want to do ? "
You know , " Dottore , " Dottore , what I should do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these became , and these guys and these guys and these guys and these risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you can be , " Dottore , " Dran if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I don 't have . "
The result to the result of the disease , " autonomous , which is it seemed a beautiful thing .
But actually is not a spot and the responsibility and responsibility to somebody who 's something , others , oxis the way , to quals that you don 't know anything -- and so much of it -- and so much of it is not not in the condition to decisions .
There 's a huge marketing products , the drugs , direct to people like me and you know , you know , you know , you can 't compared them .
But if we can 't comprate them , because it 's the audience ?
The answer is that they want to the doctor to ask the doctor for the cut to change it .
And so that 's a very much of the identity is a question of scels is a kind of scels , like you can 't want to move to . " We don 't want to the kids . " We 're not want to the right time to the right time . "
And we can invented how many times we can do .
which means that every morning , the answer , the answer that kind of person want to be .
I was going to the family and matririmonium , a time , a common , and it was that you could be that the most . And he was that we could be able to the most possible .
The only truth with who was with who , not when you do after .
On it was really to play .
I mean , very smart students , and I have the 20 percent in less than the work .
And it 's not because they 're not because they 're not because they 're not not fly .
But why are they impensierites , I mean , " Doo you can 't be ? "
" I would like to slater , I had to think before the or career ? "
I 'm interrogatic .
And they 're trying to answer to these questions , even if this implics , you can 't completely buy the beautiful and not get a beautiful vote .
And they have to do it . I 'm really important .
Now , the work : we 're lucuncar , as Carl sound , because technology , the technology to work , every day , every day , every day , every day , every day , the transpent that from Hotel Randph .
It was a parently , there 's a hangoline , and I won 't tell you that , where the WiFi works .
I don 't have to say , because I want to use it .
What means , this incredible liberation of sceless we have about it to work ? And what we have to keep , and if we have to work or no .
We can go to see our figure out , with the cell , with the cell , the Blackberry in the other , and the notion , and the nect .
And even if they 're all spent , every minute that we see our son , we 're also asking the partment , we 're also asking this called " ? "
" I had to answer to this email ? I had this literally ? "
And also when the answer is " no , all this makes experience of your driver of your driver very different from what would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the things , little , little things , things , which is a lot of life , life , life is a question of life , the life is a question of scape .
One time the world was this : Oval world , there were some possibility , but it was not a question of choice .
The world today is the world today : The degree is , " That 's a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is South .
The positions of the slies , so I 'm going to talk about the people .
And all of this choice two effects of the people .
The first , the first , is that produces instead of instead that liberation .
I mean , I 'm going to be very hard to do it .
I want to offer an example : one studio , a studio of the floor of fly fly .
A college of the data of the Vanks of the Vanks , the gigantesis , with about about a million clients of clients , with about a billion clients in 2,000 different company .
And what she found was that for every 10 solutions that they 're offering in more , the most , the most of adesion .
With 50 percent of offerts , there 's 10 percent in the midd----fast . Why ?
Because with 50 pours of the floor , it 's maledy , and the sceles is to decide , and the wind is to the questions .
And I still have , and again , and I still ask questions , and of course , and of course , I 'm going to ask .
You know that you don 't only think these works from the old old food for cannot , because they 're not going to be , because they 're also to say that the decision is so that the decision is so that they 're also to be the source of the dator of work .
We 're not not going to be saying , they 're along to five dollars from the dator of work , that would be true .
So the paralive is a consequence of the pattern .
And I think that makes the world .
" And I finally , for the eternity : ketchup , send ,
You can actually take the decision , if it 's the right , if it 's the elected , right ?
You don 't want to choose the source , and neppputs the conditive .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can get the paralive and do a sceless , and we can do a fast , at less than we would be able to be as a result of the result that we would have been with .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of these is that I wake , if you comprecognize , it 's not perfect , it is to imagine that you would have a different scale that would be better . And what happens is that happening is that it would be better . And what happens is the way to be better . And that 's the extent , and the recognize the way , and the fresighborn ,
And when it was a decision .
And there 's more easy , more easy is , more easy of any ddisappeared to the option of the option .
And there is the economists are the opportunity to be opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has been very good at the value of the value that we see the things that we see from what we 're going to the things that we 're going to do .
And in the rest , when there are many options , it 's easy to represent the career of the alternative of the alternative options that you 're going to be less than the options that you is scape .
Here 's a example . I 've been in New York .
But it 's what you 're probably thinking about .
There 's this copy .
It 's a place of luser .
It 's beaves . Oton . Oton .
I don 't have anything . But what he think is , " Well , disease , it 's Agod . "
" All of my neighborhood . "
" I could save it from the home . "
And I 'm past two weeks that 's allow to the idea that 's allow -- the possibility of parking where it .
The opportunity to be the defation for what we have , when the floor when the sceless was .
And more than the options that we have to be more than the career , more than the meet to be conscious .
Here 's another example .
This vignize us a lot of things .
We have the time , and maybe of the time , and maybe of the living .
But the most important point is that any important thing is that you can see the other way , you know , not to do other .
And the things that we don 't have to attractive that can make less less than we do .
I 'm going to be expensive .
I tried on my pattern a new couple of jeans .
I was almost always jeans .
One time , the jeans were only a kind of compraves and vestide , they were dissimilar , they were discovered , only after after after after after after after , just after it , they started to go to well .
So , I went to compraring a new new when the old old one of the old old , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my table . "
The hit said , " Li wants to slim , easy easy , relaxed ? "
He wants with the cernian , or the bottons ? " Stonewashed " or " " " or " Do ?
" Let 's want to strake ? "
" Sott them want to the free .
I was sitted , and after a little bit , and after a little bit of , " I want to say , " I want to say , " I want to 't have a way to me . And then I was not , so for all the things . And then , I was used to get the best jects , and then you have been doing .
It was the massive . We 're going to get the best .
But I feel worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all that scels was that I was perfected , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was the beginning to me . I didn 't expected anything that when I was just a kind of excepted , when you only have a kind of different , when you go to 100 different , you 're going to be perfect .
And what I was good , but I didn 't perfect .
I was going to have a weless with what I was trying to me to insoon the expected by the expected to the expected .
The options of the life of the people don 't do the expected expected to the physics .
And this is going to be less sometimes , when the result , you 're good .
Nobody in the world of the marketing world .
Because if you know , I didn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth of the most of the more than this .
" He was better when he was worse when he was worse . " The reason that he was better when he was worse when he was worse .
On the world we live in the world , industry , industry , industry with the expection of the perpersual -- the massive , the massive things are going to hope is that the things are to the test of the expectative .
You never have surprised , because the vote your expected , the middle , you 're ingiven .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- which is , " Basse , " Yes , " Yes , " Yeah , you want . "
I mean , a little bit of that -- that 's actually actually actually actually actually , and my wife is really study .
I won 't have to do better , I don 't have to me .
But it 's not always a good thing .
And then , a consequence of the jecosystem in when there is only that kind of jeans is that when you don 't have to be , and I asked you , and I asked you , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " " Well , the answer is .
The world is the world is the responsible . What can you do ?
When you have hundreds of jeans , and you 're going to a hundred insoon , and you ask you , and you ask you , is the responsible to you .
You have been able to do better .
With a hundreds of varietetetety , not scale for the insuccess .
So when people are going to decisions , even if the result is valize , they 're going to insoon and they will have the college .
In the last years , the last years of the world 's expression in the world industralized .
I think a fatter phactor -- not the only , but important -- of this onto -- of this is that the people have experiences because the people have experiences because the standard is too much .
And when they 're explain this situation is their colpa .
So the result is that we 're doing , which is a lot of objected , but we heard worse .
Let me recognize .
This is the dogame , which is the dogame , what we all take for good and it is completely fall .
There 's no no bad that a little bit of choice is better than not not have to be better than that you don 't have to be better than that you 're better than a little bit better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we have been superperperfored by a piece of the best in which the best life .
Now , from the point of view -- I 've been on -- from the point of the political , the nocycle is the following .
And I think that allows all this scelds in society , is the recognize .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you 're going to talk about the problem is that they have a won 't have a lot of choice .
The problem is that they 're too poor .
So the easy of which I 'm talking about is a disease of modern , recognize that society .
And what does it have to be and arring is this : Steve Levitt has talked about how those those expensive and discover .
I mean , I mean , these choose choices and dispends , it 's not just inutile .
I 'm aditting of the eteries .
We do it worse .
If you have a little bit of what in our society allows the choice was reversed in those who have been too population , not only their life , but also , our life , it would be better but also our life .
This is what the economists is a better better pareting .
One redied of the redent redent , not only to the poverty -- not only to poverty -- to be able to the extremely .
For , " Fanol , you can become all the everything that you want to --
You can see , people in culture , you think , " But what 's creds this fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't have any bocks . "
" Afeting , a vision of limitate , "
And I was the beginning to the beginning .
But then , I think , instead , I 'm rest that that fish the long .
Because the reality is that if you get the bottom , you can 't get the bottom , " all of it is possible . You don 't have the liberation .
If you 're going to be the bottom that all of the possible defation .
Atouch the paralysis , and reducing the welling .
All of a fety .
This is almost of course , it 's very much , maybe for the fish , and sure for us .
But the fy without some symbolic became for infecicity and , for the rovine .
Thank you very much .
