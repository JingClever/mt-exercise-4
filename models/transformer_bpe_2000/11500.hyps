The year I showed these slide demonstrate that the glacial artics , which is almost three million years of the 48 States , which is the size of 48 States continental , you 're record , it 's record of 40 percent .
But this subjects this subjects the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the spector of the ice .
The calculus is , a calculation is , in a sense , the cubularctic , the custommate system .
It 's exactly switch and you reach .
The next next slide is going to be a carlate carlaughed on the last 25 years .
The ice lost of lost , they 're signed in red .
As you see , you expensive , you know , you know , you know .
That 's the ice in , which is the ice in , which is record .
You can see that the ice cosidgn , of five years or more , is like the site , which is , like the site , which is , that 's like the site .
In 25 years , it 's been in this .
This is a problem because the interest is the interest with the thirlaced around the ocean , where there are huge amount of carbon congelated , scientists , they 're transformed in metane .
Right to totality of the atmosquare from the current rescale , that might be radddopppppppppppppppppppleasure .
In some laghi , you can profound in Alaska metane is already rebuling from water .
The professoression Katey Walter of the University of Alaska , a team taka , a bunch of bottom-taka .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : I 'm going to be .
A reason is that this term exhic exhic exhibition from the northern north .
This is a glacial record .
The brought never reached .
This is the Kangerlusliant field , in the sud-west , in the west of Groenland .
If you want to know how to know how the level of the ice of the ice of ice , here is where we reach the waste , here is where we reach the mare .
These corrings are are increasing rapidly .
On the other side of the planet : Antartttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttarttttttttttttartttttttttttttttttarttttttttttttttttttttarttttt
The month shows the scientists have dichimped that the ice of the ice is in negative , and that Antarctarttartttarttttartttarly , it 's particularly rapid , is particularly rapid .
It 's a six meters of the acive , as a Greenland .
On Himalaya , the third biggest block , you see new laghi , which few years ago were gone .
The 40 percent of the world 's population was going to be a population of the population .
Sulle Ande : this ice is the source of water .
The brought is increased .
But when they diminures , the same accepts to the water .
In California , the neve on the Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The gets are in crisis in .
The predictions , like you read , you know , they 're free .
The growth is a secity of the world 's growth of the incends .
The environmental disaster are increasing out of the normal and without precedental .
Four times more number of them in the last 30 years , you know , 75 .
This is an unsustainable beyond .
If you look at it in the context if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we add 70 million tons of CO2 , every 24-hours of tons of tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the Pacific area of the Pacific , from the Americans , to the west , and on the west of the subcontinent , where there 's a radical impoverty .
The major causes of global warming , together to the deforest , which is the 20 percent , it 's the use of combustic combustic .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with the most emissions , together at China .
And you proposed to build a lot of other coal .
But we 're seeing a change of direction .
These are the projects annation in the last years and some projects of a verage of alternative versus .
Some , there 's a politics in our country .
The carbon industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year for the last year for the carbon , which is a bunch of carbon , which is a bunch .
I remember me to something --
I want to see Natal Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion liters of carbon scories .
You 've seen it on the news .
This is the second flow of scories in America .
It 's success around Natal .
The public public industries of one was this .
Video : ♫ ♫ Frosty the carbon is a bunch of a allegro and happy .
It 's abondant here in America , and it 's going to grow our economy .
Frosty the carbon is always more .
It 's a good price , adorable , and the workers are hard .
Al Gore : Al Gore : West Virginia .
The greatest society on the montags is Massey Coal . This is his friendly . This is his love .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'm going to clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Peloi , Harry Reid -- not know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So Alleance for the Protetion of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , a part .
Video : ALergy : All COLergy see the climate change as a serious minaces in our business .
For this priority is to investment a great amount of money in a such such a public advertion-blind truth and confused to the truth of carbon .
In fact , the carbon is not sport .
We think it 's a good thing -- it 's also a good good .
So it doesn 't preocupateves .
Let 's do us .
Video : Actor : Carbone , you heard a lot of .
So , you know , a gyon a structure to the structure that you look at the carbon .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little bit of the carbon , but this is the sound of the carbon .
We 're consumption is between the main cause causes of global warming , but the night is the carbon technology that you see changes .
You have a look . This is the ownern technology .
Al Gore : I finally , the alternative is connects to the economic issue and that of the national security .
Video : Comvation : The America is in America is in ; the economy , the national crisis .
The fiddle colleages all : our dependence from combustic combustic , as the carbon oil and the importantly .
Now , I 'm going to be a new , audence , solution for using .
Repower , America : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A piano to put the work of America to make it worth , and help us stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that baby to solution .
Repower . Scover America .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's about reach energy to America .
One of the fast ways to bring us to the end of the dependence from the comics that kills our planet .
What it 's going to it : The future is here . I just just like , a new energy .
What does two two : Nuovui investments for places of bad .
Comics : Repower . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A tiny proverbio says , " If you want to go fast , you go from .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We need to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
They go to TED at TED fecull on LHC .
And I promise to record to the nars on how it works .
So , I 've got to those who were not , the LHC is the largest experiment . And the LHC is the largest experiment .
His a compelling is to remember the conditions that were less than a second of a second of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
This is just just environment .
This is the Ginevra .
We 're taking these mini-Bang Bang inside .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- it 's larger , it 's a 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building this .
The 10 tembers will score the last year we have acceserate the car for the first .
And this picture was taken by AS .
It 's because of immense fests in the saving of control .
It 's a picture of the first phasm of particles that had done everything the LHC , both , both in collision , with a part of LHC , and spondling particles in the craft .
In other words , when we see that image that image 10 settembers , we understand that the machine was , which is a great vicity .
I don 't know if it was this to do it , when somebody went on Google and vide that I go on Google and vide that the beginning was this .
What means we 've got a cultural impact .
It was a week after , there was a problem with the machine , it was a problem with this dams here -- these dored dored dorges .
They bring 13,000 prints are 13,000 prints when the machine works .
Now , the technicians are going to be looking at the files and tell , " It 's not true . They 're paying , "
And instead can do it because when they 're very cosidans become cosidans .
So , at least 271 , at a temperature inferior in the stars , these files can bring that corrupon .
In one of the gy-novehices in LHC , there was a fect of floor .
So the files you rewarming , and the 13,000 prints of a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is more impressive if you think these magnetic fish , and that 's several fish , and that 's spoke of about 30 centimeters .
There are damage about 50 magnetic .
We had to take them , what we 've done .
We repress and repristed and repress .
Now , they 're returning all the place .
I mean , the end of the LHC will be again .
We 're going to get this , and we expect to get to the right right right now , and we continue our adventure to discovering what are the next morning that are the next morning .
Now , of course , in a quickly , these accidents reacting the dibate value of science and engineering in frontier of the engineering . It 's easy to confuture .
I think the fact that the fact that it 's so difficult , I think it 's the limits , I think it 's the value of things like LHC .
I want to conclude with the words of a scientist Inglish , Humphrey Davy Davy , which , in the defense of the experiments of his publisher , and he 's bouldn 't be much dangerous , and he said , " Nichael Faraday , " Nichael Faray , which is not about how the ideas of science of science is that we don 't have to be completely , which we don 't know , which we 're not completes in our samamamamamamamming . "
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to start to rethink when children , you play with children .
While you understand how to reach them and truly , and they 're going to take them and move , learning , learned to think and learned to think about resolving and remaining relationships .
The space is the space of space is property to the way we understand a part of the world around us .
So , by information , from the exhibition of our interaction with objects , together at my physical consulsult , and my collaborator , and my collaborator Kalanithi , I started to ask me , " And if we 're a computer , instead of the mouse , instead of the mouse , and we can do the crazy on a deskey , and I could sleeps on a physical information with a little handle .
and sistemulate our plenty ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the answer , building the Sift-tail answer .
In points , a Siftable computer is a whole computer interactive as a birth .
In points , a Siftable computer is a whole computer interactive as a birth .
You can move with hand , they can see , " you can see , " between them , you know , you know , and they have a radio radio and a radio radio .
But most of physics , I 'm physics , like the morning , you can just move .
The Siftable is of a new ecosystem for ecosystem for manipulate information .
And as a lot of physics , consciously , the other , of the other , and as they become more physics , consciously , the other , of how we move them , we can exploring the new totally standing them and different tells of interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configured to show of video : if you including it in a direction , the video running is , if you including on the other hand .
These record are conscious conscious .
If you look at them , you know what it 's about what it is their around .
If you 're circulated , and they can get a little bit .
If you 're circulated , and they can get a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We 've got to realize that one of the interactions was the power of interaction was the power of data , to " the data , " further as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurated as a truth of verny and I can use them to the color in the color , where you missing .
and I can use them to use them to the color in the central color , where you missing .
If we 're too much , we can put a little bit about .
You 're also beautiful to apprice , as a languages , the mathematics and logs of logics where people can try and see the fast , and you can see the result , and you get the result .
Now , I 'm now --
This is a Fibonacusequence .
We have a word of words that 's half of a words that 's half of the Boggle .
Pratically , at every turn a literally , in a literally , Pratically , to every turn a letter , at every turn , and you get a letter in a letter of hyththird , and while certain of them to compories on a dippattern .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you get a new set of lectiny , and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here 's those kids came to the Media Lab , I did them and I did them and I took them and gone of a video .
They 're very much .
And one of the things of this kind of application is that you have to have a lot of education .
You just say , " I 'm going to say , " I 'm going to them to be .
Here 's how other people who try it .
This is our head more young , there 's a right there .
It really wanted to just impilate them .
They 're just just honces , for him .
Now , this is a competition of a interactive application .
We wanted to build a tools for the languages of Lui Lui is Felix .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving the Sift-to-associated .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving the Sift-to-associated .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sole is source .
David Merrill : Now he took a tractor in the scene .
Video : The arange atter .
Bel work ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Y
So , I got Siftable and put up neighbors can be interact with the characters .
Video : Bau !
-- inventing their story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It 's a story with final story , and it can decide him as you want .
DM : It 's a story with final story , and it can decide him as you want .
Video : I 'm going to get .
DM : The last example I 've got the time to show you a tool , realized , to figure out and exef , to saying , and exequal music .
It 's a tool , realized , to figure and exef music .
The Siftable here are across from sound as well , based and the bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose to choose .
You can insert these sound on a sequence of blood into your feet .
And modified it just making a suund , " and a sequence . "
These are actually actually that you can control from vision , like the reverbs and the filter .
You know , you know , you know , you inclyers to enage it .
And then there are the general effects like time and fly , which you applicate to the intersequence .
We look like this .
Video : DM : We 're going to put a base in two Siftable , " We 're going to put in a series , we add the extend , we add the other base .
Now I put a line of a line .
Video : Now , I add some percussions . Now ,
Video : And I 'm going to put the bacteria , so I can control the battery , so I can control the effect .
Video : I can fast the intersequence , and you know , in the time from one side or the other .
Video : And I 'll give the filter on the basis to give more expression .
Video : I can recombining the sequence . "
So I didn 't have to plan , but I can improve it , but I can improve ,
And now , finally , I can do you get the intersequence to sequence the left Siflight flight . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is build new interface , and more more sound and more sound than than our brain works .
And today , I had time to show you one of the result of this performs , and also some possibility that we try to bring out from the lab .
The concept that I want to take is that it 's coming up to this new generation of objects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk with all you .
They 're a written .
I 'm going to realize books is my profession , but it 's more than that .
It 's also the love and the love of my life .
And I don 't expect me that can change .
But , I said , something particular happened in my life and in my career , which has taken me to recognize the whole report with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called " Manogy , Prega , Am , " the fun , the different books of my precedently , for some reason used to be a big sensitional sensatisatisfic .
And the result is that everywhere , you know , people are now , people like I 'm condanned .
Daveling -- condanned , condanned .
They 're going to get all worried and say , " I don 't get to be able to do better than than doing better ?
You don 't have to be to write for all life without power without power to be able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can important book ? "
that can important somebody do it ? "
It 's rassure , you know .
But it could go , part of that I remember that I was a more than 20 years ago , when I started to say , I was a adolescent -- I was a written .
I would be meet to the same gap .
And people say , " Don 't temes to be able to be successful ?
Don 't you know , the use of the rified of the rified you ?
You don 't have to be doing this mestial for all of life without that nothing is to be out of a heart of the heard of the sometimes of driving with the both of a binfrants of binfrants of daming ,
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yes , I 've got all those things .
I 've always had a pture .
And I also have a lot of other things that people can not inate .
As the algaes and other things .
But , how I look at the time , I was going to write what I was going to be why ?
It 's rational ?
It 's logical that anyone to expect to be spent by a job that you 've been born to do .
But what 's about this is that in the impress creative impress to make us nervous health health health as well as well as other cars do not do ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and not remember a solving time in 40 years of activity where he was asked if she was asked to be engineer ?
It was never -- that blows about the engineer John , how it was ?
Do it didn 't work like that , you know ?
Onestly , engineers like chemicals , they don 't certainly , in the secles , driven the reputation of being high hands .
We writers , we have enough , and we 're not just to be creative , but creative reputation of every gender , we have this reputation of being huge .
And you 're not going to look at the trils of the magnific magnifies that , just in the venture century , they died and often , they died and often .
And those who are not suicipate data , they 're actually disdisappears .
Norman Mailer , before I die , in the last interview said , " Ogn my book or books or a little bit more fashion .
But we don 't bad to be when we heard these things , because we 've heard these things , we 've been completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and acceptated the notion and the art , it 's going to be in a way , and it 's going to be in the end , in the end .
And the question I want to bring all over today is : you 're saying with this idea ?
It 's good at this thing -- because I also look at a centimeter , I 'm not going to be good for nothing .
I think it 's odiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodio
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated .
I think it 's better to encouraging our big creative minds .
And I 'm sure that , in my case -- I would be very dangerous to begin to start to the dark , I was a little bit of the substances , especially drill , I 'm in my career .
It 's really -- I 'm looking at , I 'm pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I 'm like , I 'm going to be like 40 years .
I 've got about four decadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadecadeca
And it 's a lot of likely that any time I 'm going to be right now right now , and it 's going to be right after spent .
I 'm going to be , because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's likely to my walks .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that bring a person to start to start to get a person in the noine , and I don 't want to do it .
I would stop to keep this work that we love .
So , the question becomes , how do it ?
And so I seems to look , after many reflective , which the way to work to keep the psychological costruck , right ?
I had a few way to find a security of sure , which I 'm written , and my natural natural , and my natural anxior , and I was going to get all the time , and I was trying to look through the time , and I was looking through the time , looking at the time , looking for the best society to see if we could have the best ideas and more searing and more seighborn and more seants and more seishing ideas .
about how to help people create the inherents to make the inherents of creativity .
And that research has taken me to the antics Great Rome .
I 'm going to do it because it was in circle and then back .
Nelil Great Rome and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that the creativity came from men , OK ?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit of the spirit of them , and that came to holds from one of a few source , for reasons and soubling , for reasons .
We call this demons of the spirits of creativity . "
Sock , wonderful , created to have a demon that elargives from the landwisdom from the land-away .
The Romans were of the same idea , but called that kind of spirit without a genius .
which is great , because Romans didn 't really think that a genius was not really smart .
They have to be that a genius was that kind of entity that you believe that it 's going to live in the murs of the study of a study , a little bit like the elfter Dobby , and that came out of a nurtells of the articulate work and the result of the work of the work of the work of the work .
It 's a deeption--- that 's the distance of which is the distance of which is the psychological that you protegen from the result of your work .
And everybody had had that was so that was so , right ?
So , the arts were protected by certain things , like for example , for example , not ?
If your work was exceptional , you can 't get all the mercially , all of them had been helped by this genius .
If your work fallide , it was not all all colpleasure , right ?
And everybody who knew that was to be a incapable .
So people han , the creativity in Occident Occident for a long time .
And then Rinascivement came and everything changed , and nacial , and we put the human being in the center of the universe of the universe , and the misters and more leave with the misters and without more leaving space .
This was the main of human rational and the people started thinking about that creativity was completely by the ishared .
And for the first time in history , you start to restop this or that , as a piece of a piece that I 'm going to a piece of a person .
And I 've got to tell , I think was a big herror .
I think that allow someone , a simple person to believe how a recipent recipient , the beautiful , the beautiful and the surgers of all the misters , creatives , inosciate and a responsibility to give a lot of a humanity .
It 's how to ask somebody to ingoes .
Deform and distores completely the ego and creates all these inestablished wait on performance .
And I think it was this pression to the arts in the past 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think it 's , and I think it 's going to be ?
Can we can do it fun ?
Maybe , to a more more of human relationship between human relationship and mistery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't cancer 500 years of thinking rational in a talk of 18 minutes .
And there 's people between the audience that would be laittims that would read scientific nectells on the necture , unsom , you know , they follow people to do it .
You know , you know about this thing .
But what would like to bring is -- why not ?
Why don 't you think about this way ?
Because it 's more than ever ever heard to explain the exasperts of the process of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever , so , all here -- it 's not compories .
And , in fact , it can sometimes it looks like it .
I did this meetesis with the extraordinary poetesse , which has 90 years , but it 's 90 years , but it was a little bit of a poetesis , and he was a little bit of childhood in the Virginia , and he was working in the fields , and he was in the crazy , and he was in the mixy .
I said , I was like a broken trends .
And that was rotoling to her from the landscape .
And it turns out to get , because he was so so so much .
He would like to have a sold what to do about that point , and he was , words like a main . "
And so he went to house and came to slow up from this poety , and it would not have to have to be a piece of cards and a mathematics , and a mathemats , while the traphion , and the page .
Of times , I couldn 't be fast enough , so correct and running without able able able to get into the house and , the poem was in house and , he would keep up to the craft , and he would keep up through the landscape , and he would keep up to the landscape . "
And then there were those times -- this piece of the piece , I will never dimentiched , OK ?
So , he was saying to the house and was trying to card and the poem was going through , and he was a walking , and he was a mathemath , and then he was like , and he was like you sleep with the other hand and the wind .
He was the poetic poeia from the code and reput it in his body and truck on the page .
And in these cases , the poem is going to be presented on the perfect page , from the last word at the first word at the first word at the first word .
So when I thought I 'm thinking about -- it 's a purpose , it 's exactly equal process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a music , and my way to work is ; I 'm a music , and I 'm going to get and go and I 'm going to work and passion-taken .
But I even even , I know , in my head , I bought to meet that .
And I 'm also going to be a lot of you the han .
You know , even if the work and the ideas came to me from a certain tells , you can 't even even though it .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relationships to be not to do it , but , rather , rather , which is that we do do it ?
For how I look at me , the best example of the contemporary contemporary , which I 've been the Tom Waits , which I interview different years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of the life was the incarnation of the articulation of the extending control , by trying to control , to dominate these species of impults .
But then I invected , and I went , and a day as he was driving on a calculations to Los Angeles , changed everything .
He was going to go fast and all of a sent tract this little framment of meloair , which is in his head as it does does as a mindle , and the telling , and the telling , and it 's just beautiful , and it 's not known , but it doesn 't know how to take it .
It 's not a piece of card , not a mathematical register .
So , I started to feel this species of old old , and I 'm going to lose , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'll bmarried from this song .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of go to the panic , you stop .
I 'm going to put the whole process and it was something completely new .
And I 'm going to just look at the sky and said , " Scususes , " Don 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" You know , you know , you know , you know , you know , " Is ?
If you really want to existing , you 're going to be a more opposite .
Othern , you walk to do anything .
You 're going to disturbing Leonard . "
And his process , he worked after this .
I don 't work , the work was still known as a always .
But the process , and the fish that was requires , when the genius was required when the genius , the genius of him , the genius of the problems and fliberated to where it was , and I realize that I wasn 't had to be a whole thing and realized .
but it turns out this peculiar , wonderful bizar-collaboration between Tom and this strange , and this strange and exernal thing that allowed was not Tom .
So how I heard that story is to change a little bit also the way I was working on and I already save me .
This idea , I 'm saving , when I was written , " Manogy , Am , " and cadds in one of those cave of the disperation that we 're working on something and we 're working on something and we can 't start to think that it will be a disaster , which is going to be the worse .
Not just burn , just the worst books .
And I started thinking about garing this project .
But then I remember Tom , I talk about the air and try .
So I allow my face on the high and I recognize my foundation of the room .
And I said , " Sents , " Sents , what 's both you know if this book is not going to be blue , not be interactly my , no longer ?
Because as I 'm seeing all I 'm put all that I have no more than this .
So if you want to be better , you have to give you a little bit more .
OK . But if you do not , you know , you know , I don 't do it .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I want to do that I want to do that I 'm now now to me to do my part of the last is , OK -- to the end , OK -- secoli ago , OK -- secoli does the deserts of Africa was soubleasure to the clear of clear , and music and the hours of the hours that were going to hours , and the high .
And they were always magnific , because the ballers were professionals and were fantastic .
But every so , so , it 's something happened , and one of these artists was actually transcent .
And I know what you know about , because I know you 've seen , at a point , a way that you 've got all .
It was like the time , and the ballerin , and the ballerin a ballerin a ballowing and not doing anything that was doing anything about the sun , but it was all sorting .
And at the improvise not just like a human .
But it 's going to be accinese , under the focused in the fuel of divinity .
And when this happened , you know , when I had what was , they called the As .
They had the hands and , they were starting to cantate , " Allah , Allah , God , God , God , God . "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note stories -- when Ms invasered the sound of Span , the preserve of the pleasure , and the pronunce , " Allah , Allah , Allah , " " Olay , " " Os , " that you can hear in the corride .
In Spay , when a clear articularticulation , " Allah , " Allah , " Allah , I was a bad , I was a burch of God .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem is the next day , for the ballerin the ballerin , when you see it 's 11 of the Martedine , and I won 't have more .
It 's just a mortal with ginoccurrently , and maybe it will not be able to listening to to that alteach that altezy .
And maybe nobody will be the name of God still as it was what it has to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most pain to do in a creative life .
But maybe it 's not to have to be so ances that if you can 't believe , if you can 't believe , the most extraordinary , which is the most extraordinary of your being being from from you .
But created by a purpose that you 're going to be able to a squisity of this squisity part of your life that you have to get to any other when you 're finished .
And , you know , if we think about this way .
And so I started thinking , and it 's sure , and it 's sure how I thought I was very different , I 'm going to be in the book , I 'm going to do , I 'm going to the rest , I 'm going to follow , I 'm going to follow up my great success .
And what I have to keep up when I feel electric bedded by this is , not to be .
Not to choice . It 's just your work .
It 's a little bit of your part , whatever , whatever , whatever could be .
If your work is balling , balls .
If the divine , I assumped to leave some of a wonderful way to leave some kind of wonderful , for one time through your forces , then you know , " Os ! "
You 're doing the same tube .
" Os ! " " Os you know .
I think it 's about it .
" On it ! "
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I 've already talked about this human genome on the human genes , what can meaning and discovery of new genes .
Now we 're starting a new way : we started digitalize biology , and now to start to the biology and now to start to the digital biology , we 're going to design and saying , design and sinteting and saying , and synthesizing life .
We 've always tried to bring great questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many biologs I think they have tented to figure out of livels .
We 've tried a different approperties , reduced it .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was was to spend from the world of the world of biology in the digital world .
Now we ask us : we can regenerate life , or new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma , which is the most small as a little bit of the genome that can autorem in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to make a little more smaller .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of the 500 that are here .
But when we look at his maps to his maps , it 's relatively simple answer to our .
I think , that 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very improbrought to a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to provide to provide this was going to synthesize this cromosphere to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the avventure of the " Point we can synthesize a cromosom ? "
It can 't be the chemicals to produce these great molecules that we never never recently to create before ?
And in case , in case , we can do a cromosom ?
A cromosom is just a piece of chemical material .
The speed with that we 're able to digitalize life is growing to be exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , degree rather , but it 's better .
And our most recent result to a exponential curve on a exponential curve .
We 've started more than 15 years ago .
The process has requires a lot of pass , starting with a bioetics before we 're going to begin .
But we found that we 've found that DNA is very difficult .
There are thousands of machines of DNA world that producing little segments of DNA , the long cleaning , and it 's a degenerative process : the most segment process is longer , the segment is more herrors .
So we had to develop a new metodo to develop these framments and correct these framments and record .
And this is our first tentative first , to start digital information from the Phi , 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills .
We 've designed the framments , effected the correction of the errors and get a molecule of DNA of about 5,000 lectiny .
The part is the interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material , we 've inserious in bacteria , the bacteria have started to read this genetic code and degrees in the viral particles .
The viral particles are re-leaved by cells , they 're back and distrutt .
I talked about recently recently , the oil industry , which they have certainly compress that they have certainly compress .
They remember .
We believe that this is a situation where software can really build the same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things like this .
We wanted to build the whole cromosoma of the bacteria .
They 're more than 580 miles of code code .
So we thought we 've been thinking about the seven of the virus , so that we could change the casss of the virus to understand what the components are of a living cellent .
The design is crucial property , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accuratory was a herror for every 10 miles .
We found , we found , 30 herrors . If we had used to get that original sequence , we 're going to be able to be able to do that .
One part of the process is designing segments that we have to have a lot of the pattern that are suddens with all the other segments of 50 lectinity of their own segments of them .
We 're going to be a unique of this .
You know , you know , you know , we 're going to be in the fiflower .
So , think that 's so that we have a genetic code on four lectiny , and T.
Three of those lectiny with a codify , and there 's a specific order to record for every love .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , framework , depensive .
What we did we do about the beginning was self-doing .
Some of the fact that it was the fact that it wasn 't .
We 've designed these segments to just just to do them with exists .
There are them to repear them and put them .
And we started to do with segments , starting with segments , starting with segments from five to segments , unending a way to make segments of 24 miles to get to get 72 mies .
We 've been produced these sequency in a pattern , so that we 're going to make a very few of a building that we 're taking process to create a very very good process .
We 're looking for automationomatize the process .
So , this looks like the tabellon a playwake .
When we 're going to these very long long , more than 100 miles , the most of 100 miles , they 're not going to grow in Ecoli .
You get to the limits of the modern of biology .
So we 've been looking at other mechanisms .
We had another mechanism called recombination recombination , which in biology , which is using biology to repair the DNA to be able to sunch .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus , can absorbs three million running .
You can see in the sudperior like his cromosoma gap .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly how before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely secate .
They can be under vacuum .
They 're absolutely certain that life exists in space , and you know , you know , to find new water .
It 's true , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we 've built by using these processes , just using the lights with the segments of segments from inserious to insert .
The light-assemble .
This image is not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule that we can see it with a microscope with a microscope .
These are pictures that are a time of about six seconds .
This is the published we 've done long ago .
They 're more than 580,000 lect-code .
It 's the most great molecule , the most of a defined of the structure .
It 's a fish soon to 300 million .
If we stop it with a careful cars , you would like 142 , we would like 142 page to transck this code .
Now , how do we do it work ? How do we do it ?
Of course , tramitely , you know , a virus is a game from kids .
It 's a little more complicated when they use bacteria .
It 's also simpler when it 's a cell of cell euclear as as our : you can just extract the nucleo and inserious process .
In the bacteria , the bacteria is integrated in in the cell , but we have recently demonstrate that we 're able to do a transplant of a bunch of a cell .
We can have a cromosom from a parting of a microbial species .
The two are different than holds as holds .
We 've add a few gene in the most way to decide what I walk for this cromosom .
And then the sciolences , and then I was killed with the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was study -- and appreciate our graphic sophisticatooos -- the new cell cell .
And we were thinking that we can 't go on , but we 've tried to spend up to be more in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms .
We found that we 've got a third of a third or a third cromosometimes from a second , adgets a second thousands of tracts of tracts .
So who think about evolution as a only gene at evolution is just understanding of biology .
There are the exists called " restription is that adtells the digeriss are digerism .
The cromosom that was in the cells not .
The cell phone that we have inserious . We have inserit------hundred .
And it 's expressed , and he recognized the other cromosoma as a material , and we 're ritting with only the cell and we 're returromosom .
It 's became blue because of genes we 've been inserious .
And in a short of time , all the carteristic carteristic , and you have lost lost , and it 's transformed in a new species , based on the new software that we inserious in the cell .
All proteins are changed , the membraning , and when we read the genetic code , and when we read the genetic code .
Now , this might look at the genetics , but altering the software , but altering the software . We can change things in a lot of sustained enough enough .
Now , I 've already explained that you don 't talk about genesis , but of the property of the evolution , and I 've told that maybe we 're already told that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of species on this process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's enough , when we think about our needs .
We 're going to spend from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each other . In 1946 ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We 're going to see food now , water fresh , water and clean , medicinal and balance , medicine and a half billion people .
It 's going to be more draw .
We 're more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion baries , more than 30 billion baries .
That means millions of baries at the day .
When we try to find biological processes , or whatever , or whatever it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We need to have a lot of the CO2 of this CO2 materials that finishes in the atmosphere .
Al day , thank you to find scientific discoveries in all the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are the components for the future .
The electronics industry only only has a dozen about components , and think about how many things are come out .
Our limits here are very biological and we 're imagination .
Now we have techniques , thank you very much methods of synthesization , in order to create what we call genomics combinatory .
We 're able to build a big robots that can produce a million cromosomes in the day .
You think of processing these 20 million genes or different genes or to try to be a lot of the processes to produce or drugs , new vaccine , new vines , we can change , thank you , thank you very much biology .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose to be a chance of survive , production , production chemicals or carbons , production , etc .
This is an istantanea of some software programmed on that we 're working for to be able to seat and design species to make a computer .
Well , we don 't need to be .
We know exactly what is their genetic code .
Now we 're going to be concentrating the carbons of quarters .
You also saw you that extract from the grate was a finished experiment .
We have carbon others and third generation that are going to use enough to be a carbons of carbons of bigger than the highest value as a different kinds of butanole .
But the only way biology can have a great impact without increasing without increase without increase the cost of food and limitars the dispon-to be transforming CO2 in matter , which we 're working on the cell that we 're working on the cell that we 're working on the coal .
The sunlight solar with CO2 is a metodom -- but in our discoveries in all the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we 've been described in 1996 .
It 's in the ocean , about 2500 feet of deep-foundity of the water .
They 're put from CO2 , they 're going to hydrogen as a molecular energy .
We 're looking for figure out if we can incannot be transported by figure out , convertional convertising that CO2 in carbons , to driving that .
So , we 're going to be able to increase what we could be able to increase what is the question of " which is " We 're Noil , truth , we have the modness of remainy requires .
Exactly . If you don 't do it from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main the energy .
And we 're working for using the same metods of using the same metods of instantants .
You saw this year with influence , we 're always back to a year and with a dollar when it 's track is to find the right right .
I think that this can change , so that you can build fighting combines in anticipats .
So , this is how the future could start to look at change , now , the treatment of evolution , acceping the evolution with bacteria , and you 're inally , and inally infinally , and inally inally cell eucariariote .
We 're so so much as much as the best people .
Our is to do it , so long enough to be able to do it . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
But I 'll give you , the most rapidly possible , some fundamental work , some fundamental work , we 've taken to the Microsoft in the following of a year ago ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a local environment that you can interact is to the local level that remote with a enormous amount of data .
We 're seeing a lot of photographytelling a photographs with a photographs , and a fast , and they 're going to a quickly panoramounic , disponing the images of how we want .
And it doesn 't matter how great amount of information that we see , how big are these things that are great tells of data or images .
Most of the photographs are digital photographs , but this is a provent scansion from Biiiiiished by the Biiiiished 300 megapixel .
It doesn 't make a difference because the only thing that 's limits of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in your screen . It 's also a very flexize architecture .
This is a books , example of data not images .
This is the Dickens of Dickens . Ogn . Every colonna represent a capitable .
For shows you that it 's just a test of tells , we can do something like that , to do that it 's a real representation of a representation of the text , not a photos .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little bit of electronic .
It doesn 't want to be .
This is a more realistic . It 's a number of of the Look .
Every images , the beginning of a section .
And it 's going to you to have the pleasure of the version of a chart of a review of a five-view of a quotidian , which is for nature a molecule of a half of a half of a half .
We also did something with the angle of this number of this particular number of the Look .
We 've created a fasull to a fasules , much more than that is because in a normal published , and we 've inserious -- and we 've inserious contained .
If you want to see the careful of this authomobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even specific specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We 're going to be able to put up in the pop-up and other dow-up and other down-similar pounds , I don 't have to be necessarily .
And of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't know , we 've also realized that we also have to give it in this camp .
These are all the streets in the USA soverties a geospacal image of NASA .
So we 're going to be at all .
This now is effectively from the web ; you can see it .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research a very interesting research from Noah Snavah Snavity , a student of the University of the University of the U.S. Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve . " Okelisi Microsoft Research . "
And it 's from the Web , gests from Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from a picture to the other and have this kind of extremendous solution .
But the space space space of the space here has effectively .
The algorites of the computer have recorded these images together , in a way that we have these images together , in a way that I 'm sitting to the place that -- all the wait on the Montaghi Rocococcurred on Montaghi Rocococococcurred . So , you know , the elements of the elected . So , the elements are all colleags . So , these are all the space space .
I don 't know if I 've got time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to spend up to one of the original data , of Noahy-prototype of Phototype of Phototype that we 've done works for the first time the last last time the extremely clear . And it 's not necessarily clear . And it 's not necessarily look at the environments that we 've been looking at the website . And it 's not necessarily looking at the web .
We 've had to worry about the laws and forth and forth .
This is a rebuild the rebuild the Notre Lame 's taken by Flickr . Bast Flickr , in Flickr and you get images of the fields of the fields , other campus , other campair and forth and forth . On the wind of these connects .
So , they 're all images , from Flickr and they 're all colleaged to the space in this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this way .
You know , you know , I would never think about end to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratificant to remember this kind of across here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of kinds of kinds of photocameras , from those phones of the professional phones in the professional , a number of meaning , they 're doing together in this environment .
And if you can , I try to try to try to look at those most strange .
A lot of them are block , etc .
You know , some part of a photographs -- old it 's a series of photographs .
This is a poster of Notre Dame recorrectly .
We can go from the poster to the vision of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social . This now is taking data from the intermemory -- from the intermemory , from the intermemory , from the point of visual visual visual , and college all those data together .
All photographs are colleaged together , most of the parts .
You have a term model of the land that emerging .
You think about this as a proling of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grows up in complexity , and the people that are using it , and the vantages for the cleaning with the use .
Those pictures are hushed with metads .
If somebody 's got the idea of the idea of those saying out of all these saying the name , my photographs of Notre Dame , and I can use all the data , and I can use as a point of all data , and I can use as a point of engining in the space , using the space of the photographs of everybody else , and have a cle-mo-mo-mo-mo-mo-mo-like cuser .
And of course , a consequence of all this are virtual models of all the interesting model of the land , collects of the land , collects of the Earth , you know , not just to be awards , but from the memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software you to do is that you 're going to do is that a certain point , in the next years , all the photographs , all the photographs , all the photographs in the world will be across ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is in practice .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the base of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the rich of the security of the security of these images .
As when you do a research of images on the web , you digits a frase and the text of the web has a lot of information about pictures .
Now , what if you do is that you have to get all your pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of semantics and the amount of rich is really huge . It 's a classical classical classic .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible .
BAA : I 'm very much .
One of the main piaces , when you travels and one of the research of the etnographics is the power of who has no forforget in the past , between the anti-for-traditions , between the past , the wind of the ployed , driven by the floating , dying , drives the floor of the piece of the piece of the piece of the piece .
Basti think that sciamans Jaguar traveling even even even the Via Lattea , or that the model of the Inuit are still colors , or in Himalayas , the good thing that in Himalayas , the idea of Dharm , to remember the important thing that we live in the most important thing , but it 's idea that we live in the world 's idea , but it 's just a sense , it 's just a sense ,
The consequence of a particular scels that our standle stops that our strops has done , well , many generations ago .
And of course , we all share of tracts .
We all have . We all have . We 're going to be .
We 're suggests to the beginning .
We have to furate the inesorability of death , so it doesn 't surprise if we cancer and ballie .
We all have a art .
What colors is the particular of the song , the dance of the song , the dance of every culture .
Not improve , the ink of the Borneo , or the following of the Haiti , or the Haiti , or the drives of the Kaisut in Kaisut , Curnenya , or a Curnahara , or a cameras in the heart of Sahara .
He was my bad in the desert of journey in the desert of the Comolanger in the Colangm , on the Everest , the demand the mother of the world .
All of these populations us that there are other ways of existing to existing other ways of thinking , other ways of the world .
And if you reflect a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
And together , the miriades of cultures of the world creating a spiritual life and cultual that we wanted the planet and cultural cultual that we wanted to have the planet as the planet as biosphere .
And you can think about this record cultural as a cultural etnosfic , and you can defining the som of all the concepts , sometimes , teaching , teaching , intuitions , inspiations , inspiations , intuitiitions , inspiration , intuitions ,
The etnosfera is the patrimonium of human .
It 's the symboll of what we are and what we can be in how much species .
And because the biosphere was free consumed to be a lot of it was very fast to the etnosfera and too much much more rapidly .
Noooogist , for example , it would that 50 percent of all the species was or is about the extinction of the extinction , or the most apowerful , or the most apowerful -- in the most of the biological camp -- and you don 't even even even even even even though the poorest in the power of cultural countries .
The intells all this is , of course , the loss of language .
When you were 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only by a vocabolary or a series of rules .
A language is the spraper of the human spirit .
It 's the middle with the animal of every culture is in the world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a bacteria , a thought , a spiritual ecosystem .
And those 6,000 languages , as we 're seduts here at Monterey , at least half is not more surrunning in the oreckles .
They 're not teached to children , which means , that it wants to say , at least something , which are already dead .
What 's the longer than being fly from the silence , the last to talk about a language , the last to talk about a language , not how to transmitting the sagges of the ancipate or to ancipate the children ?
This horring is the state of someone in the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a motor and bring with a snail and bring with the ull ull the ull ularly syllabs .
And I know somebody to tell you , " Is it not better ?
The world would not be a better place if we 're going to go through all the same language ? " Well , then we talk about yorba . We 're talking about meaning .
We 're talking about .
You 're going to be a tract of what it means is not to talk about the language .
Today , I would like to do a vision through the church .
a little journey in the etnosfera for a bunch of what we 're lost .
A lot of us to forget that when I say , " different ways of existing existing existing .
We can make for example this bimber Barasin Amazonia , the sector , the popular , which creds to the souldn 't be creding by the lats of the swest bunacred of the swest sunaces .
It 's a popular popular popular color that is not distinguy the blue is identified in the time , which is identified in the time , which depends the popular popular .
They have a strange language and a rule , detect , " exament , " exogamia , " you have to spoke a person who talks about a different language .
This is radical in the past past , yet the particularity is that in these families in these families where you talk about six or seven language of multi-cause cause of matrimons , no practices no practices .
They 're limited to listening and then start to talk about .
We can take one of the most interesting tribes with which I lived , the Waoran Ecuador , the Waoran Ecuador incredible popular , a popular popular , which has been contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionaries have tented a contact with a herror .
They did by the alphotographs that were rying them in pose that were used to be in pose that , and forest that this popular popular , which was not seen anything about whatever .
They 've been told the ground of the earth , they turned to the research of a challenge and , not find nothing , they 're going to be connected that they were killed to the slower , and they killed the five missionaries .
But the Waoran doesn 't just killed the straniesterday .
They killed between them .
The 54 percent of the mortality was caused by their own .
We 're sitting to eight generations and we found two morrow of morrow and when we 've been told to know , they have a lot of them was invected , and then they were told , and then they killed the same . [ [ As kyourself , and then they killed the same .
The clackers were able to recognize the animal urina , and recognize the species .
In the first years , ' 80s , I was assigned a very interesting when my professor of Harvard , I asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to Haiti and secret in the secret of the power of Duvalier and the Macoutes , and I can immed me to do the gacoutes , and impossitting me to do the zombiombiombiombiomer .
Touldn 't make a sense of it , I would have to understand the culture of Vodoo and that Vodoo is not magnern .
It 's a fairly of a complex meant of the world .
Thank you very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
We 're going to Islam , Budaism , Budaism , etc .
A continent is always leave out of the continent , thinking that Africa is not have a religious of religious . And instead of them . And instead of it . And instead of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of tragic tragic meeting .
What makes the voodoor is the voodoor is the intense of life and death .
So , you know , you know , you know .
And the spirits can be invest by Great Acqua , they respond to the dance of the dance and replace in the dance of vision , which is a shoring pattern of the vision that for a short became .
For this voodost , you know , you know , " You can go to talk about God .
We 're in the temple and divention . "
And from the moment that you 're sitting , it 's the spirit that you can do you like to do you in the mal ?
So you 're incredible events , you follow the voodoor in the state of transpent that touch a demonstration , a rather shows a rather extrends of the power when it 's catalized in the body of the power when it 's catalyzed in a state of extrends .
It was all the populations with the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary are the Kogi of Sierra Nevada , Santa Marta , in Colombirthy .
It 's going to be an ancivilization that once had a living on the planning of Colombia in atteses , the popull of the conquirt , the popular popull , the popular is to the craft .
In a drugs , this popular , this popular , this popular , it 's never conquire from the spages .
It 's now now now , they 're government by a clery , but their formation is , extraordinary .
The young people come up to the families to get from the families to three or four , and live secreated in a world fact of good world and homs in a world of base of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice for 18 years .
Two draw years of proposed to repected the nine of gestation that transrate in the user of the mother , now are metaphor , now are metaphor , now they 're metaforically in the Grande Mther .
So , this time , you get to accultural values of their society , values that their predict and just their predict to their predict and just their predict to get the cost of the equilibrief .
They 're sudden of this incredible beginning , they 're improvement , and the first time in their life , in the age of 18 years , you see an alba . And in that activity of the first cut of the first wrong , when the sole beautiful , when the soles of the beautiful beautiful , everything they learned in the tells . The preciate is in the predict of the beautiful . The predictending .
" I 'm going to say , " I said .
It 's study . Now it 's to you protect it . "
They call them , they call them , and they say that we , fratels , we 're the colputs of the world .
This is extremely important level is extremely important .
When we think about populations and injudly , we 're invote and the old old story of the noble self-self-self-self-self-became , which is a razy , or maybe we 're going to be closer to the Earth .
The populations are not not sental secal niture .
There 's no space for these things in the palures of the disease , or in the gelids of Tibet , but thank you , they created a mistics of the Earth , created a mistics of the Earth , but we 've created a mistics of the war is more subtwear . But the concept that the Earth can only be untile .
What does it mean ?
It 's going to say a guide of Ande that the Ande is a bunch of Apu that 's a spirit Apu that 's going to be a human destinly different destinly different and will have a lot of different report and will have a different report of Montana , and it 's going to be a little bit of Montana , which is a bunch of Montana .
That 's the dimine of one , or a mineral bunch is irrifying .
What 's interesting is metaphor that is the metaphor that is the metaphor and the natural world .
I grew up in the forest of Columbia Britannicked that the forest forests to be cut .
And what Hukukuk , I 've got a different of my friends Kwakiutl that are the forests of Hukukuk and the stort of the paradies of paradit and the spirits that live in the world , spirits that they live in the world , spirits that we 're going to be in the world .
If you start to look at these cultures can create different , you can start to understand some of their discoveries . We make some kind of sensitional discoveries . We make this plants .
I brought this picture to open in the Nororororororccienterally .
If some of you have heard of the ayahuasks , the most powerful sustained the most powerful sustained .
What makes a lot of the ayahuasks is not the potential macological macological macological composite . It 's composition . It 's composition from two elements .
It 's a late , this launching sleeping a series of a bunch of a bunch , harmine , slightly slightly hallucinogens .
You can take the solar plants is a fuel that alters a blue that alters a little bit the consciousness , but it 's misceled with a family of the coffee , the Psychotridis .
This plants are powerful powerful , very similar , very similar to the serotonin , methoxylyptamines .
If you ever see Yanomami , you will see the nass that they do from a different kind of a different species , anched contains methoxylyptamine .
You 're going to be on the nass , it 's a little bit like to be sparate from a fire sunts of dipints and return on a mare of electricity . It 's not creates a storsion of the reality .
I had often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who wake was psycheels , with his discovery of the fungy , with his discovery of the fungone-en-hallucinogens .
My tines my tines , you can 't get these triptamin , because if you 're done you can 't tell any of it . You can 't tell any of it .
It 's possible to be absumerely if you just just like it with other sustained with other such .
Now , this is the beautiful : the beautiful is , in this liana is in this liana , in the MAO , the same kind of need to be able to be the sad . The amazing question . The question is in 80,000 species of a piece of 80,000 species of piece of ploys , but if you 're combined , if you 're combined , but if you combined a version is summ to the sometimics ?
We use the great eusually eusually , that can be reve-herror , that can be revehering .
But if we ask to the Indians , they will tell us . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , 17 variety of ayahuasks , which distinguys are nectely in the forest , and our eyes would be recently .
If we ask them as they 're going to be tells their tells tells us , I thought I would like to understand , I didn 't know everything ? " I didn 't know everything . "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night of lun-running , a little bit of a different tunch .
And that 's not sleeps to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting to content the stami .
Now , [ [ applauses the problem is that also the ones of us that have heart populs are pitting in the pittoresholds , but in some way to reducts of the story of the respect of the story of the respect to our world , and even even even .
In fact , the 19th century , between 300 years , it 's not remember for its drives , and rather than the technologies , but rather as a stopped , and we 've been hunteens and we 've been used to be actently or acceptaced , and cultural world . Now the problem is not change the problem . Now , the problem is not the change .
All cultures through the secos have been involved in a dance for new possibility of life .
And the problem is not the technology .
The Indians have no stop stop , they don 't stop to be Sioux when they put out of a burch and free behind and burnail .
It 's not the change or technology that integrity of the etnosfera . It 's the power .
The domination of domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you know that these are not cultures to be in the world , you know .
They are creatures and dynamics , and dynamics , that 's an identific forces that will be even even though their adaptation .
My discovered in the patria of the patria of the patria of the Penan .
a popular popular , in the sud-asiat-asiats , a popular that has been lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to the servites on the reserve and reduction on the ress of the reverse , where you can see the ufied by the light-half Borneighborn , where we 're going to be a half a crap .
You can get the sly-holding snail with the sound .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are the disease that are come with the discovery of the gold .
If we 're on the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the during of the politics .
As you know the genocide , the physics of a popular popular , it 's condannocide , but the etnocide , the destruction of the stroyle , not only is conditions of a popular , but it 's not only conditions , because it 's part of the strategy of the development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet until you can 't understand the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in China , in the Cocinside the Tibet , from Lhasa with a young , but just came to Lhhasa young , but just came to Lhasa hasa young , but just came back to Lhasa .
6,000 monuments saces in polls and cenhysls .
1.2 million people killed the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical to Panchen Lama .
which means that it means that it was killed to the time of the Chinese .
I was saying with Santity . Santity during the diaspects that has taken the popular in Nepal .
It was a mother was impressoned and his colpattern was recognize .
It was brought to a cart of two nashes in the age of two years old under his gonna because it would not live without .
The surprised , which was put it in a field of reeducation .
A day has invercalculated a fashion a fashion Mao and , for this transgression , was mession , was mession , was mession to the works .
The Tibet can be insopurable , but it spirit , it 's inside of the popular , it 's from a present .
And then , all you reduce to a choice .
We want to live in the world world 's world 's going to be in the world , or we want to get the world policicromatic world ?
The great anthropologists , before he dimented , before he said that , in our greater , in our towards this vision of love world , not only see the intergamm of human imagination of human imagination of human imagination .
And it 's ubillion .
The Neolitics , which gives us the agriculture , which has done us to have a lot of sems , sustaining the poem of the saman of the saman of the cler , creating gerarchia , creating gerarchia , and we 're talking about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world has been 300 years .
So , whether you 're not going to suggests that we have the answers to all the challenge that we 're going to do in the millenny to come .
When these myriades of cultures in the world is asked what to say to be human , they say , they say with 10,000 voes .
And it 's in these rispokers that we 're all going to be the chance of what we are : a consciously knowledge , which has to have to make all the gardes and all the gars can field . And there are great ways of horders .
I brought this picture on the northern extremely , when I went to clear balthough I went to clear with the Inuit , and this man , " Olaya , he tells me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The government canads is not always been gentle with the Popolo and in the 1950s to stucbilists , we have to recognize them in colonies .
The grand-of this man refied to go .
The family , I teach for his life , he took them up up up all the arms , and all the record .
You know that Inuit doesn 't teach the Inuit doesn 't teach the fast ,
The paces of the sliterally were made of fish , they were made in the paper .
The grand-out of this man , you don 't put out of the artics or from the drugs .
It 's sleeping up , it 's calculated the pantales in the skin in in the hand . When you have defected , they 've been congelate , they 've been congelated , working on a lama .
He spring on the dots of this college , and when I came up , and when I came to solide , he killed a dog .
He washed the dog and created a bunch , with the cast , he created a sliter , has a bunch , has a bunch of bunch , bull the ball of caccine .
We want to talk about cavared with anything ? [ [ Resilience . And this , in different ways , in different ways , [ Applausi is the symbl of the world .
In the 1999 , the government countries has reached to Inuit to Inuit , the total control of a largest California and Texas a together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's a territory . We 're dependent . We all the resources of mineraries .
One splendid for example of how a nation-state can recognize with his popular .
And finally , I think it 's rather obvious , at least who was in these clear remote of the planet , makes it connected that are not not to be remote .
For somebody is house .
They represent sections of human imagination that are algone of the time . And for us all , the dreams of these kids , like the dreams of our children , becomes part of the cloud of the hope of the hope .
For finally , we 're going to National Geographic , we 're convinced that politicians will never be nothing .
We believe that polemies --
[ Applausi , but we believe that the stories can change the world , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Ogn our website . We 've got 35 million living .
156 countries transmitted our canal television .
Our realized by millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the etnosfhere to bring our public places from which is going to be wrong , and they 're going to be wrong , and hope , they 're hoping , habled to the reve----the-reve-hand-sea-to-seatch and multicultural world , and we have to find a world of a world , and we have to find a multiculticultural world .
where the sagges of all the populations can contributing to our well-being collate .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you 're going to be able to be able and I 'm going to give some of the colleages , in case not .
I want to start with what I call " the dogma dogma .
The doggen of what ?
The dogen coufficial of all society Western society . The dogma recently , " If we want to massive citizens . " The way to do is massive citizens . " The way to do it is massive liberty . "
The reason it 's , from a late , in fact that the freedom is in the fact that the freedom , it 's precious , essential , essential , essential , essential humans .
In the other is in fact that if we are libes , each of us can act for all that that maximies our well-being , without nothing that decided in our well-being , no one that decided in our name .
The way to massive freedom is massive to massive choice .
It 's choices people have , more liberation , and most of them is their liberty , most of the liberty , most of it is their wells .
This is so very foundly , it 's so very foundly in society that nobody would be to put it in the drug .
And it 's also propth in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what the progress has to be .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly .
I 'm a simple note to hinsea .
In my sometimes there are 175 conditive , without content the 10 variety of holive and the 12 aces , and the 12 aces high , which you can buy a number of conditions of conditive in the circummmmmmmmmmmulation .
Here 's what 's the sound .
You go to the electronics of electronics to buy a stereo , lector , lector , lepector , radio , legs .
And in this single negoties of electronics , there 's a big number of components .
We can realize six million of different combinations of the different combinations that there are in a only negoties .
You have to admit that 's tants .
Altrications . The world of the communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the telephone , you could get all the desive phone , path that were forned by mammer Bell .
It was re-re-hand , it was not buy .
One consequence of that , between the other , was that the telephone was never .
These are handed .
Now we have a variety of phones , especially between phones .
Here 's the cellular cell phones .
My favorite is in a half , the MP3 , tut the nass of nass , and fornellin the crowd , and foreignery .
If you don 't even saw it in the negoties under home , you 're bought to be .
And what 's going on is that people entering in the negoties in the negoal . And you know what it is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do .
So , in other life expects of the bears that are much more important than the same explosion of choices .
Assistence sanitary : not going on in the United States that you go from doctor and the doctor , what you have to do .
So , you wave from the doctor , and doctor says , " OK , we could do . As , you can do a , or B " A " A has these benefits bells and these bells " B bells these risks . What does it want to do ? "
You know , " Dottes , what would I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits , and these risks , and these benefits , and these benefits . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebecame , " Dottore if she was me , what would do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The result is called " autonomonomy of the malated , expression that it does a beautiful thing .
But actually , it 's not a post-site and the responsibility to take some of somebody knows that something , obvious , whatever it is , whatever knows -- and almost certainly , it 's not in the ideal condition to make decisions the right patient .
There 's a huge marketing of products drugs , direct people , and you know , if you think it doesn 't have any sense , because you think it doesn 't understand them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do it ?
The answer is that they want to doctor to ask them to make it a doctor for to change the remember .
So , what 's fundamental as we 've ever been a choice , is a choice , as you see in this visual visual view . " We don 't want to force their own sex . " We don 't want to be a more . " We don 't want to be a lot of identity .
And we can reinventing how many times we can get us .
The means that every morning , you have to decide that like to be .
It 's a spect of the family and matrimonium , a time , until I was almost for anyone , was that you know , it was that you know , and he was started to get the most price as possible .
The only truth was with who , not when you know , and not even what to do after .
And it 's all really , it 's really to play .
I 'm very intelligent students , and I do their 20 percent in less than a time .
And because they 're not because they 're sweet .
but why are they impensierites , I mean , I would say , " I should be not do that ? "
" I should be later ? I would think before I 'm going to think before the career ? "
They 're interrogative .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this implessy doesn 't completely completely the companies and not get a bel vote to my extremendous vote to my extremendous .
And they have to really do it . They 're really important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , as Carl , because the technology was allows us to work every day , every day , every day , every day , every day , by every day , trannol Randolph .
It was parently , there 's a corner , and I don 't tell any what the WiFi works .
I say , " I want to use it .
What means , this incredible freedom of choices we have to look at the work ? We 're going to keep , and if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our child played , with the cell phone , the Blackberry , the Blackberry , and the ntickly , on the gints of ginockarcrowd .
And even if I 'm all spent , every minute that we see our child , we 're also asking the particians , we 're also asking this called ? "
" I have to answer this email ? I had to abboth this literally ? "
And even when the answer is " no , all this makes the experience of the particians of the very different child 's very different than what was in other conditions .
So , from any part of the things , small things and great , things , things materials and large materials , life is a choice .
Once the world was this : Ovous , there were some possibility , but it was not a choice .
The world of today is this : The dilemma is , " That 's a positive , or negative ? "
The answer is Soul .
The slights are all , so I 'm going to talk about those negative .
All this choice two effects effects on people .
The first , paradosssession , is that produces instead of .
With options of the options of which choose to choose , becomes very difficult to do .
I want you to offer an example : a study study study , a flight fly .
A colleaged to have been access to the data of the Vantum of the function-deep society , with about a million clients of clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offers in more , the adesion of two percent .
With 50 percent of offering , there 's 10 percent in the adesions of adesions , when they 're disponable . Why ?
Because with 50 bours of the flower , it 's mality , it 's maleds , and choice is to be remainly remainly .
And I 'm questions , and I still asked , questions , and of course , I 'm going to questions , and of course , I 'm going to ask .
You know , you know , it doesn 't just that these workers are eating for cans , because they don 't have enough money , it also , it also , it also , it 's so ostics that allow the decision is that allowed the funding of the work .
It 's not talking about it , they 're losing to five dollars from the dator of work , which would be bad as a true to be true .
So the paralysis a consequence of having a bunch of hunsequence .
And I think that makes the world .
" And I finish , for the eternity : ketchup , senape or maionese ? "
You can just take the right decision , if it 's for the thirity , if it 's it ?
You don 't want to choose the cut , and you can even get the wrong conditive .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can have to get the paralysis , and do a choice , at the end , we 're at least as we would be in the result of how we would choose .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of condments that you wrote , if you buy a lot of it , is not perfect , it 's not perfect , it 's easy that would be better than the alternative . And what 's happening is that the alternative imagined the crazy crazy , and the rimption of the choice , and the rimption , and the rise ,
And when it was a good decision .
There are , more , it 's more easy , it 's easy to be dispileeping of the option of choice .
And also , there 's what economists call it constood .
Dan Gilbert has been very well as a lot of how the value that we 're going to do things with what we confrontiers .
In the rest , when there are many options , it 's easy to represent the carteristics of alternative scartative , and be less undreads of the option that you have .
Here 's an example . I 've got all those who are not in New York .
But it 's what you probably think .
There 's this cople to Hamptons .
A place of lushed .
It 's sleeping . Ottim . It 's all for them .
Not nothing . But what he thought is , " Well , disease , built , it 's Austroyed . "
" All my neighbors to Manhattan are . "
" I could talk about front of front to me . "
And I 'm going to two weeks , you know , every day -- every day -- every day -- the chance of parking where it wants .
The expensive opportunity to be the soddisfation for what we have , even when the choice was old .
And more options that we have to look at the more than we 're looking at , the more concerned to be meet .
Here 's another example .
This jobs us tells us us a lot of things .
We 're going to talk about the moment , and maybe of live lently .
But the most important point is that any choice , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
The things that we don 't choose to be active active that can make less attractive what we do .
I 'm going to be a swait .
I tried to my pleasing a new couple of jeans .
It 's almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were just to get them and bought them from besty , they were discovered , they were discovered , just after they were taken to a lot of times , they were going to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple when the old old old old , and I said , " I 'm going to give me a couple of jeans , this is my wrong . "
The comcomcompose said , " Look at the fit , easy , it relaxed ? "
Who wants with the cerniera or with the bottons ? " Stonewashed , " or " acidwashed , "
" Would you like strapped ? "
" Sott them want to give them a game , you know , " Ble ble -- " Continured to elenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenen
I was sitting , and after a little bit , and after a little bit I could say , " I want to say , " I want to say , " I want to know what it was , so for a hour , I used to get all the jeans , and then used to use the best paper , and then , the best painting , and the best painting of jeans , and I ever had .
It was the massive . It was the best . I had the best .
But I felt , I feel worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all the choice was that with all the choice were altations , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was going to expectation . I didn 't expect anything exceptional , when I was only a kind of , but when I saw a kind of 100 different , under a kind of , allow like you had to be perfect .
What I was buy , but I didn 't perfect .
And I was sitting with what I was sitting with what I was sitted in front of the expectations .
The add of options in the life of people don 't do that increasing the expectations that these have answer to the old of the options .
And this will be less sometimes , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing if you make it .
Because if I knew it , you know what I 'm talking about .
The truth of the truth of this .
" And he was better when he was the worst " The reason that was better when he was better when he was worse , he was that when he was worse was even even even even even to meet .
In the world , in the world we live -- opuls , industrialized citizens with the expectancy , the massive things are going to be hoping is that we can hope is that things are in the altzy .
You never have surprised to be surprised , because your wait , the mies are involved .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- that 's what you 're here -- is , " Basse , " Yes , you want . "
I mean -- I mean , I 'm going to say -- which is really spot and my wife is really study .
I won 't have to do better , I 'm not accounted .
But you get not always to be a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of the jeans , when you 're just like that , when you 're just that kind of jeans is that when you 're not to be subsides , and I said , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " Well , the answer is .
The world is the responsible . What could you do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a bunch of jeans , and you ask you who is the responsible , is altreatment , it 's the responsible , is allows you .
You 're going to do better .
With hundreds of variety , there are not swailable for the insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even if you get a result is , you know , you know , they 're sitting and date the colpatterns .
In the last years , the last years old is explose in the world .
I think a meaning factor , but important -- not the only , but important -- this is that I 'm depression of depression is that the experiences are too high .
And when they need to explain this situation is their colpattern is their colpattern is .
So the end end is that we 're better better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the doggen , what we all take for good and it is completely falready . It 's completely falready .
There 's no bunch of a little bit of choice is better than not to have a little bit better than that you don 't have to sell it , but it 's not a little bit more than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been superperfored by a piece of the level where we do do our life .
Now , from the political point -- I 've been finished -- from the political point , the nocycle is the following is the following is the following .
What you allow all this choice in industrial society is the rich material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that it 's a choice .
The problem is that they too much .
So , what I 'm talking about is a disease of the modern of modern , remember society .
And what does deprimate and arring is this : Steve Levitt talked about how those expensive and discovered discovered and discovered discovered . It 's a sprups . It 's a spring of money .
I mean these choices , complicated and dispency , it 's not just inuseful .
They 're adtells of the purcheck .
They do it .
If a little bit of what in our society allows that was reversed in those where people have too much as much as well as well as well as well as well as well , but also , even even though we can 't just be the best of their life .
This is what economists called a better pareting pareting .
A redistributtion of the redried redriven , not only to the poor -- because of this choice in excepten that we go back .
Father , " Fanch , you can get everything that you want to be everything that you want ,
You know , you know , you think , " What 's what creds this fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get to a bunch of wind . "
" United States , a limited vision , a limited vision of the world -- "
And I 've been interpreted so , at the beginning .
But then , I realized , instead , I realized that fish .
Because the reality of fact is that if you eat , it 's because it 's all possible , " all of it is possible , " You don 't get the liberty . You don 't get the paralysis .
If you take the bocks in the way that all divents can diminulies .
You get the paralysis , and you reduced the well-being .
All of them need a free .
This is almost certainly too much , maybe even for the fish , and sure for sure .
But the asn 't a bunch of a bunch of burn inficity and , we 're texh for the rovine .
Thank you very much .
