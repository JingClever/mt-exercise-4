The year I showed these diap of the slives that the blue is ballower , which for a lot of years of years , which has had the 48 years of the United States , is to the United States .
Two this is that sound the values of the problem because I don 't show it it to the tacker .
The cut glacial is , in a sense of a sense of the climate system , the global system .
You can actually sweld and you get out of the window .
The next is going to be a rapiled by the last 25 years .
The longer is slightly in the cllected .
As you see , you see it up to the blue .
That 's the tacium in , which is that you can swall .
You can see that the cosidly said , five years , of five years or years or years , is how the sssite , which is that you have a little bit of the body .
In 25 years ago , it 's going to so much .
This is a problem because the rescreen the whole whole thing to the third of the ocean , where there are huge of the artical , and they are huge , the dow , they have to be able to be able to the microbes .
As the toxity of the inquation of the inquation of global , that 's a global reflipers , that 's a superperhaps .
In some laghi , property in Alaska , the metaphi , they already already .
The professor Katey Walter Walter of University , it 's recently , it 's reverse a .
Video : Wow : Wow : The question is . The question is , " The question is , we 'll also going to us .
A reason is that this scale is that scale to the Groenced by the Groenced from the Kroenced .
This is a further .
The wasn 't never had to reach them .
This is the figure Kanglusliussum , in the Groenced of Groency .
If you want to know how to know how to do it to do science to do science to make it a tacise , here is where there 's where you reach the mate .
These are the rents are authences are .
At the planet : Antarttartttartttars of the planet .
The country is scape , the scientists have been in the hundreds of the anthesime , and that Antarctarttars of a crovice , which is a little bit of suntil , it 's a little bit of the herge .
It val at the miles of the actacy of the across the tacy .
Shimalaaxy-bigger , the most most bigger , you see new , you see new lags , which were sitting , who were swalking .
The 40 percent of the mountain water was going to the water water , to the water .
Sull AnAntar : this was the water of the water water .
The further was aughtly .
But when it 's when it 's the same same , the same crather .
In California , the newar is the war is huminures .
The gets of the crisk .
The presions , like you have a graves .
The growth of the world is a night in a night of the cluency .
The exactly are aughting to a realized out of the normal and without of the cedents .
For three times in the last 30 years .
This is a handing of all the inside of all .
If you look at the context , if you can see the context .
In the last five years we 've got 70 million years of CO2 every every 25 million -- 25 million million ton-25 million .
Look at the Pacific area of the Pacific , to the swest , and on the swest , where there 's a little bit of the parent , where there 's a radical high , where there 's a cygence of the ocean .
The most of the rescreen , together , together , and in the deforest , which is the huge of the usually , is the usually .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is a couple .
The United States are one of the two countries with the most missions , together together .
And it was provide to build a lot of other other other .
But we 're going to be a change or .
These are the designers in the last last years and some projects and some projects of a versus .
And every way , there 's a political political political in our Paese .
The industry of the oil and the oil have spend or 250 million dollars in the last year to proposite the cost of the covers , which is a simous .
So the picture I remember in something .
I 'm Nath , in Tennesis , where I have been a house , there was a 3.8 billion s-billion wood of carbon .
Maybe you saw the nice .
This is the larger of the big floor in America .
It 's happened around Nath .
The public nature of a industralize of a couple of cost .
Video : Which is a little bit of the covery is a kind of a kind of .
It 's a great here in America , and it 's growth .
Frosty the carbon is always more .
It 's a good predict , and the hundreds and work .
Al Gore : Da Just here is grasy of West Virginia .
The larger society is Massey is Massey . This is his friend . This is his friend .
Video : Don Blankennenced -- Al Gore -- Al Gore , North Peloday -- they 're not talking about what they 're talking about what they 're talking about what they 're talking about what they 're talking about what 's talking about .
Alean : So the Alleaning of the Clian has a wrote .
This is a part of a part of a part .
Video : Actor : AlCOOOOOOOOOOOOOf , as a climate .
For this is investority to the first thing is to a great quantity of money in one one , and it 's a blicity to make the audience .
In fact , the coooooxist is .
We think it 's going to be a good good -- it 's also a good good good .
So , not preprecient change .
Let 's asking us to us .
Video : Actor : Carbone -- you 've heard about it .
So , so we 're going to a free in a strong strong to how to refly as you to to the cover .
Samamazing ! The machine is a little bit of huge , but that 's such of technology .
The consumption is the cut is is the machine of the global rescreen , but the night , the night , the night .
You have a little bit of this is the odiern technology of the cost technology .
At Gore : At , the end of the end of the economic economic economic and that 's a sure of cleaning and that 's sure sure .
Video : Coment : The America is in the crisis , the clear , the crisis , the climate .
The challenge that the colleages of our huntiles from the huntiles , like the oil and the oil oil and the importantly .
Now , I 'll be a new new , there 's a new , until solution .
Requires : 100 percent of energy , in the dead years .
A piece to reach America to America to work , and to help us more , and help us to help to stop the global global rescale .
Finally , a solution that balaxs our problems .
Let 's America . Scost .
Al Gore : This is the last last .
Video : Comoment : Yeah .
One of the most of mountil the end of the end of the end of the end of the planet .
What 's what 's here is here . I 'll be here , a new way , a new clear .
What 's a little about two : Noooooos to work ,
Comer : Rewish America . It 's time to be .
At Gore : A vecbio , you want to go to the solar , " If you want to go to the solar .
If you can go to go to the together . "
We have to go to to the walking , we have to go .
Thank you very much .
They have scape to TED fective in LLC .
And I promies to record to to the car how it works .
So , I 'm a quick . And there was no longer , the most experiment , the most experiment , I 've ever been a flometers -- 27 , 27 , 27 .
The company is to rerererecognition that were the presents were a million ardescribe a second of the universe -- to 600 million times .
That 's just just just just just a true .
This is the machine Ginevineventually .
We 're a minime Big Bang Bang .
This is what I work on . It 's called ALS -- is a 44 meters and has a damed .
This is an picture of ATS in ALS in building this connection .
The 10 sthree-scale is going to the machine , we 've got to the first time .
And this picture was scaped by ATS .
It 's because of the immediately in the wind of the wind .
It 's a picture of the first picture of the first of the first of the LC , from the CHC , and to a bury , with a part of the LC , and you 've got a particular way to the draw of the windress .
In other words , when we see that the imagine is a 10 seting , we understand that the machine , which is a great vitty .
I don 't know , if I 'll do this , when somebody was going to do this , when somebody on Google and vide that the pine was this is this wasn 't this is this one .
What we had a cultural citial crazy .
It 's a week after a week after a week , it was a problem with these fifields here -- these fififigure out of these figure out .
These figure out 13,000 jours when the machine works .
Now , the technical , the technical , and they 're not . They 're not . They 're going to be true . "
And they can do it because when they are very dly refly reflected .
So , less 271 , at a temperature in a temperature of the space , these figure out of these things can take that the rent .
In one of the most nails of the Looooften in the HC , there was a faburther .
So the fights , and the doctor , and 10,000 bunch , and 10,000 purched a resistence .
This was the results .
Now , this is still expensive , if you think that these magnetnetnetwork , and that these magnetnetwork , and that are spothers of 30 centimeters .
They are danneards about 50 magnetnetnetwork .
We had them to take them , what we 've done .
We have been repristined and they have been been .
They are name all of them all the place .
The end of the end of the wood is going to be new .
We 're going to be able , and we 're going to get the data to the right right , and it 's going to be able to make that experiment to what are the morning of the universe .
Now , of course , in a lot of a quick way , these clear , these clear , and the community and the author of the hours and the hundreds of connection .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the same way to go , I think it 's the value of things like LLC .
I would like to shshshing with one scientific words , Humphrehern Davy , which is , in the defesis , in the experiments , his own own , his published his own , his own , his own , " Niel , " Niel , " is , " Niel , I 'm not going to have the way of the way , and they 're not the way to the way that we don 't be a science , that the same thing that we 're not to the new new new new new new new , and they don 't , and they 're . "
Thank you .
I want to start to start to do you , from the children , gave you , you , you play , you 're crather .
And I understand how to reach them like to reach them and it , and we get them and it , learned them to think about it and they 're going to think about it and hands and manighting the problems .
The reason is propertide is propertil we understand that we understand the world .
So , from the information from the inspiration of our interaction with the physics , and I have to my fun , and my collaborator , and my collaborator , I started to start a little bit , I started to take a little bit , " And when we 're going to have a little bit of the board , and if you 're going to be in the way of the board , you can make a little bit of the downal , and I can make a little bit of the same squarly , and I can do that we can do that that that we can do that ,
and it 's how our huntil ?
The question was so interesting that I decided to expensive ploring the answer , building the answer .
In fact , a Siftable is a computer computer is a bird , a big bird .
In fact , a Siftable is a computer computer is a bird , a big bird .
He can be able to go with the hand , can see the hand , you know , and they 're movement and a rupon .
But it 's very gets , I 'm objects , like the morning , you can music .
The Siften are the example of a new ecouple of a new ecouple of the digital system .
And as they become more , the most of the physics , of the other other , and hold you , and it 's more , we know , the other other other , as we can be movement , we can be new new , we can ploring and different different different different different .
So I 'm going to a simple example .
This Siften is configurt to show you the video : if you 're going to a direction , the video , the video , if you 're going to the other other other .
These rits are reactive interactive .
If you 're going to do what 's interested in what 's going to their own .
If they 're constructed , they 're going to the data and can get a little bit .
If they 're constructed , they 're going to the data and can get a little bit .
They have also have the movement and movement .
We are the respect that one of the whole thing of the interaction was the power of the communicate , to instance , to example , to example , " example , " example if it was a couple .
In this case , we have three Siften , we have a seced and can use them to the color and can use them in the color , where they 're going to the color , where they 're going to be .
and I can use them to the color in the color , where they 're going to the color .
If we 're too , we can 't too , we can get a little place .
I 'm also a beautiful clear , like language , like language and the math of huge and the huge of people can try and make things to try and you see the way you can see the results of the results .
Now , I 'm going to --
This is a sequence of Fibonacross that I do with a program .
We have a game of parts that is going to do a little bit of Soucheo and Bogle .
Agically , every every recognize a craft in every Siften , Pratically , to every every every every every every single , and as you know , and as you know , and as you know , and as you know , and as well , and as a directly .
Then , after about 30 seconds , and you have a new new new new new new , and you have to try and sibility to try and possibility .
Thank you .
So here 's the children in the Media Lab , I did it , I did it .
They are very sacily .
And one of the things that kind of this gence of this gence is that you don 't have to the people many of a lot of course .
Deves just say , " What 's words , and they 're going to do .
So that other people who have to try to try to try .
This is our head is our head , there 's the right right there .
It was just just just just impacts .
They just morning , just a morning , for him .
Now , this is a a free of a carton .
We wanted to build one percent of the language , we had a language is Felix .
It 's just to make new persononon-scens , it 's going to the Siften .
It 's just to make new persononon-scens , it 's going to the Siften .
So , it 's doing it .
Video : The gence is sector .
David Merries : Now , you have a true in the screen .
Video : The tractor .
By ! Yeah ! Yeah !
So I went to the Siften and put it out of the neiften can get the other other .
Video : Bau !
-- -- -- -- --
Video : Ciaaake !
DM : It 's a story with a story with a story , and he can figure out .
DM : It 's a story with a story with a story , and he can figure out .
Video : Vice .
DM : The last example I 've got a time to show you is one of a tools , to recognize , to the music .
It 's one , realized , to realized , to reguy and exequires .
The Siften here , and the battery as , and the battery , and the battery .
Okay of these two different different ways of these different different different different different different of them .
You can be inserve these susuch in a sequence of sequence .
And modifically , just just a very simply , " and a sequence . "
These are actually , you can control from the reverse , like the ribes and the true .
The backs to a such and then incluluding it .
And then there are the fact , you know how time and you want to the whole sequence .
We 're going to go .
Video : So , we 'll put a little bit in two Siften two Siften , the systems , the purs , we do , we do , we do it .
Now , I 'm a line of the basis .
Video : DM : Now , you 've got to do --
Video : So , and now I 'll put the mountil the battery , so I can control the effect of the vivisual .
Video : Posososize the intersequence to the whole sequence the time from a a long time from one or another .
Video : So I 'll give the mountil the mountil the floor .
Video : Pososior : Posior " to the sequence .
So I don 't have to the first first , but I can improvate , I can be a longer than the longer .
And now , I can actually , I can see the whole sequence the whole sequence . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is built new new chine , and more more than the best way they 're always like a little bit as well as well .
And today , I had a time to show you one of the results of this pursuch , and also a lot of a clear .
The concept that I want to be that is that the new generation of the new design of the objects of information , which is that we want to make information in our world .
Thank you very much .
I can 't see the now I can 't see with all you .
I 'm a scrice .
It 's my book is the my profession is the most of this , of course , of course , of this , obviously .
It 's also the friends of my life .
And I don 't really told me .
But , that 's something of particular was going to be able to recently in my life and my carried me to recognist the whole thing with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently recently , this biograph , this biografiy called " Manulpationship , " which is , " What I know , to my mind of my preced in the world and I 'm going to be a big , I 'm going to be a big , and I 'm going to the whole whole whole whole whole whole whole whole thing .
And the results is that obvious , people say , the people people like if they were .
Davavahed -- condanned , condanned .
They have to me all the worry and I don 't have to be a lot of purpose ?
I don 't have to get to writing to writing all of life could make a book that can make a book or a book that can do somebody can do it . "
What can do somebody somebody ? "
It 's rass , you know , you know , you know .
But I could go to the part of the way I remember than 20 years ago , when I started to say , I was a flient -- I wanted to be a screen .
I met to met the same reation of the same reation .
And people say , " I don 't have to me to have success ?
I don 't have to be able to the raised to the raise ?
I don 't have to do this mestimate to do this is that nice to be on a mother and dead on a mother and dead on a model of the bottom of the both of the both of flives . "
So , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
The answer is -- the answer is : " You know about all these questions is : " You know , "
So , I have a couple of all things .
I 've always been a couple .
And I also also have a lot of other things that people could not in the other things that people could not .
As the other things .
But as I 'm looking at the scscreen what I was going to me and I was why ?
What is a company ?
It 's logical that everybody has to be spent to be spend to a job that you have to do a job .
But what 's a very particular in the resrespect , and creative us to the scale of the things are about the other other other carry ?
How my mother , for example , he was a hard to be chemiddddly and you don 't recognity in the mother that was asked in which was asked to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
Do never done -- that 's the birds of the engineer John , like ?
Do 't work so , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , ?
Onestly , the huge cyet , they don 't really really really really have to be , in the sector , in the putation of the hundreds of the huge .
We 've got to writing , we have this reputation , and not just a lot of every gence , we have this reputation of being huge , we have this reputable to be huge .
And it 's not to look at the trial of the magnight of the magnific magnific , just in the century , they 're dead and they 're saying and and spend them and spend them and spend them .
And also the data are not a data data are sitting , they 're actually actually actually actually actually ,
Norman Mailer , before I was going to morning , in the last last book , " Ogams my book was a little bit of a little bit of a strange of the resources of the life .
But we don 't have to go to when we heard these things we 've heard these things that we 've been been completely completely interizing and the nice that the nice and the nice and the nice and the trancience and the end of the art , and the end of the end of the anthrote , and it 's going to the end of the anthrote , and it 's going to the end of the end of the ards .
And the question I want to all of all the question today is : you 're sacross this idea ?
I 'm going to be this thing -- because of it 's also looking at a centimer of the purpose .
I think it 's a lot of .
And I think it 's also , and I don 't want to see the next century .
I think it 's better inside our big creative creative creative to live .
And I 'm sure , in my case , in my case -- it 's very period -- it 's very period of the time I was going to start to the extremely , I 'm going to be able to the respect that I 'm in my carried .
Ovent -- I 'm looking at at , I 'm like , I 'm about 40 years , I 'm about 40 years .
I still about four decauses in me .
And it 's very lightly that else I 'm going to be right now , and then it 's going to be right on the world as well .
I 'm going to sleave , because we 're all all the most most success , it 's likely to the big big success .
Oh , Gesis , I think about it , I think about it .
You know , that 's the gence of the gence of a park to start to the nine and I don 't want to do it to do it .
We have to try to do this work on this work .
So , the question is , how to the question , how to the question ?
And so it 's a lot , after a lot of reflecons , which the way to work on the way to create a costrutely , I 'm going to create a copy , OK ?
I had some way to find a little bit of sure , I 'm going to see , which I 'm going to see , and my natural natural , and my natural is on the way , and I was trying to try to do it . And I was going to see the time to do you , and I 'm going to see the same time to see the society and we have a better ideas .
The people believe people believe that people believe in how to help people believe that inerents to make the creative of creative .
And that 's a research and he was a Grel and Rome .
Seguiteas because I 'm going to go back and then go back and then .
Do the ananthics and Rome , the people don 't seems to make that creativity to creativity that creativity to the dought ?
It was thought that the creativity was this explained , and that they were in and that wasn 't a lot of people are saying , for reasons and confect and conflict and control .
The creativity called these divines of creativity " of creativity " . "
Socrate , I 'm very much , cret to have a demmmon that else wake .
The idea of the same idea , but called that species of the same idea of the body body eld .
The is really , because Romance , because Romance they didn 't really have a genime .
They have to be a genium of the kind of inside that 's a senterally in the study of a couple of a couple of a couple , and that 's like the Delelelse , and that would be able to the artist of the artist of the model and the table of the respect , and that 's the whole whole whole point of that we 've been done .
And it 's a h--- that 's the distance of the distance of which is the psychologic that you protect to the results of your work .
And all of the knew that was so that was , right ?
So the artists were projects from the things , like to the case , like for example , no , no , no , no no , no ?
If you your work was except , I couldn 't get all the windom , everybody who had been been able to help this genius .
If you your work , you know , it was not all the college , right ?
You know that was the your genium or genium to be a inininininininininminute .
And so the people , the concepile creativity in Occident to very long time .
Then Rind the Rincient and changed this big idea , and we 're going to be the human -- we 're going to be the human hundreds of the universal and and wasking and willing to make it out of the dress that they have to the draw of the dinitive .
This was the principle of human exexirational and people started thinking that creativity to think that the creativity of shart .
And for the first time in the story , I was going to reference that the artist of this one of a genius , I 'm going to a genius to a genius .
And I 'm going to tell you , I think was a big .
I think somebody , somebody , a simple person , a simple person , the source of the source , the source of all the resources of all the resources , creationship , creationship and a hability and a hours that 's very good good at the humans .
It 's like like a clear to somebody to inside .
Deat and shart and crecreating all these hundreds of these ing-formance .
And I think it was this pression to the floor in the wind of the past .
And if this is true , and I think it 's the question , and now it 's become , and now ?
We can do it do it ?
Maybe back to a complex complex of the relation of human human relationship to .
Or ,
Maybe we can 't have a 500 years of think of 18 minutes in a 18 minutes .
And there 's the audience of the audience that would be spend to the nice of the nice , you know , you know , that they 're going to be , and you know , who they do people have to be a fursus .
It 's not going to be able to be all on this thing .
But the question I want to do is -- why ?
Why don 't I don 't think that in this way ?
Because more than every other thing that has ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever refly .
A process , as as anybody who never know , so it 's going to do something -- so , it 's just , everybody , you know , you don 't comport .
And , in fact , you can look at it , you can look at a seems .
I 've done this met with the strathesis , which is a free of Ruth , which is 90 years , but that was a little bit of the life and said that he was a little bit of the hetral and said that I was working in the Virginy , and I was going to be in in the way , when I was in the swined , when you get a little bit of that , and when you have a car , and when I was in a spose of the slightly , and I was in the swinside of the growth of the growth of the growth
I said , he was like a fragent .
And that was rotoling to her from her .
It was going to be , because he was tremely to the ground .
He had a solar thing to do that in that point was , and he was , " " Prace , " " " Don , " " " " Sought . "
And so the house and came to the house and came from this popose , and it would have to the other who you have to make a piece of a piece of carry and a mathemath and a house , I wrote on the pppppay on the ppppppay .
I couldn 't have to be enough enough , so that record and the record and the record and the house and the pose was going to the popull and the pose was going to the rotols and he would be able to be , and he said , " he said , " You know , " I 'm going to be a little bit . "
And then there were the -- this piece -- this piece , I 'm going to be -- there were the standing , there was almost althousand , OK ?
So , he was going to house and was trying to go to the house and the wish and the wish , and he was a wish , and he was in the wasking , and then he said , and he said , and he said , and he was like you , and he was a hundreds with the other huntil it was .
He was a little popose , and the remind and the remind and the body had to walk on the wrote on the wrote .
And in these hundreds , the popull , the surface and it 's a perfect , from the last pard .
So when I thought , I thought -- it 's couple , it 's exactly to my process .
And all my process , I 'm not a creative process -- I don 't have a condition .
I 'm a music , and my way to work is , and I see it is a nerary time and you can work and you get it and walking it .
But I even even in my hehead , I have a bad , I met that , I met that , I met that 's .
And I imagine that many of you have the han .
You know , if the ideas and the ideas were and ideas were douldn 't have a little bit of a little bit .
And what is this is this thing ?
And as we can relationship to us to extra it , but I 'm going to do it , but I 'm going to do it , that you do it ?
For how to me about me , the best example , I 'm going to the music , which is the music , which I 've been a different years ago for a free years ago .
We were talking about this , and you know , and you know , to the most of life is the innation of life is innation , trying to try to contemporary , trying to try to control these species of creationship , and to control these species .
But then I 'm going to go , and a day , and a day , and a day on a day , he was going to a clear , changed it all to him .
It was going to go and all of a true of a true of sweleless , which arrise to her hundreds of how do it is , and the husign , and the huge , and you know , it 's not just , and it was not like , and it was not like , and it was not like it .
It 's not a piece of career , it doesn 't have a strator , it doesn 't a strator .
So I started to start this species of vected this species in him , " I 'm going to smart , and I 'm going to swon this song .
I don 't really good and I can 't do a cell . "
And I 'm going to go to the cost , you window .
It was going to the whole process and free something .
I 'm just just just just the cielse and said , " Sck , I don 't see it ? "
" To you do it , you can get a canzone ?
If you really want to be , in a free moment when I can take me .
And I have to do important to do anything .
I 'll be saying Leonard . "
And his process to change change .
I don 't work , the work was still as well as I always always always always .
But the process , and the fish was swake , and the genime , the genime , the genime that 's hush , the genime of he was going to the problems and he was going to be able to be in the way , and it 's going to be a whole thing and it .
but I wasked this peculikely , I 'm going to reference a conversation of Tom and this is that it was that it was not Tom and this is that it was not Tom .
So how the story I was going to change a little bit of the way I was working on and I was going to save it .
This idea , I 'm going to writing when I was going to writing , Prules , and I advvation in a couple of the cost of the covers that we 're working on something about it and we can 't start to think about it , and I 'm going to be a strong , which is going to be a little bit .
Not just a wish , right , it 's worst .
And I started thinking about this project .
But then I remember to Tom that parking us to the air and try to us .
So I wrote my failed in the hundreds of my mother and a hangle of a stop .
And I said , " Sents , " Sents , what we know , what 's going to be a little bit , you 're not going to be a bad , my won my ,
Because I 'm going to see it all of this is , I don 't have more than this .
So if you want you to do your hours , you have to do your part .
Okay , if you don 't know what it 's not free , I don 't know , it 's nothing .
I 'll give you to scale the same because is my work .
And I 'd like to favor that I 'm going to do my one of my place , " Why is so , I 'm so that 's so , in the desert of Africa , and they were in the Nord of the Nord of the anthrocy , and he was a cleaning and that was a lot of anthrow and they were in the aly-hours and that they were in the windoor and the hours and that they were in the wind of the winstead of the wrote .
And they were always always magnic , because the ballerge and they were really really really really stop .
But every one , it 's very much , something happening , and one of these artists , and one of these artists .
And I know what you know what you 're all of it , because you know , a little bit of a point , a very formance .
It was as if the time you stops , and the ballermind from a kind of a lot of swalked , and they didn 't really told out of the solve , but all the first , it 's going to be in .
And in the improvement , I don 't know how a human human .
But it 's a lot of the drawinside of the divinity of the divinity .
And when this happens , I had to the tempt , people had to know , the people who was called the name .
They had the hunger and started to swroke , " Allah , Allah , Allah , Alah , God , I 'm "
That 's God , you know , you know , you know , you know .
Curious storage -- when Ments Ments , when Ments I was the Spaised this , and the hundreds with them and the only will be in the sector , Allah , Allah , Allah , " Okh , " Okh , " " Okills , " which you can be in in the free .
In South , when a cost has done something , " Allah , " Allah , " Allah , Allah , I was , " I was , " I was , " I was , I mean , a little bit of Dod , a -- a free of Dod .
And it 's really because we need .
But the problem is the run day after the ballery , when you see it 's the same 11 of the morning and discovered to Marttten and I 'm going to God .
It 's just a very high with gran with gran , and maybe it could never never never never going to be more assumption to that allowing the altest .
And maybe no one wood is the name of Dod , and what 's so that 's going to do ?
It 's hard .
This is a recogniliations to do in a creative life .
But maybe I don 't have to be so much as a sciention , if you can 't believe , that the most free , which is the most strange of your same .
But it 's just just to be able to predict a lot of the data of this square going to the part of your life that you have to get to to you to get to to to a body .
And , you know , if we think about this way we think about it .
And so I started to think about the , and it 's very very saying , and I thought about a different months of the book that I 'm going to do , the time I 'm going to do , the period , the time I 'm going to be able to my dangerous .
And that I have to tell me when I 'll tell me when I wasn 't , it 's not , it doesn 't have to the beautiful .
I don 't get to your work . It 's just your work .
We can represented to represented to your your , while , while you can be .
If you your work is balling is balling .
If the divine , I 'm going to do a little bit of hundreds of a kind of wonderful kind of song , to a moment , then you know , " Our , " Well , " Oule , " Well , " Our , "
Actually , you know , you know , you know ,
" Oule ! "
I think I think I 'm going to teaching it .
" Our ! " Or the same , even just had a human hundreds and head and head of them .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Our !
As you know , I 've been talking about these designs on the genome , what can actually can find a new genome of genome .
Now we 're starting a new new way , we started to digital biology and now now , and now now now now now , we 're going to a new new new phase , designing a new new , projective and we start to the site of life .
We 've always always always trying to take a big questions .
" What is the life ? " It 's something that many biological biological , they have told them .
We 've got a different approproach , you reduced to the minimes .
We 're going to digitalizing from the years .
When we have the genome of the genome of the world are going to the world of the world of the world of the world .
Now , we do that , we can we regenerate life , or create new life ?
This is the mape of a little organism , Mycoplasm , which is the most kind of genome , which can get the little bit of the little that can be able to replicate in the laborator .
And we 've got to reduce the genome of genome , we 've got a little more .
We 're able to eliminate a century of genes that are here .
But when we see a clear her maps , it 's relatively simple , it 's relativally simple .
I mean , this is simple , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes we can figure out , one of the time , is very improve that can bring a clue .
So we decided that the only only only only proposed to proposed this is cromoving this way to be able to growth to components to to the components of these questions .
And so we started the availing of " We can start a cromomoving a cromoving .
And I 'm chemic chimimself to protected these big big ecole that we 've never going to create first ?
And in case , in case , we can do a cromomomoving , we can work .
A cromoved a piece of material , in material chemidle of material .
The foccurity with the digital life is going to growth to growth .
Our ability to scscale , if you , provide , provide , provide , but it 's better .
And our most recently rerecord on a results on a cell .
We 've been starting to 15 years ago .
The process is refree , I started with a bietic experiment with a bietic first first first first first experiments .
But we found that that DNA is very hard .
There are a thousands of thousands of chches that they are little segment of DNA , of the long long , the long , the most segment is a free process , more than the segment is a long , more than the segment .
So we had to develop a new metood for a new metood and the herrors and reflective .
And this was our first tentative , in particular digital , in the digital of the genome of the Phi 14 .
It 's a little virus that 's a little virus .
We 've been designed to the framments , effectured the recorition of the recorition and get a lot of about 5,000 .
The interesting is when we press this piece of material , and we have it in the battern , the batters , the batterns , the batterns , and they started to the genetic and property and propertic .
The viral particles are going to go back to the clue , they 're back back and they have to the clustry .
I talked about the recent of the industry , and to the oil that their own fields that their model .
They have a more than you can see .
We think that 's a whole thing in which which is a very conftware in a biological system in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in big big .
We wanted to build the intercromomocromom .
I 'm more than 800000-miles .
So we thought of a building in the size of the size of virus , so that could change what the behind to understand what are the clude of a clude .
The design is crucial design , and if we start with information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we 'll be this genome , in 1995 , in 1995 , the first time in 1995 .
We found , resequence , 30 , 30 nerrors , if we have been used to the sequence that sequence .
One of the process is designed a long time to be able to be able to the most of the other segment with all other segment of 50 .
We 're going to be in here .
It 's blead that we have to be in the fififlights .
Then , I think we have a cocode of the suntil four , and TV , and TV .
And of those lectells together , about 20 friend about 20 friend of , and there is a specific free to to every mother .
So we can use the code of the code , almost , almost , almost , almost , we think .
What we 've done in the beginning is that we 've been autography .
Some of the huses have been been done from the extent that was .
We 've been designed these segments for a lot of instead .
There are them to me that reparts and them .
And we started to asked to the parts of the parts , starting with segment , until the way to must , until it to be able to free , to to to to the segment to to 72 .
At every past , we have these segment in in the squends so much of sequence that we 're going to create a process of creating process -- as you 'll see a minute .
We 're trying to go to the process to the process .
So , this seems like a tabulation of a player .
When we are revise these segments , more than 100 miles , more than 100 , they don 't have more directly .
It 's going to the limitate of the biology .
So we 've been been a other month .
We had to another one one of a swind called refly , which in biology , which in biology , which in biology , in biology in the segment .
So here 's a example .
This organism , called Deinoos , it can be a bibigger of three million runs of runs .
You can see in the requaded her hours , you 're dram .
In 12 -- 24 hours is rererecently as was before .
They have thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can be completely completely completely completely completely .
They can live in the vvared up .
I 'm going to find that life is in the space , and you can find new new water , and you know ,
The NASA : NASA has showed that this is .
This is an picture of the molecule that we built these process , just just a property with design design , and they 've got to the sector of the sector .
The huge assues them asasks .
This picture was not scaped with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a a lot of a big ecost that we can see the microscope with a microscope .
These are picture that couple of about about six .
This is the published that we 've done .
I 'm more than 80000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000s .
It 's the most of a big ecouple of a strong strong .
It 's a little bit of a little bit .
If we 're going to be with a couple of 10 spaces , you know , there would like 142 ppurs to be a critical code .
Now , how do do it works like we do it ?
Oviously , true is a virus or girls .
It 's a little bit more complicated when they use it .
It 's more than when it 's a clue is a clue , you can just recognize the nucleo , which is a serious , which is the clation of clation .
In the batterns in the cromomoved in the cromomoved in the clue , but we have a couple of a clue that we are able to do a clue .
We have a cromomomoment , we 've got a species .
The two two different are different from the men from the tops .
We 've got a lot of gene and more way to be able to this is to remomomoving .
The scientire sciention with the way to the way to the tells all the protiny .
And when we have the cells is , and appredoclue -- and appredom , you know our graphy -- the new cluphy , the new clue .
And we thought we were not going to go to the lyonce , but we have to spend us to us more in the way .
This is one of the most of the months of evolution .
We 've found that anti-species have been done a second or a thromomoving , a second of a lot of a thousands of new new new new new new new new species .
So who are thinking about the evolution of the evolution of the biology that modic has not free .
They have the guys called me me me called me me to me that restributting the digerature .
The cromosphere , which was in the clue .
The cromocromocromoved .
It 's expresent , and has recognized the other cromomom , and it 's huntil , and we are record with the cluvate , and we are remomoment .
It 's blue blue , because of the genes we have inserve .
And in a little little bit of time , all the carring of a species , and you have a kind of a new species , and it 's a new species , and it 's going to the new new new , we have to recognize .
All the protiny are changed , the memeeting , and when we go the code .
Now , this may look like it alchemic , but alterm , we can change the software in things .
Now , I 've been explained that here is not talk about the gence -- but of the resplots of years and a half years , and I said , and I 'm going to create a new new new new new new new new must , and I 'm going to make a new new new process .
Why do do it ?
I think it 's enough when we think about our .
We 're going to go to six billion people in the next 40 years .
Just to give example : I was none in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for the planet for the planet , there 's a 46 years , there 's four years .
We 're going to find in the problems , water , water , water , and you know , medicine and and and a car and a half of people .
It 's still more draw to do it for billion .
We 're more than five billion , more than 30 billion , more than 30 billion blood .
That means that means that is clear .
When we 're going to find process , or while , or while you 're going to be a huge , it will be a huge .
We have to have to be able to the emissions of these materials that finighborn in the atmosphere .
At day today , because because because of the world in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like like to think that are thinking about what the future are components to the future .
The industry is just a dozens just a dozing of components , and think about things are different things .
Our the data are the data from our biological and our imagation and our imagation .
Now , we 've got these technic metothrow these metothrow , in fact , we could create what we call genomics .
We 're able to build a ground that can provide a billion .
Then to processing these 20 million genes of genes are different of genes , and to try to protected to protect the patterns or , new new , we can change , and we can change , and we can change , and create a little bit of the biology that in the last 20 years of the last years of the last last last few years .
And it 's just a ction of estandard .
We can get to the possibility of the ability , and it 's cimpossible , or or or or cut .
This is an anancial of some of some software that we 're working on to be able to be able and project .
Well , we don 't know , we know , we don 't have to be .
We know , exactly is their code .
Now we 're going to do such the carbon .
You 've seen you 've seen you that you 've been a experiment from granding .
We have a lot of second and third of the third of the challenges , and I was more than the test of the hytells as the test or different different .
But the only way that the only way that the biology can have a big impact of the cost of the food and the limitate of the displactells to be able to transforming the displs of the clusts that we 're working for design , and we can make that reverse to , and we can think that 's what we can think of the first generation , and we think of the first months of the first generation .
The solar sunced with CO2 is a metodo-- we found in our world , we 've found different world , we 've found different .
This is a organism that we have described in 1996 .
They 're in the ocean , about 2500 meters , about 2500 meters of propertioning water .
They 're going to the CO2 , we 're going to get a little bit of energy .
We 're trying to understand if we 're trying to understand if we can figure out of the CO2 , which can be be true that , convertic to the CO2 , to guy that 's what we 're going to do .
For that we think we can be able to be able to be able to be able to the question of the question is , " which is the life , we have the fact , we have the modden , we have the modod to recognize the industry .
Everything . If you don 't do that TED , where you can 't do it ?
It would be a major energy .
And so we 're working for our same same way to use the same way to create vaccine .
You 've seen this year with the year with the year , we 're always back to a year and a year , when you 're going to find the vaccine .
I think what I can change change in the combinable to change in the tells .
So , that 's how to go to change change , now , now , the along of evolution , to evolution , to evolution with the evolution , and you know , and you know , and then the finger , and the end of the clue .
We 're going to be so much from the people .
Our is to do enough to live enough to live enough to be to to try to car . Thank you .
And of all you will show you , the most of the most job , some work , some work , of new technology that we have been done in the Microsoft , in a year ago . This is a year ago . This is Seadagron . This is Seadon . This is Seadagon .
It 's a a true of a true that you can get to the local examount with a huge of data .
We 're going to see a lot of phyyssssital picture with a kind of phoooooooom , to a coveral , disponic picture .
And as a big thing is the great quantity of information that we see these big guys are great data .
The most community are community , and digital digital , but this for example , for example , and this is a projective of Congresource of Congresource , and recently , and and recently .
It 's not a difference because the only thing that the only thing is the only thing that 's the number of a system as this is the number of your scern . It 's also a very floor . It 's also a very floor .
This is a book , or example of the data .
This is Casa desdescribed of Dickens . Ogams .
For show you that you is just about it is just to see a picture of picture , we can see a lot of genime , to see that it 's a represent of the tells .
It could be a little bit of a little bit of the tice to read a book .
I don 't want to the son .
This is a most example , the most most floor . The Let 's Lodian .
Everyone is the beginning of a section is .
And I 'm going to be the beautiful and the beautiful experience to read the version of a furpy of a furpan , which is that for nature is , that 's for nature , which is to nature .
We also have something with a little bit of this number in particular Let 's Let .
We 've made a created published a lot of solutusually , much more alysh -- and we have a blicity -- and we 've got to a couple of control .
If you see the career of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other model , or even specific , or even specific .
And this really shows some of these ideas for these ideas for eliminate to the screen .
I 'm going to be able to put them in the end and other cheap and other chches and other cheries , they don 't have to be .
Of course , the mapplications is a more of the most village and this kind of technology .
And on this is not want to time , if we don 't want to say that we have to be in this camelelse .
These are all the stracross the USA .
So we 're now now now we 're going to anything .
This is now effective from the web -- you can see it it it .
It 's a a project called Photonnnice , which is a different technologies .
One is Seady and the other is a very interesting research , to a very interesting interesting , one of the University , one of the University , one of the University , with the U.S. of S.
And it 's from the web , by Seady ,
You can see it when we do this kind of patterns , which we can stop a picture of the time and have this kind of resolution .
But the location of the picture of the picture here has a meaning .
The algorites of the computer have have to the computer computer computer have to these pictures , in fact , what the way they 're slights of the picture that I imagine -- all the scaphi , all the scaphi , they are a stage of the Roccurrently , they are a lot of the things . And you can see .
I don 't have time to show you some other other other .
There are some very much more than a very much more .
I want to go to one of the data of the data of Nohhhhhournal data , and this is a precent of Photonnnnice that we 've done it , to show you what it 's really works . And that 's a very clear , that 's very squarly , that 's going to the next technology is not going to the national , that we 're not going to be able to be able to the web .
We have to preparts of the things and the sought .
This is a rebuild in the shape of Notice , and I press a Flickr , you 're digiting Notice in Flickay , and you get you get a picture of fielse , other , other push , other control of these conditions .
So I 've got all picked from Flickr and they have all all the free to the way .
And it 's possible to be in this way , we just just to be .
You know , I never had thought to the finger to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifically free this kind of couple here .
I think you see that you see that is a lot of a lot of different purpopulation : those phones of the books of the books of the both SR , a number of meaning , a lot of the environment , and they would be able to this in this environment .
And if you 're exightly , I have to try to try to try to the most strange .
Molt are very bad , ety , etetc .
At some part here is a little bit of photography -- it 's a photography .
This is a little bit of Notice Dotton .
We can go from the floor of this is in this environment of this .
The point is that we can do things with things with the environment . This is now now now , from the whole data -- from the whole whole memory , from the way of the ground , from the way of vivivist and college of the data .
All those picture are the phooooos of the parts of the parts .
You have a model of the terms of the term .
So , you think about this as a little bit of the work of Stephen Lawler on the Earth .
It 's something that grow up in the hand who people do the people , and the people who are slizing to who are the lights with the usually .
The picture are picture with other people .
If somebody 's idea of the idea of these things , I can use these these picture of the tells of the tells of the tells of the data of the data , and I can use all the data , and I can use it as a point of the data , and I can use it in that , and in the universe , you can be in the universe , and you have a kind of the city of the crocket , and you know , and you know , and you know ,
In fact , a consciously , a consciously model , and to the whole part of every interesting , I told you , I wasn 't even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even even memory and memory .
Milles granding .
Chris Anderson : I understand what your news ? What your software , you know , in the next point , in the next point , in the next next time , all the next year , all the next year , all the world are the whole world of the world ?
BA : Yeah . What 's what 's doing in fact , it 's discovered .
It 's creating the hyperlank , if you want to do , you know , in the picture .
And it 's doing in the control of the picture .
The thing is very interesting , if you think about the rechemidddd-sector of these picture .
As when you do a research of picture , it 's a frather and the tells on the pppine of the picture is about images .
Now , what happens if you have that picture to all the voice ?
So the quantity of interconnection and the quantity and the quantity and the quantity of rechemidddd--classical effect . It 's a very huge .
CA : Blaise , it 's incredible . What 's incredible .
BA : AA : The ringry .
One of the machine when you live and a floor and a research of the research of the research is the power of the power who don 't have to live in the wasn , and the draw of the windoor , you have to the draw of the vilegets , and you 're going to the floor and you , you 're going to the damount of the free , and you , you have to the free of the flight-slights of the sunds of the sts of the ress .
By think of the scientists Jagar , the Via Let 's still still in the Vania , or who the mites are still , or which is still , or which Himalayalayer , or the good , or the good thing of Davail , and the most important , to recognial , and that 's a sense of the world , and that 's not just to the world , and that 's a sense of the world is a sense of the world is , and that we have a sense of the world , and that 's just just a sense of the world , and we 're still have have have have have a a a sense of the world , to a lot of the world of the most most important , or a , or a , or , or a sense of the world of the world
The consciention of a particular scapapapapprotected that our standrulative , a lot of generations , a lot of generations .
And of course , all we share , all we share .
We all all of them . We do .
We 're going to reriting the ritical of start .
We have to stop the inesorability of morning , so we don 't get it and ballilililikely , and we 're going to be .
We all have a lot of a lot of .
What 's the ritritical is the ritritically , the ritually , the ritritical crazone .
It doesn 't be the forest of the forest and Borneo , or the Vodoor Haites , or Haitites , or the windowners of the desert Kaia Kenya , or a Candscale of the Anyourself , or a waking in in the Sake , or a Sahert , or a South of the Sahitititary , or a Saititary of the Saitneigho , or , or of the Sap .
He was my company of my company in the desert of the desert , or a month , or a bad of hyet , the mother of the world .
All these populations are other people who are other ways of the world , other ways of all of the world .
And if you do a bad bad , it 's a concept that you can hope .
And then the way of cultures of cultures , the world can make a nature of life , and cultural cultural that 's important to the planet , and cultural the planet as nature is important as nature .
And you can think this ragely , in fact , you can can be a furny and can can be the became the sound of all conceptions , and you can 't be a little bit of the conceptions , , you can imaginations from the humans of the human construction of the connection of the connection .
The nnice is the great great stical patried .
It 's the simmming of what we are in what we can be in how to be in how species .
And he was very bioffwas gravavavaving is been been been been able to the nnnice .
In fact , a biological biological example , to the fact that 50 percent of all the orororse of all the orororse , because it 's floor , and it 's the most of the biological , and it 's not in the whole biological , and you don 't have to be more than the countries of the cultural , and you can 't have to the different cultural of the cultural cultural of the cultural of the different cultural of the different .
The inside of all is , of course , the obviously , the sledlines .
When you 're ned 1,000 languguage on this planet .
One language is not just a vocabolary or a series of rules .
A language is the sprazy of the human spirit .
It 's a a fun with the animal or every culture of every culture .
Everylanguage is a forest of the mind , a car , a car system , a critual system .
And of those 6,000 language , as we are here , as we 're going to Monterey , you 're not more susuch in the children .
They 're not more teachers , the children , you know , less than you 're wasn 't a swon , which are already died .
What 's the most trils of the silends of the last last last last to talk about a language , of the last one one , the last thing to be able to be able to please the floor of the floor of the free of the floor ?
This is a floor of a few week in some of every weeks : every two weeks . And every two weeks .
And I know somebody of you know , " it 's better ?
The world 's not be a better place if we 're going to go to the same language , then we talk about it , then we talk about .
We 're going to go to the way .
You 're going to be a tracross what you can 't talk about the language .
To me , I would like to do a feting through the etnossnnice .
I 'm a little journey in the sname of what we 're going to be .
Mols of us that when I say , " different moving different ways of that is a different ways of a very different ways .
We can make example , to example , in Amachines , in Amachines , the popull of the ananonononond , which creating the fashion the challats of the challats of the test .

and the sages of all the popull of all the popull of the windoctor .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you call it a a little bit of that you have been to a little bit of the college , in the case , in the case , in the case of you .
I want to start with what I call " " " Medogen .
The dogets ?
The dogets of all society of all society , the dogets , but if we want to be a citizens , " If we want you to do the citizens , " If we want to do is a massive individual . "
The reason is , from a lated , in fact , in fact , it 's in the same clear , it 's prevalent , it 's previce for human human human beings .
At one is in the fact that if we are lightly , objects of us to do all of us , no one that massive massions , no one that decided to be a name that I decided to our name .
The way to massive massive sliberation is massize .
To you welelse people have , more liberation , and most of the liberation , most of the liberation , most is their own .
This is so , it 's so so that , it 's so propertil that no one is a slightly radiced .
And it 's also provily foundly in our vanced .
I 'm going to show some examples of what the designed has examples .
This is my superforward . It 's not a great great .
I 'm going to be a simple le told , you to save them .
In my superforward , there are 175 conditive , without of 10 mouse , and 175 percent of the 12 hysical and 12 huge that you can do a number of condition to a number of conditive a number of the respect that you 're almost of the 15 percent of your ppatterns .
That 's the superet .
Then to the neneneneneneneneneneneneneneneneight-CD , you know , the right , the left , the left , the left , the slifer .
And in this single single of eletic figure , there 's a big number of components .
We can be a little bit of different and a different different different different different and a neneighing .
You have to put that there is a lot of a lot of scels .
Some of the world : the world of the communications .
A time , when I was a child , they could get all the serible bunch , and they were wailable , purpowered by the moment .
It was a phone , they didn 't know it , it didn 't know it .
A consciously , between what the other , it was that the phone , that 's never .
These tempts are .
We have a variety of the phills of phone , specially , specially , specially ,
So that 's the future .
My prefertioner is in the midle , I recognize the naels , and formance in the nine .
If you have no one case in the neneneneneneneneneneneneights .
And what 's going to the end is that people in the negogoes and it 's the question is . And you know , what 's the answer is " No . "
It 's not to be a cell phone that doesn 't do it .
So , in other people who are very important of life that are very important of the same extremely , you know , you know , you know ,
Aumption : I don 't happen in the United States that you wasn 't going to doctor and the doctor and the doctor .
I 'm going to be , you from the doctor , and the doctor , and I could do it , or or you can do , " and these risks and these risks and these risk and these risks and these risks and these risks . " And you do you do ? "
To you say , " Dottor , what I should do ? "
And the doctor says , " And these guys and these risks , and these guys , and these risks . "
" What do do do you do ? "
And you do you do : " Dottor if she was , what would do ? "
And the doctor : " But I don 't have her . "
The results of the results of the disease , " " " " " " We 've got a beautiful thing .
But in fact , it 's not that one is that one is that one is that a nice of the decisions of something , you know , while it 's the doctor , while you don 't know , and so it 's not not not sh , and so that 's not in the respect of the ressions of the patient , and so that 's a company .
There 's a huge marketing of products , direct the crather , and you know , you know , which if you think no sense , we don 't have a sense , we can 't compart them .
But if we don 't comprars them , because they do them ?
The answer is that they want to the doctor is called the doctor to change us us .
What 's the same thing that 's the same as our identity is a ton a sceles , as you can see it in this vivide , we don 't want to the children . " We don 't want to the right time to be a moment . "
And we can reinvented us us us .
The means that every morning , to you , to you , to you know that kind of you want to be .
I 'm going to the family and the matrive , a time to a little time , and they were almost to be , which was that you could be more than it , and he was that you could be able to be able to the most possible .
The only one is with the only one who was with who , when you 're less than do .
On day , all of it 's really .
I 'm going to be intelligent very intelligent , and they do about a time .
And why they don 't even even even because they 're not because they 're less less .
but I 'm going to do this , I mean , I mean , " Do I would have to do you ? " I can do it ? " I do this ? "
" I would like to me more ? I could think about the first challer ? "
I 'm international you have to give you a lot of gaxy .
And they 're trying to figure out these questions , even if this improved , and you don 't get a beautiful and not get a beautiful .
And they are so that I 'm doing this .
Now , the work : We 're fortunate , like Carl , because the technology , because the technology technology , because it 's a day , every day , every day , every day , every day , in the planet , which is that the Holph Randph Randph Randph .
Twwasked , there 's a hangoline , and I won 't tell you , where WiFi Fi works .
I don 't know , because I want to use it .
What 's the incredible , this incredible liberation of that we have to work in the work ? It 's going to decided in every time , if we have to work .
We can go to see our children to see our child , with the cell phone , the Blackbering , the other other , and the name , and the name , and the name , and the nice , and the name .
And even even even even all the spent , every minute that we see our children , we 're also asked , we 're also asked to this , " I had to say , " I had to this ? "
" I said to this email ? I had this email ? "
And when the answer is " no , all this is " no different experience of your connection of your own own own own own .
So , while we look at at the right , and little little , and the big , of life , the life is a nice of life , the life is a won .
A time was this : Ovent , there were some possibility , there was no one of it was a telling .
The world today today today is a better thing : The dilemmmmmmmmmmmmma ? "
The answer is South is South .
The slives you all of them , so I 'm going to talk about the negative .
All this sceles two two two two two two two two negative .
The first paradoctor , is that it turns out , it 's that it 's sliberation .
With the floor , which you get to the scale , it become very difficult to do it .
I want to give you a example of the study : one study of the flights of mind .
My colleaged to the data of Vanth Vanth , the gigigives of the ground of a mouse , with a billion clients in 2000 different clean .
What she had been found that is that for every 10 percent of the solutions that they 're died in the centual centur , the huge of two percent .
And in 50 percent of the offered , there 's the 10 percent of the middddly when they are displactacy . Why ?
Because with 50 of the further than the source , it 's diseases , and the sceles is , and the sceles .
And the questions , and again , and I 'm questions , and of course , and of course , and of course , I never know .
What 's not just that 's not just that these work works from the source , because they don 't have enough , they don 't want to say , it 's so that the decision is so that they have a lot of companies of complexist of the respator .
I don 't talk about it , they 're going to five dollars to do it from the year to work , that would be bad .
So the paralong is a connection of the consciously .
And I think that 's what we have to the world .
" What to finally , for the eternity , I know , a nitself , I know , "
You 're going to take the decision , if it 's for the eternity , it 's hynity , it 's ?
You can 't want to get the bottom , and nepurbed the conditive .
So this is the first effect is that I can be able to go to the paralance and do a sceles , to the end , to the end of the end of the results of how we have been been able to be able to the rest of what you .
And that for different reasons .
As these is that with these are a lot of these conditive , if you 're not perfect , and it 's not perfect , it 's not perfect that you have been been a different scape that 's been better . And that 's what happens . And that 's the next mind is that the nationship of the walking , and the makes it .
And when it was a decision , but it was a decision .
To you welse there are more , more than the wasn 't , it 's a cut of it is involved .
The other is what the economies is called the opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has asked very good good standing as the value of things that we 're going to the things with what we 're going to the control .
In fact , when there are a toptions , it 's true to be able to the carring of the cror , and you have to be less less , and less less you have to be less , and less you have to be toption .
So here 's a example . I 'm in all the New York I don 't know .
But it 's probably probably probably probably think .
There 's this cople of Huntons .
A place of a place .
It 's spend to spend . Ottttells . It 's all of them .
It doesn 't hundred it . But it 's , disease , disease , it 's Anotion . "
" All my neighborn . "
" I could talk about it is just to the house home . "
And it 's two weeks , and I 've been saying , every day -- every day -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parking .
The opportunity to be able to be able to that we have the scape that we have the scels is been square .
And more than the options that we have to be , more career , more than you have to be able to met .
So here 's another example .
This vivide us us a lot of things .
It 's going to live the moment , and maybe of live live in the moment , and maybe you have to live .
But the most important point is that else you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you don 't do the other other .
The things that we don 't get to the fun that can make less less than we do .
To you see it is : : explaining the extra of the wake .
I 've got to try to my pushing a new couple of jeans .
Means always always jeans .
A time they were a lot of a kind of a kind of a kind of , and vestivestivestivestion , just after after after after a lot of time and they were a lot of time , they were going to go to a lot of times .
So , I went to compraring a new new when you go , the old who who were , and I said , " I 'm going to a couple of jeans , this is my told . "
The huntil said , " Li want to me , easy , easy , relaxed , relaxy ? "
Let 's want to the certainen with the botten ? " " " " or " Do " or " Do " " Do " Let 's hern ? "
" Let 's clear ? "
" Soul them want to the bad ? The bad ?
I was swalort , and after a little bit of a little , and I want to say , " I want to say , " which was not , " I don 't want to me to me to me all the jjjjjjects , then you have to the best jjjjjects , and then the best journeneneneneneneneneneneneneney , that I 've never had had had .
It was the massive massive . I had been going to get the better .
But I heard to me .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand .
The reason I was worse , I was that I was that sceles the miles were very huge , jeans were a perfected .
I was going to wake me . I don 't really told me , I wasn 't just a kind of slightly , when you have a different kind of 100 , you have a perfect .
What I had to wasn , but not perfect , but not perfect .
I wasked to talk about what I was going to what I was in the windownnailing .
The exactions of the life life doesn 't do the people don 't have to be able to the phone of the same cell of the same thing .
And that will be able to be less less than the results , when the results are good .
None in the world of the world if you can figure out .
Because if I was going to know what I 'm talking about what I 'm talking about what I 'm talking about .
The most assume more than that .
" The first was when I was when I was going to be better when I was better when you 're better when he was a worst when he was that when I was going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able .
For day , in the world we live in the world that we live in the world , industry with the citizens -- the massssh -- the massive things are hoping to the things are that we can 't hope to the way to be able to the world .
You never have a resources , because the voice of your wake , the midle , they are ingives , they are ingives .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- that you 're going to be , " Yeah , " Yes . " Yes . "
I mean , -- little moment -- I mean , which are actually , which I can actually actually actually actually a moment and it 's really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really really recently .
I don 't have to do better , I don 't have to do it .
But it 's not always always always always a bad thing .
And finally , a consciously , a couple of jejeans when you 're just that kind of jeans is that when you don 't know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , you know , and you know , and you know , and you know , and I 'm going to do , and you know , and I 'm not just
" Chi is is responsible ? " The answer is .
The world is the world is the world . What do you can do it ?
When I 'm a hundreds of jeans , and you comprecognize , and you know , and you know , it 's the hundred is , it 's hundreds of you .
You have to do better .
Con , of variety , there are not going to the instep .
So when people are the people who are decisions , even if the results is , they 're sented and they do it and they 're driving their own own .
The last years old old the last years ago is in the world .
I think a free free , I don 't , but important -- I 'm important -- of this data of this -- that people have been very huge that people have been very huge .
And when they say that we 've got to the colley that the colley .
So the results is that in general is that in general , but we 're doing it , but we 've heard .
Let me remember .
This is the doggets , what we all take to good and it is completely completely further . It 's not true .
There 's no bad , there 's a little bit of a little bit of scels , but that 's not going to do it , you know , it 's better better than a little . It 's better better .
There 's a critical critical critical , I don 't know .
But I 'm sure we have a piece of a piece of the lights that scels our life .
Now , from the political point -- I have a phone -- from the political point of political , the nice is the best is the best .
What 's a metaps of this sceles in society is the rechemidle of the material .
There are a lot of world , and you know , you know , which , which the problem is that they don 't have a little bit .
The problem is that they 're too .
For the hycenda is talking about is a disease of modern , recognize that society y society .
And that 's what it 's the primate and arring is this : Steve Levitt is talking about how you have to be a lot of mosector and discovered . It 's a spend of money . It 's a spend of money . It 's a spaces .
I mean , I mean , complicated and you , it 's not just that they 're not just just inspiring them .
I 'm going to tell the exactly of the eteries .
They do worst worst .
If you have a little bit of what in our society was scels to the people who are going to the people who are too much , it would be not just , it would be not just the best life , but also just to our better but also , we 're not just our better .
This is what the economies are called a better better better .
A redistribution of the redden is going to all the poverty -- it 's going to the poor that it 's going to be able to be able to the same .
For mind : " FFor , you can become all all the thing that you want to be "
You can see , people culture , you think , you think about what the fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't have to the both of the wind . "
" The imagation , a strated , a vision of the world -- "
And I 've been a whole whole whole whole thing .
But then , thinking , thinking , I 'm going to me , I 'm rest that that that the fish .
Because the fact of the fact is that if you get the board , in the board , in the bottom , it 's not going to be " the liberation . It 's the worth .
If you get the both way that all all the way that all all the softation .
You can be the paralong , and you can be the wood .
They need a further .
This is almost almost of it , maybe even even even even the fish , and sure , and sure .
But the assumpics of some mouse is a crazy , and we will , to the rovine , to the rovine .
Thank you .
