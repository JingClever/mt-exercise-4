The year I showed these slide demonstrate that the calculus to show that the glacial glacial , which for almost three million years of the United States continental continental .
But this is the gravity of the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice .
The calculial glacial calculus is , in a certain sense , the cubults of global climate system .
It 's wind and you reverse it .
The next slide is going to be a fast-silightened carlate , the last 25 years .
The ice lost lost lost of draw .
As you can see , you 're going to the blue blue .
That 's the ice , the ice in the wind , which you can get up .
You can see that the cosidle , I said , " World , five years , is like the site , which is like the blood , which is like the blood .
In 25 years , it 's been been so ,
This is a problem because the interventire scale , the whole third ice ice ice where there are enormous amount of coal congelated that , scientists , they 're going to be transpent in meter .
Right to the totality of the atmosfertic tranquantity , that could be able to be able , superformance , superfort this point of not .
In some laghi , I 'm going to Alaska metary , the metane is already rebull .
The professorse Katey Walter Walter of Alaska team , I recently , a team took a team pressed landlandlago .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : I 'm good .
A reason is that this termal scale surroenvironment , the Groenland from the northern Groenland .
This is a glacial floor .
The took never reached it .
This is the Kangerluslier , in the sud-west of Groenland .
If you want to know how you know , the level of the ice of the ice of ice ice , here is where we reach it .
These corrate are increasing fastly .
Another part of the planet : Antarttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttart
The month shot scientists have dichieved that the gaxide is in negative , and the Antarctarttartttarttartttarcttarctttargogy , is particularly rapid .
Equval , six feet of the active active , like Groenland .
On Himalayas , the largest block , the largest block , they 're going to see new laghi , who were drilaghi .
40 percent of the world 's world 's recognize half of the water ,
Sulle Ande : this ice ice is the source of water water .
The braned .
But when it diminusually , the same access to water .
In California , the neve the Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The cycle is in the cribe .
The predictions , like you read , I 'm graves .
The growth secity in the world leads to a ninight ,
The environmental disaster , they 're going to a normal outside , and without previous .
Four times , in the last 30 years , you know , 75 .
This is a beautiful beyond .
If you look at it in the stories if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we add 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours , 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the Pacific area , the Eastern Pacific area , and on both , and on both the parts of subcontinent , where there 's a radical impoverty .
Most of the global scale , together to the deforestation , which is 20 percent , which is the 20 percent of combustiable .
The oil is a problem , and the coal problem , and it 's even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with the most emissions , together at China .
And it 's going to build a lot of other coal other coal .
But we 're going to have a change .
These are the annosed projects in the last few years and some propose alternative versus .
And every way , there 's a political political political .
The carbon industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promove the last year to promove the carbon , which is a bled-sim-site , which is a bysh .
The picture I remember in something --
I 'm going to go , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion liters of carbon scories .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second flow than scories in America .
It 's happened around Natale .
The publiity of the publish of coal industry was this .
Video : â™« Frosty the cookay , it 's a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abondant here in America , and growth our economy .
Frosty the carbonaium is always layer .
It 's a price , adorable , and the workers are handable .
Al Gore : Da lot of the West Virginia .
The greatest mineraria society is Massey Coal . This is Massey Coal . This is his frightens .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'm going to ask -- Al Gore , Nancy Peloften , Harry Reid -- not know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So Alleance for the Clima Clima has launched two walked .
This is a part .
Video : ALergy : ALergy see the climate change like a serious minactive change as a serious minactive sery .
For this is investing , the large amount of money in a very large public addrest to make public truth and confted the truth .
And the coal is not sport .
We think it 's also -- it 's also a good good ,
So , not preocupatevs .
Let me do it .
Video : Actor : I 've heard a lot of it .
So I 'm going to do a around the street of the structure of the walking , and it 's about the coal .
Straordinary ! The car is a little rumorous , but this is the sound of the coal technology .
The consumption is between the main cause causes of global warming , but the night technology of carbon technology , but the night that you see changes .
You have a look : This is the od-technology of the coal technology .
Al Gore : I finally , the size of the native economic issue and that 's the national security and the national security .
Video : Comvvance : The America is in the crisis , the national security , the national crisis .
The falls that all of them : our dependence from the combustiable , like the coal , like the coal , and the importantly ,
Now , there 's a new , caudace solution for use .
Repower , 100 percent of energy , in the 10 years .
A piece to put the work of America , make sure sure , and make sure , and help us stop the global warming warming the global warming .
Finally , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
Repower . Scoprite .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's about rewards : It 's rewards to America .
One of the fastest ways to take us to end the end of the comics that killing our planet .
What 's the future is here . I 'm here . I 'm here , just a new energy .
What 's going to be able to do ,
Coment : Repower . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old old , I 'm going to go fast , " If you want to go faster , go from the wind .
If you want to go away , go back , go together . "
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
They go back to TED pheculpted a Deal-LHC .
And I promise to go back to the nars you about how the machine .
So , I 've been . And for those who didn 't , the LHC is the biggest experiment ever , the largest experiment ever -- 27 miles .
His a task is to recognize the conditions that were less than a billion by the beginning of the beginning -- until 600 million times .
All of this is just environment .
This is the Ginevra .
We 're pictures , we Fig Bang Bang inside the rests .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLALATLATLAS -- it 's a 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS , you can see the proportions .
10 tember will scort the last year we have accesum the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
You know , it 's immense festablies in the saving control .
It 's a picture of the first phasm of the first particle of the LHC , both in collision , from the LHC , and I spread particle in the LHC , and spread particle in the refloor .
In other words , when we see that picture that picture 10 settember , we understand that machine was a great vitting .
I don 't know if it was to do this , when somebody went on Google and I won Google and vide that the beginning page .
That means that we have had a cultural impact .
It 's a week after , there was a problem with the machine , it had to these challenge here -- these dordered druled here .
These figure out 13,000 print when the machine works at the massive car works .
Now , the technical , the technical challengs and say , " It 's not true . "
And instead can do it because when they 're very cold , they can be cosidings .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a temperature in the space of the space between stars , these files can bring that corrate .
In one of the only way of the most novehicle magneti in LHC , there was a fell of fell .
So the flew up , and 13,000 printing , and 13,000 printing improvisually , they met a electrical resistance .
This was the results .
Now , this is more impressive if you think that these magnetans think that these magnetans fish , and that 's sector , and that 's about 30 centimeters .
They 're saying about 50 magnetans .
We had to leave them , what we had done .
We repristined and it .
Now , they 're coming back all of their place .
I finally hushing the LHC will be again .
We will happen , and we expect it to be able to get the data of the data , and we 're going to go out what the morning , and we 're going to discovered the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents , these accidents reaching the dibate value of science and engineering . It 's easy to confuture . It 's easy to confuture .
I think the fact that it 's so difficult , I think it 's the limits , I think it 's the value of things like LHC .
I would like to end with the words of a Inglese Inglese , Humphrey Davy , which , I imagine , in the defense of the experiments of his pupleash , his pupleasure , " Nichael Faraday , " Nichael Faraday , " " Nient is a very dangerous , which is not very dangerous .
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to start thinking about when children , children , play cover , play cover .
Whereas you realize them and they 're going to get them and take them and move them , and they 're going to learn them and they 're going to think , and they 're going to solve problems .
The reasoning space is depth connected to the way we understand the world around us .
So , from the information , by the use of our own own own own own physical interaction with my physical connection , and my collaborator , and my collaborator , I started to ask me , " If we use a computer , and when we use a computer , instead , and I would have a computer , that we could have the flexial , that we could deal with a desktop of the digital , and I could deal with a shape ,
and sistemulars our plaging ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , built the answer , built Siftable .
In powerful words , a Siftable , is a big computer interactive whatever they have a biggest whatever .
In powerful words , a Siftable , is a big computer interactive whatever they have a biggest whatever .
You can move with hand , you can see it , " You can see the movement and they can hear the movement and have a radio radio and a radio .
But it 's practice , they 're physics , like the morning , you can just move it .
Siftable is of a new ecosystem system to ecosystem to ecosystem to ecosystem .
And as they get more physical , conscious , the same movement , and as they 're going to be more physical , consciously , of the other , of how we move , we can explore new and different different different ways of interaction .
And I 'm going to do with a simple example .
This Siftable is configurated to show of the video : if you includes it in a direction , the video running .
These ritrats are conscious conscious conscious .
If you 're going to do it , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they 're circummmit , and they can get a little bit .
If they 're circummmit , and they can get a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We 've got to realize that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power of the data , " " " " versity " " " " " versation " a color like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , we have three Siftable , and I can use them to stay them in the central color , where they 're going to go .
and I can use them to work in the central color in the central , where they 're missing .
If we 're too too , we can put a little bit of it .
And I also , the beautiful opportunity to apprint , like languages , the mathematics and logical games where people can try and do things fast , and you can see the results of the results .
Now , I 'm now --
This is a Fibonacubonacuge sequence .
Here we have a words of words that 's half between Scarabeo and Boggle .
Pratically , at every turn out a literally , in a letter , Pratically , Pratically , every turn out a literally , and as you 're going to compories in every Siftable , and as you 're going to compories .
Then , after about 30 seconds , they 're going to be a new set of lectiny and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came to the Media Lab , I did it and I did it and I did it and turned a video .
They were very much .
And one of the interesting things to this kind of application is that you have to have a lot of education .
You 've just say , " What about the words , " and they 'll sleep .
Here 's what other people who are trying to .
This is our young waster , right there .
It was just just to implement them .
They 're just going to do it .
Now , this is a whole application of a interactive application .
We wanted to build a tool for the appractice of Lui Lui is Felix .
It can insert new characters in the scene , sold their own associated .
It can insert new characters in the scene , sold their own associated .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is sign .
David Merrill : Now he 's taken a tractor in the scene .
Video : The treator .
Bel ! Yeah ! !
So , I was going to go back and put up close , and put up closed up ,
Video : Bau !
-- inventing their story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It 's a window , and it can decide him how you fly .
DM : It 's a window , and it can decide him how you fly .
Video : I 'm going to go .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , it 's a tool , to walk and exequipment and exequal musical music .
It 's a tool , recently , to walk and exequally music .
Siftable here , they 're going to sound as base , based and the bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose .
You can enjoyed these soons in a sequence to your pleasure .
And it 's just doing it , they just touch a sound , " and a sequence . "
These are actually that you can control from the vive , like the reverby and filter .
And it 's a particular sound , and then inclad to pleass .
And then there are the general of time and flights , and you applicate the whole sequence .
We look at how it works .
Video : We 're going to put a base in two Siftable , " sequence , " We 're going to a series , we 're going to address .
Now , I put a basement .
Video : Now I 'm addition ,
Video : And I 'll put the filter , so I can control the battery , so I can control the effect of vive .
Video : I can fast the whole sequence sequence , inclinding the time from one or the other .
Video : And I 'm going to add the filter , to give more expression .
Video : I can recombining the sequence . "
So I don 't have to plan , but I can improvement , it 's a longer or more cort .
And now , finally , I can do the whole sequence sequence , inclinding the Siftable , " volume . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new interface , and more sounds and more sounds as well as our brain and corporate .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this perspent , and some possibility that we 're trying to bring out from the lab .
The concept that I want to transmitting is that there 's a new generation of projects for digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk with all you .
I 'm a writing .
I 'm going to writing my profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also the love and my life .
And I don 't expect that I can change .
But , I said , something particular happened in my life and my life , and my carry , who took me to realibrate the whole thing .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called " Manogy , Prega , Am , " Ame , " the different books , for some reason , for some reason , for some reason , for some reason , and it 's a great sensatisatised ,
And the results is that anywhere now , people treat me as if they were condamn .
It 's true -- I 'm swake , condamn .
They 're going to me to work and say , " I don 't have to be able to be able to do it ?
Don 't you get to write for all life without power to writer for all life without power ? "
which can do you feel ? "
It 's rashing , you know .
But it could go , at the worse , I remember that 20 years ago , when I started to say , I was a adolescent -- I was a writing .
I won or met the same way .
And people say , " I don 't told me to be able ?
Don 't you know that the use of the rest of killed you ?
Don 't you know , you know , to get this wasn 't that anything come out and die on a heart of the sound , and dead on a pinfrants with the pinfrants of fallivests ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yeah , I 've been putting all those things .
I 've always had been paid .
And I also have a lot of other things that people could not inate .
As the algain and other things .
But , as I 'm looking at what I thought and I was asked and I was going to be , and I was going to be why ?
Is it ?
It 's logical that anyone who 's expecting to be spent by a job that you 've been sent to do .
But what 's so particular in the impress creative impress us to make us nervous health health health care , in a way that other carry don 't do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemist engineer and I don 't remember in the time , and I don 't remember that if she had been asked to be engineer ?
Don 't it -- that blob of the engineer John , how do it ?
Don 't work so , you know ?
Onestly , engineers as chemistry don 't have certainly , in the secoli , driver the reputation of being alcolized .
We writers , we have enough to this reputation , and not just writers , but creative reputation of all gender , we have this reputation of being huge .
And it 's not more than you look at the sad of the dead of the magnific magnifiments that , only in the venture century , they 're died and often .
And the ones that don 't have to be really disappeared to be , they 're really disappears .
Norman Mailer , before , in the last interview , in the last interview , " I knew me a little bit more , " I knew me , " I 'm going to look at the work of their life .
But we don 't bledly when we heard these things , because we 've heard these things , so we 've got these things , and we 've completely interorized and the notion that creativity and the crazy are in some way , and that art , and that 's going to be in a way , and it will always , in the annotion .
And the question I want to bring all of what I want to take all of this idea ?
It 's good to be , because he 's also looking at a centimeter of distance to me , it doesn 't be good for anything .
I think it 's odioxide .
And I think it 's also dangerous , and I don 't want to see it .
I think it 's better to encouraging our big creative minds .
And I 'm sure that , in my case -- in my case -- it 's very dangerous to start to that I won the wall of the way I 'm going to be in my career .
It 's really -- I 'm looking , I 'm just young , I 'm just young , I 've been about 40 years .
I still have about four decadecades .
And it 's very likely that any thing I 'm going to write now , it will be juddated by the world as the work that was going to spend of my last book .
I 'm going to look , because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's likely to my greatest success to my biggest .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know , this is the gender thought that leads a person to start to start to start to start to ball the time morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would be going to continue to do this work that we love .
So , the question is , how ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflective , that the way to work to kekeep and write is to create a psychologist psychologist , OK ?
I had a few way to find a security sent distance between me , which I 'm written , and my natural anxious , which I 'm going to get it . And as I was trying to all the time , and I was going to look through the time , and I was looking at the time , and I was trying to find other society to see if they could have the best ideas and more sane .
on how to help people believe creative people who are emotional to make the emotional emotional creativity .
And that 's a research , he took me to the Great Rome .
I 'm going to guitem , and then back back back .
Nelil Great and anticy Rome -- people don 't seem to believe that creativity was from from humans , OK ?
And it thought the creativity was this spirit about the way , and that were being being in the men from a few sisters and switch , for reasons and disappeared .
The great-creativity , " demons of creativity " demons . "
Sococrate , wonderful , created it to have a demon that elargives wisdom .
The Romanaged was the same idea , but they called that species of the way .
which is great , because the Romanaged , because the Romans don 't really think a intelligent was somebody particularly smart .
They have to be that a genius was this kind of entity that they 've created living in the murs of the study of a study , a little like the Dobby , and that 's like the elfo Dobby , and that 's going to be able to to be on the work of the work and model of that work .
Exeal -- this is the distance of what I talk about -- that 's the psychologist that I 'm going to protected from your results .
And everybody knew that was so that it worked , right ?
So the arcies were protected by certain things , like , for example , how to be too narcism , not ?
If your work was except , except not to take it all the way , all of it was helped that they were helped by this genius .
If your work fallide , it wasn 't all all college , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people han concept the creativity in Occleanity for a long time .
Then Rinissue came and everything , and it 's changed , and we put this great idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe , and I writing space and writing and writing space and writing space to writing out of the divinity .
This was the major rational of the rational rational and people started thinking that creativity was completely completely by the ished Is .
And for the first time in the history , it 's going to referred this or that artist as a rather than a guy , I 'm going to a guess with a person .
And I have to tell , I think it was a big herror .
I think of somebody , a simple person to believe that , a simple person to believe as a recipient , the essence and the sigers of all my own own own own own devines , creative , inoscient and a responsibility , and that 's a very big walking .
It 's like to be like to ingotten the sun .
Deform and it completely , and it completely , and all these ingestiliable wait on performance .
And I think it was this pressure to have distroyed the artists in 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think it 's , the question , and now ?
Can we do it fun ?
Maybe , to go back to a more anticle compremote the most of the relationship between humans and miststery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't cannot cancer 500 years of thinking .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would be laittims that would be able to read the notion of the notion of the notion , undream of the way , you know , or they 're going to get their projects .
You know , you don 't convinced to you all about this thing .
But the question I would like to take is -- why not ?
Why don 't you think that 's this way ?
because it 's more sense of what ever ever ever heard to explain the exasperts of the exasperts of the process .
A process that , as anyone who ever ever ever ever , so , so , all of the fundamentally , all here -- you know , you don 't buy .
And , in fact , it can sometimes it looks completely paranormal .
I did this met recently with the extraordinary poetesse Ruth Stone , who 's 90 years , but it 's been a poetesse for all life and said that he was a poetesse in the Virginia , and he was going out in the wird , and heard it , and heard it was going to the wird .
He said , I was like a fragorous trenor .
And that was rotoling up to her from the pathetic pathetic .
He felt it , because he was so so so , because he was tremendous .
He knew what I would have a sold to that point and it was , " " You know , " " " I want to be like a matter . "
And so it 's towars and come up to this poetry , and it wouldn 't have to get another piece of card and a piece of card and a bunch of card , while the traphion , and the page .
three times , he could not be faster , so correct , so correct and correct and the rotoly rotoling and the rotolar and it would be going to a little bit through the rotoly , and he would keep up with the rotoly , and he said , " another poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece , I 'm not going to be -- there were moments in which was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was the corring home and he was trying to card and the poetry was going to the time , and he was a willing , and then he said , and then he said , that was how if you lists with the other hand and the willing .
He was the populled the poetry , and he was put it in his body and turned it into his body and turned on the page .
And in these cases , the poetry , it would be presented on the perfect page and inter , from the last word at the last word .
So when I felt it -- it 's crazy , is exactly ugual my process .
Not all my process -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a music , and my way to work is ; it wake up , and I 'm going to go and go and I 'm going to go and go and go and I 'm going to .
But I even , in my head , I 'm a shared against that thing , sometimes .
And I 'm imagine that many of you have the han .
You know , even if the work and the work and ideas were drive to me from a certain courselves .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relationship to exchange us , but , it 's not going to do it , but , rather , that do you do saying ?
For how I look , the best example contemporary contemporary example I have the Waititous muists , which I 've been different years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of the state state was the incarnation of the totally contemporary , to control these species of impulse creative species of impults ,
But then I invent , it 's going to be driving on a day , and it was driving on a autostraight to Los Angeles , changed it .
It was going to faster and all of a tract tracking this little framment of melodia , which is in his head as it does does the inspiration , and the wants , and the waste , and the waste , but it 's not as a wider , but not as a wasn .
It doesn 't have a piece of card , it doesn 't have a math .
So , I started to hear this species of old anxide , " I 'm going to lose , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'll look at this song .
I 'm not enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of go to the panic , you stop .
And he was going to be the mental process and it 's something completely new .
And he just look at the sky and said , " Scush , " Don 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" Do you know , you know , a song now ?
If you really want to be , back back in a moment more opports when I can take care of you .
Altrime , you wouddge to do anything else today .
I 'm going to go to the Leonard Cohen . "
And his process , he was changed after this .
I don 't work , the work was still dark as a always .
But the process , and the weight that was releaved when the genius , the genius that was re-handing , genius that 's been remained when it back to where it , and I went back to , and I 'll get it .
but he welling this peculiar , wonderful bizar-collaboration between Tom and this strange , and this strange and this strange , and this strange , and that was not Tom .
So , as the story I felt that story is also the way I was working and I was already save and I was already save .
This idea , I wledays when I was writing " Manogy , Am , " Ama , " and caddress in one that we 're working on something and we 're working on something and we can 't start to think that 's going to be a disaster , which is going to think it 's going to be a tagger , which is going to wrote .
Not just bad , just the worse , the worse .
And I started thinking of gareas this project .
But then I remember Tom who talked about the air and I tried to the air and try .
So I throwed my face on the handed and I recognize my fabsolute .
And I said , " Sent , " Sent , what 's both you know that if this book not going to be brilliant , not be a brilliant , not going to be interactly my , not going to be a burther ,
because as I see it 's just to me , I don 't have more than this .
So if you want it 's better , you have to presented you and do your part .
OK . But if I don 't do it , you know , I don 't do it .
I 'm going to writing the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to do that I 'm going to do my part of the world today , " because -- at the end of the end of Africa , OK -- secocle ago , " in the deserts of Africa , people were willing to the dances of the clear , dances that were willing , and the music , and the willing .
And they were magnific , because the ballerini were professionists and they were fantastic .
But every long , it 's all , something happened , and one of these artists became actually .
And I know what I 'm going to talk , because I know you 've seen it , at a certain point , a way , so that .
It was like the time , and the ballery walked , and the ballery walked through a species of bring , and it wasn 't .
And in the improvement , not as a human .
But it 's going to be accinside and under the window in the fuels of the divinity .
And when this is , when this was , the people knew what was , they called the " copytyet .
They had the hands and start cantable , " Allah , " Allah , Allah , God , God , " God . "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note stories -- when More invasering the soon of the Spagan , preserved this abitudines with their own change in the secle of " Allah , " " Olle , " " " Olle , " " " Olle , " that you can hear in the corners .
In Span , when a artist did something impossible and magical , " Allah , " Allah , " Allah , " I was , " I was , " I 'm going to understand , " I 'm going to God .
And it 's great because we need .
But the problem is the day , for the ballerin the wild , when you wake and discover that are the 11 morning of Martedayer , and I won 't have more .
It 's just a mortal gran with gran , and maybe you could not be able to cleanizing that altitude .
And maybe no anybody will sleep the name of God still while , and what 's going to do with his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most sweet to do in a creative life .
But maybe you have to be so angotable if you could not believe , you have not believe , excitutely , which is the most extraordinary , which is the most extraordinary of your own .
But it 's just just that you 're going to do this , I 'm going to be able to a inimaginable squisites of your life that you 've got to get anything else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think it all changes .
And so I started thinking , and it 's sure , and it 's sure as I thought for different months , I thought I 'm going to publishing the book that I 'm going to published , the periood , exisse , I was going to follow my great .
And what I have to continue when I feel when I feel elected by this is , not having .
Don 't go . It 's just your work .
It 's a present to your part , whatever , any could be .
If your work is balling , balling .
If the divine , I assurd , I 'm going to leave a few kind of wonderful kind of wonderful , for one moment through your forced forces , " " " Or ! "
Altrime , I do the same tua dance .
And " Ole ! "
I think it 's going to teach it .
" On you 're going to you to get the same , even had had a human love and tops , and tals to get you continue .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I 've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , what can meant and discovery of new genes .
Now we 're starting a new way : we started digitalize the biology and now , and now to start that digital code , we 're going to a new phase of biology , design and we 're going to go .
We 've always tried to bring big questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many biological biologs I think they have tented to understand vary livels .
We tried different approaching us , reduced it to the terms .
We 're digitalizing from the 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome , they were treated to the analogical world of the digital world of the digital world .
Now , we ask us : We can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the little kind of the little little organism in the little bit of those who can autorum .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little more little bit .
We are able to eliminate a hundred genes of the about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his map metabolic metabolic metabolic , it 's a very simple answer to our .
I think , I think , it 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , once , it 's very improbad that 's going to bring a living cellent cellent .
So we decided that the only way to provide was going to be synththize this cromosom to move the components to to take some of these fundamental questionents .
And so we started the " Posh we can synthetize a cromosom ? "
It 's the chemistring chemistring these big molecule that we 've never been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a cromosom ?
A cromosom is just a piece of material chemist .
The speakest fast that we are able to digitalize life is growing exponential .
Our ability to writing the genetic code , instead , rather , but it 's better better .
And our most recent results the results on a exponential curve .
We 've started a 15 years ago .
The process process has require a lot of past past , beginning with a bioetic reviewed .
But we found that synthetize DNA is very difficult .
There are thousands of thousands of cloud clonger segments of DNA , the long time , in the long , and it 's a process : the longer segment , the most herrors .
So we had to develop a new metodo this , to make these framments and correct these framments and the errors .
And this was our first tentative , to start information from the digital genome of Phi X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills .
We 've designed the framments , effectuated the correction of the errors and I got a molecule of DNA , about 5,000 lectable .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of material chemist , and we 've got it in the bacteria , the bacteria , and we 've got it to read this code and produced in the viral particle .
The viral particles are back back from the cells , they 're back back back and they 're back and distrutter .
I talked about recently with membranks of the oil industry that they have certainly compress that they have certainly compress .
They rerererererererepair .
We believe that this is a situation where software can really build the same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in the great things .
We wanted to build the whole cromosom of the battery .
It 's more than 580 miles .
So we thought I 'd build it in a seven of the virus of virus , so that we could change the cassed seven to understand what the components are of a living cells .
The design design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequence this genome for the first time in 1995 , the accuratitness was a herror for every 10 miles .
We found , 30 herrors , 30 herrors . If we had used that original sequence . We 've been able to be able to work .
One part of the process is designing segment , 50 longer that they have to all the other segments of 50 lectan , and they 're going to build subunity , and they work together .
We can go to the only one here .
You 've got a little bit of that we are in the floating .
Think , so we have a genetic code on four , and Two , and Two .
Three of those lectest , they 're about 20 , and there 's a specific order to be a specific order to the lectable ,
So we can use the genetic code to writing words , framework , depensive .
What we did at the beginning was autographed .
Some of them were willing from the fact that it wasn 't .
We 've designed these segments to just just take them to instead .
There are them to be a lot of them and put them .
And we started to assembly , we started with segments , starting with segments from five to segments , to spot segments of 24 miles , and they 're going to get 72 , and they 'll get to 72 .
So , we have these sequence sequence in a hundance , so that we 're going to create a very extremely robutstood -- like you 'll see in a minute .
We 're looking for automatize the process .
So , this looks like the tabells a playwild player .
When we 're going to these very long time , much longer segments , 100 miles don 't grow up in the Ecoli .
You get the limits of the modern modern toolally modern biology .
So we 've consider other mechanisms .
We had another mechanism called recombination recombination , which in biology , which is use to use DNA , which is to use the DNA segment ,
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococus radiodcocus , can absorbed three million radiation .
You can see in the sudperior like his romosome like his romosome .
In 12 , 24 hours is reassembed exactly like .
They 're thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms , you can security .
They can live under vacuum .
It 's just just sure that life is exist in space , and you know , and you know , to find new receive water .
And in fact , the NASA showed that this .
This is a picture of the molecule that we 've built these processes , just using these processes with design appropriate .
The listically listically fautomatically .
This picture was not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a molecule , very big that we can see it with a microscope .
These are picture that they cover a time of about six .
This is the publiblished we 've done time .
It 's more than 580,000 lectable .
It 's the great molecule , the largest structure ever created by man .
It 's a molecular weight to 300 million .
If we stamp it with a 10 without a 10 without spaces , we would like 142 pages to transmitting this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it ?
Of course , travel is a virus of girls .
It 's a little more complicated when they 're in the bacteria .
It 's the simplest when it 's a cell euclear cell as our , as our own : you can just extract the nucleo and inserious process .
In the battery , the cromosome is instead of integrated in the cell , but we have recently demonstrate that we are able to do a train of a cell , and we 've got to a cell of activity .
We can refied a romosom parting from a microbial species .
The two are different as humans .
We add a few gene in the most way to decide what you walk for this cromosom .
And then the scientist , I 'm going to kill all the protected .
And when we put it in the cell is stupend -- and appreciated our graph , the new cell phphphisticatomosom -- the new cell .
And we started thinking that we could not go to go over , but we tried to go back .
This is one of the major mechanisms .
We found that a lot of species have added to a second or a third cromosom from a second , advanced in a second thousand new tracks .
So who think of the evolution as a gene that 's just gene that modific modific modific biology .
And they 're the cymics called restription , which advanting digerism .
The cromosom that was in the cell of it .
The phone that we 've inserito-mosom that we 've inserito-sum .
And it 's expressed , and he recognized the other cromosom as a material material , and we 're returned with just the new cell and the new cell cell and the new cell .
It 's became blue because of the genes that we 've inserious .
And in a short time , all the carteristics of a species are going to go , and it 's turned out in a new species , based on the new software that we 've been inserious in the cell .
All the protected , the membrances are changed , and when we read the genetic code that 's exactly what we 've been travel .
Now , this might look allow genetic genetic , but it 's going to be able to change things in the software things in a sustainant .
Now , I 've been explained that here , I 'm not going to do this , but of progress to three and a half of evolution , and I said that we 're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian , where they will be new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's enough obvious when we think of our needs .
We 're going to go from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now , there 's three people on the planet for each one in 1946 ; it 's four .
We 're having problems now , water , water , water and fresh , water and clean and walking , and walking , and a half a billion people .
It 's going to be more drawy to be more .
We 're flexide five billion , over 30 billion baries , over 30 billion baries .
That means millions of baries at the day .
When we look at biological processes , or whatever , or whatever we look at them , it will be a huge challenging .
We have to have to keep all the way of CO2 from these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
At day , thank you to discoveries in the scientific discoveries in all the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are the components for the future .
The electronics industry only only goes a dozen , about components , and think of how many different things .
Our limits here are the biological data , and our imagination .
Now , we have the techniques , thank you , thank you , we can create what we call genomics genomics fight .
We are able to build a big robot that can produce a million cromosomes at a million cromosomes at the day .
Think of processing these 20 million different different genes or to try to be optimize the processing processing or or drugs , new vaccines , new vaccines , we can change , thank you , thane-year-old , and create more biology .
And it 's just a standard standard .
We can choose for a chance of survive survive , production , chemistry , production of the etc , production of the etc .
This is an instantancient instantancient programmed on which we 're working for being able to be able to sex and design species .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how they will be .
We know exactly what 's their genetic code .
Now we 're going to do the coal cooking of how generation .
You 've seen you that it 's been a finished experiment .
We have carbon and third generation that are going to be able to surround enough , and it 's a coal cket , or different kinds of treatment or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without increasing larger without increase , the cost of food and limitate the disponce , to be true to transform the CO2 in matter , which we 're working for design that we 're working for design , which we 're working to make this discovered , and we think of power in the way of those artment of how to be in about 18 months .
The light solar light , it 's a metodoctor is a metodoctor -- but in our world , we found different metodd .
This is a organism that we 've described in 1996 .
It 's in the ocean profound , about 2500 feet of deep deep deep section of water .
They 're in the CO2 , we 're using hydrogen molecular energy .
We 're trying to understand if we can incancer CO2 , which can be transported by the CO2 , to drive this process .
So , we think we could think we could be able to increase what the base question of the base that the base question of " which is life , " We have the synthrow -- we have the modesty of repair .
Exactly . If you don 't do it from TED , where you can you ?
It would be a main source .
For , we 're working to use the same metods to create vaccines .
You 've seen this year with the influence , we 're always back to a year and with a year and with a year and a year , and it 's a year .
I think that 's what you can change building vaccines .
Here 's how the future could start to look at , now , the treat the time , the treme of evolution , accept the evolution with bacteria , and finally cell eucariote .
We 're just to be as the best people .
Our discover is to be able to live enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
But I 'll show you , the most rapidly possible , a very foundly possible , some fundamental work , which we 've taken to the Microsoft in the following a year ago . This is Seadragon . This is Seadragon .
It 's a moment in which you can interact is about local level that remote with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of gabyte photographing with a species of zoom , and continuous fast , and it 's a quick panoramazing pictures , disponing the images like we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , as big are great these are great data or these images or images .
Most of the photographs , but this for example , this is a provent scansion from Biiiblic Congress , and it 's in the gamm of 300 megapixel .
It doesn 't have a difference because the only thing that 's what the prestations of a system like this is the number of pattern in your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data doesn 't images .
This is the Dickens . Every colonna represent . Every colonna represent .
For show you that 's just a test of tells and not images , we can do something like that , to do something that is to make a real real representation of the test , not a photos .
It could be a little artificial way to read a book .
It 's not to be advice .
This is a higher example . It 's a number of the Wek .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And it 's really the pleasure and the beautiful experience of the version of a version , or a quotidial version or a quotidial , which is for nature a molthemselves .
We also made something with the corner of this particular number of this particular number of the Look .
We created a fasulsed publish , it 's a very high , much more than that you use in a normal published -- and we 've got to you extra .
If you want to see the carteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other model , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We 're going to draw up , and you 'll get a few pop-up and other pop-up , they don 't have to be necessary .
And in fact , the mapplications is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this , I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't have to say that we have to give it in this weld .
These are all the streets in the U.S. .
So we 're going to go to something else .
This is actually actually , from the Web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
A is Seadragon and the other research is a visual research a very interesting research by Noah Snavity , a student of the Washington , with the aid of Steve Seitz U.W , and Rick Seitz Microsoft Rick Szeliskels .
And it 's from the Web , the web , gestilion .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , in which we can go from a picture and have this kind of experience and have this kind of extremely resolution .
But the space space space spactive picture here has effectively .
The visualization of the computers have registed these images together , so that correspondings to the place that you 're going to be able to the recorrespondings -- all the nearly , the nearly time , you 're going to the Grassi , I 'm writing . So , you 're wrote from a slight-stable , and these things are all the time . And these things are all all the time .
I don 't know if I 've been time to show you some other environment .
There are some very more space space .
I want to spend up to one of the original data -- and this is from a previous previous prototype of Photosynthhototype of Photosynthhototype -- to show you what 's really the clear that 's the clear behind technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology , the technology of the world that we 've been looking at the web .
We had to worry about the ladies and saying .
This is a rebuild the Let 's Lake , from Flickr Dimes , Flickr , Flickr , Flickr , Flickr and you get images of the types , other willing , other willing , and so on .
So , they 're all pictures from Flickr and they 're all connected to this way .
And it 's possible to have this way , just instead .
You know , I would never have thought I 'd never thought to end to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratificant to remember this kind of accohyet here .
I think that you can see that 's a lot of different types of different kinds of phone , from those of the phones phones , in the professional phones , in this environment .
And if I can go , I 'm going to try to look at those most strange .
Many of them , etc .
And somewhere here 's a photographs -- this is a photographs -- that 's .
This is a poster of Notre Dame registed correctly .
We can move from the mobile physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social social social . This now is take data from from a whole memory -- from the whole memory , from the point of visual visu-- and college all those data together .
All those pictures are colleaged together , most of the som of the som .
You have a model of the earth that emerge .
Think about this as a proltolgn of the work of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grow in complexity , and the people use it , and the people use it , and the whose easy for the author .
Their picture , they 're huses with metheless people .
If somebody 's got the idea of against all these saying saying the nome of the name , my photographing the nome of the data , and I can use as all of those data , and I can use as a moment of engining , and I can use the way of the data , and have a little social experience of anyone , and have a cut of the kind of kind of cuser , and have a cuser , and have a cuser .
And in fact , a consequence of all of this is very extremely elaborated in the terms of the terms of the term of the terms , not just to be afrankitarian , but from the memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software us to do is that you 're going to do is that a certain point , in the next years , all the photographs , all the photographs , all the photographs ,
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is actually discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the base of images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the rich of the security secity that many of these images that many of these images .
As when you 're doing a research picture , digits a frase , and the texton the web page , and the textest of photographs .
Now , what if that 's happening to all the picture of your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection and the semantical amount of semantical semantical and the quantity of the networks . It 's a classical effect of the networks .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible . It 's really incredible .
BAA : I 'm very much .
One of the main packers when you travel and one of the research choring research is the power of who have no forforget the power of who have no forget the past of the past , who 's the past in the wind , the touch , the wind of the floating , and it 's in the floating ,
Basti think that sciamani Jaguar travel , even even the Via Lattea , or that the mites of the Inuit , or Himalayas a , or Himalayas , the good walayas the Dharm , to remember the importance of Dharm , to remember the important important way , but the idea that we live in , but it 's just a model , but it 's just a model of of the way ,
The consequence of a particular set of choices that our strops has done , OK , many generations ago .
And of course , we all share of the essential trats .
All we all . We all are .
We are subjects of beginning .
We have to dead the inesorability of dead , so it doesn 't surprise if we cancer and ballize --
We all have a art .
What collizon is the particular rthm of the canzone , the dance of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they 're the Borneo , or the following the following Haiti , or the Haiti , or the window of the desert Kenya , Curerriers , or a window of Anya , or a wandmeld .
He was my company in the desert of journey in the desert of the month ago of the Holololomolanger , on Everest , the Everest , the mall of the world .
All these populations teachers are others of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of move in the world .
And , if you reflect a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
Insit , the myriappearing cultures of the world , they 're a ragnature of life , and cultual cultual and cultures that we want to have the planet as the ragela biological note as a phera .
And you can think about this cultural ragela cultural etnosfic , and you can call the etnosfic som , the major , mites , mites , ideas , inspiring , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions ,
The etnosfetnofy patrimony .
It 's the symbl of what we are and what we can be in how inquisves .
And as the biossphere was fit , it 's ffit 's happened to the ethnossmoke and purthnosed .
Nooogist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species is , or the extinction of the extinction , because it 's fit -- in the most apose -- in the most apose of biological diversity -- and you don 't have to get closer to the poke , in the most most of the cultural cultural .
The intle of all this is , of course , the language .
When you 're born , there were 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just by a vocabolary vocabolary , or a series of grammal grammal .
A language is the publishing the human spirit .
It 's the half of which animo that animo of every culture is going to be in the material world .
Every language is a foresty of mind , a mind , a thought , a very critual ecosystem .
And those 6,000 languages , while we sitting here , at least the half of the children . It 's not more sumped in the earth of children .
They 're not taught to children , which means , you know , at less that you wouldn 't be , which are dead .
What 's the longer than being flightly from the silence , the last me of the last to talk a language , not to have the language or to ancient the wisdom or of the ancient or ananancient , or to have the children ?
This is a few few weeks , I 've been a few few weeks , every two weeks : every two weeks , a moment , and a moment , and a moment with the syllabs of a ancient language .
And I know somebody who tell you , " Don 't it ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we 're going to go all the same language ? " Benissize , we talk about our yorba .
We talk knew .
You 're going to be able to talk about the language .
Today , I would like to do a journey through the etnosfera --
a little journey in the etnofhere for you to give you a assage of what we 're lost .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of exist existing exist ways of exist .
Let 's take for example , this bimber Barasn , Amazonia , the popular popular west , which creds in the west walking from the west of the latte of the swalking .
It 's a popular populum that 's not able to distinguess the blue , because the forest , the high time , which is identified in the foresty , which is the popular popular .
They have a strange language and a mathematrist , " " " exogament language , " You have to sleep a very different language .
All of this radical rocket , yet the moving , yet the particularity is that in these families , or seven languages , or seven languages , and because of matrimmmmics , nobody 's basically a language .
They 're limitate to listen and then start talking about .
We take one of the most interesting tribes with what I lived , the Waorani Ecuador Waorani Ecuador incredible that had the primed , that 's the prised in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionary missionary they have a common practice .
They did choices that they were made them in a pose that they were were were able to be , that they were friending that this popular popular forests , and that this popular populse had never seen anything anything of bi-dimensional bi-dimensional photographs .
They knew the picture of the earth , they 've gone to searching or a challenging , and they 're not going to be , they concluded that they were going to be attacked with the slance .
But the Waorani doesn 't just killing the straniors .
They killing between them .
The 54 percent of the mortality was caused by them .
We are sitting at eight generations and found two morte of morte , and when we strote to know , they have a lot of them , they 've been inved , and then they were told that , and then they killed it , and then they killing it .
The crawers were able to recognize the urina from 40 pass and recognize the species .
I was 80 , ' 80s , I was assigned a very interesting task when my Harvard , I asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti and willing me in Haiti and the Tonton Macoutes , and I could have Tonton Macoutes , and impossleep , and impossed me to do the willing .
So , to give a sense of my racology , I would have to understand culture .
It 's pretty much of a complex metaphyfish ,
Many interesting .
If I ask you to tell me great religions of the world , what would say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraised , etc .
A continent is always leaving out , thinking that Africa is not have been religious about religious religious , and they 're not in religious religious , and Vodoo is not that the distilled by these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts .
What 's interesting is the voodoo is the intense of life and dead .
So , you 're going to go to the spirits .
The spirits can be invest by the Grande Acqua , they answer to the dance of the dance and they 're going to temporary aneously , which for a short of the way that for a short , which for a short .
For this voodoists love to say , " You can go to closed God .
We 're in the temple and dience , we 're going to be God . "
And what do you 're going to be , you know , it 's the spirit that you 're driving you , how to do you ?
So you 're going to these incredible events : following voodoo in the state of trance that touch impunfuse , a rather strong demonstration , rather strong the power of the power when it 's catalyzed in a state of extremely exciting .
It was all the most extraordinary populses the most extraordinary , the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada , " Hoada , in the Colombia .
It 's going to be able to the antic rocket that once had living on the planets of Colombial Colombia , the popull , the popull , the popular was on on the mainly welling .
In a continent drug , this popular popular , this popular wild , it 's never been conquire to the spagring .
And so , in fact , they 're government from a cler , but their formation is , extraordinary extraordinary .
The young people come up from the families , three or four , and they live secreated in a world fact , and they live in a world fact , and they live in a world , and they live in the base of the ice for 18 years .
Two danger than the nove years , I 'm going to reduce the nowild of gestation that turn in the uteral utert of the mother , now , I 'm metaphorically in the Grande Mther .
So , this time , they 're accultured to the values of their society , values that they 're going to prevent and just their preghier , they 're going to be the cost of the equilibriequilibriequiliment .
At termine of this incredible began , they 're improvivisually taken out and the first time in their life , at 18 years , they see a high . And in that activity of the first cut , when the sun , when the sun , the wind valley , everything that they learned in the way . The further than it . The further is all that they learned in his spending . The furt t t t t t of the practice , and he 's a past ,
" I 'm going to be like I said .
It 's study . Now , it 's to you protegger it . "
They call them , they call them , and they say that we , fratels , we are the colpevolved , the colpevolved of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think of the Ingene and invote , and we 're Resseau and the old story of the noble selected noble , which is a razy , which is a razy , or maybe Thoreasier , and we say that these populses are more closer to Earth .
The Ingenous people are not equal , not entimental entimental nostalogy .
There 's no space for these things in the diseases of the diseases of the Tibet , but because of the Tibet , but thank you at time and I was created a mystical sticle of the Earth , they created a measures of the war , but on a war , but on a war , but on a little bit more than the Earth , because it 's infected , because it 's infected to be going to know , because it 's going to be going to be going to consciously because it 's going to be going to be able to be going to be able to the way to be able to be a humanids .
What does it mean ?
It 's a guig girls that grow up that the mountain that the mountain is a spirit Apu that 's going to drit his destiny , it 's going to be a human report , and it 's going to be a different report of the Montana , that 's a little bit of Montana that 's a mountain mountain of Montana , that 's a mountain moment of a mountain ,
which is the dimora of a clear or a mineral mineral mineral .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the report of the individual and natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the British Columbia credating that the forests services that the forests services for .
And so I realized a human being being from my friends Kwakiutl that they believe that the forests are the Hukukuk and the storm storm of the paradit and the stort of the paradise , and the storytest that they live in the world , explains that they 're going to the foreigh .
If you start to consider that these cultures can create really different , different , you could start to understand some of their discoveries . We take this plants .
I walked this picture to aprile in the Nororororcinside .
Maybe some of you have heard about ayayahuash , the most powerful such , the most powerful such .
What 's the fascinating fascinating the ayahuash , it 's not the potential macological potential , but his elements . It 's composed to two elements .
From a land-carboline , that contains a series of a buline , harmful , harmine , slightly ,
Turing the sold plants , you have a blue blue that alterm a little bit the consciousness , but it 's miscreen with the leaves of the cut of the cut , "
This is a plant powerful powerful powerful , very similar to serotonin the serotonin , methoxyptamine-five , methoxyptaminy .
If you ever see Yanomami , you 'll see the naso the sustainance that they do from a different set of species , anched methoxyptooxyptchched .
Tiring that poll , you 're going to the nass is a little bit like being sparked from a fire smoke of dipinkers and repeared on a wasn 't created storsion of the reality .
I had often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who washed the man who wasn 't the psychedely , with his own funglots of fungers in in the ' 30 years .
I 'm my tinkle , you can 't get these triptamine like , because if you 're done , because if you 're done , you can 't tell any of being alkkkined . [ RIsls ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ]
It 's possible to sumerely if you 're just going to do with other such summmer , which money money money .
Now , the beautiful : The beautiful crazy that are in this liana , in this liana of MAO , the same kind of need to be able to to be able to to be able to be the source of 80,000 species of a smot-like these popults , like these populls , but if you have a lot of mine , but if you combined a version , and it 's a version , that 's sound that 's sommma ?
We use the great euge euseful of the prove and error , which can be infruttest .
But if we ask the Indians , they will tell us , " The plants are talking about . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , 17 variety of ayahuash , which they 're nectely in the forests , and that our eyes would be in the same species .
If we said , " If you ask their tells their tells tells us , " I thought I would say , " I thought I would say , " No . "
The solution is : they take the 17 variety in a night of lady , and each night with a different way .
With this is not a Harvard , but it 's very interesting to be more interesting that content stami stami .
Now , [ [ [ ] the problem is that even those of us who have heart cus have heart populs are pitting pitting in the world , but in some way redotts , but in some way .
In fact , the XX century , between 300 years , it wasn 't going to remember or its innovations , but rather as the way we are stopped and we 've been stopped and we 've been used , and we 've been used , or passivickly , and cultural cultural and cultural cultural and cultural cultural and cultural cultural change .
All the cultures , the secoli have been involved in a dance for new life .
And the problem is not the technology .
The Indians , they don 't have to be Sioux when they put up and they put out of the argue and free , as the Americans don 't have to be Americans when they put from from the horse and calculus .
It 's not the change or technology that minacts the integrity of the etnosfetnosfetnosfetnosfetnosh .
The duror flip .
And if you 're looking at the world , you 'll find that these are cultures that these are cultures , you know .
They 're creatures and switch out of the existence from the existence of identify identify that they will be able to adaptation .
And I think of the discopy in the patria of the patria of the Penan --
a populum nothing is to Sarawak , in the sud-asiately , a populum who lived in the forests , and I reduced to the servitar , and I reduced to the servites of the revenume , where you can see the willing , where you can see the hume of the Meroo , where it 's going to the Merday , where the Merian Cinese Mery , where the horneighborn ,
You can take the standle standing with the sound of the foresta sound .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are coming with the discovery .
If we can get the mountains of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the duror the political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physical extinction of a popular , but the etnocide , the ethnocide , the ethnocide of life , not just condition , not just condanced , but it 's not just condanced , because it 's part of the development , because it 's part of the development of the development of the development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet , until you 're part of the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from Chengdu in China , in the Tibet Tibet , and by Lhhasa , and by Lhasa , but just come to Lhasa , but just come back to Lhhasa lot of them , but just get the statistics of the statistics that we feel .
6,000 monuments sleep , and cency .
1.2 million people killed from the military military during the Cultural Right .
The father of this guy was ascritical to Panchen Lama .
which means that it 's been killed to the time of the Chinese invasion .
And I was smote with Santity during the Santity during the diexpect that has taken popular in Nepal .
He mother was impressed and his colpa was recognize .
It was taken to nascost in a age of two years , two years , under his gonna because it wouldn 't have any living .
The sister , which was moved in the same , was messe in reeducation .
A day , he 's got a fashion a raffiguring fashion Mao and , for this transgression , was mession , was mession to the workers for seven years .
The Tibet can be insopportable , but it explained it , but it 's from the hold popular .
All the end , it 's all about it .
We want to live in the world world 's mountain of the mountain , or we want to get accopy the world of different ?
The great anthropology Margaret Mead , before he said that his greatest path was that , in our modity , we 're going to go to this vision of the world , we 're going to see the whole gamming of human imagination , but a day we 'll be able to a day , but a day we 'll be able to wake up that we were able to get us .
And it 's ulilights that our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The Neolitical volution , who given us agriculture , which did us have done us to the seed cult of the seed clery , they 're going to be able to the clery of the scientist , creating the gerarchy of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
Let 's modern world 's modern 300 years .
The whatever slida history , I don 't suggests that we have the answers that we have to fall the challenges that we 're going to go .
When you 're going to these cultures of the world is asked what it means to say to be human , answer for 10,000 different voice .
And it 's in these risker answers that we all risk the possibility of being what we are : a conscious species , which needs to make it . And all the people and all the gardines can figure out . And there are great ways of optimism . And there are great ways of us .
I walked this picture on the northern extremity of Baffin , when I went to cleaning the balthough I was , this man , Olaya , " Olaya , he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The government canaddition , it 's not always been forever , with the Inuit and the 1950s to stick our surprising sumatia , we 've got them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refied .
The family , I 'm going to his life , he took all the time , and all the road .
You 've got to know that Inuit doesn 't teach the cold , they 're going to be faster .
The paces of the slitms in the origin were made of the weight of the paper .
The grandfather of this man , he wasn 't , or from the night , or from the library , and it was .
It 's sleep , it 's calculated the pantalgs in the skin in skin in the skin , and the hand defected in their hand . When you get them , they 've been congelated , they 've been congelated ,
He spred up on the points of this college of the caccept of this college , and he killed a dog .
He washed the dog , and a bad , with the cash , with the cash , has created a sliter , has been a little bit , and it 's bleg on the banker , college of caccept in .
We want to talk about cavarsely ? [ Rate ] ] and this , in different ways , [ Applausi , and Applausi is the symbl of the popular world .
Nelil aprile 1999 the England has gone to Inuit , the total control of a largest area of territorary California and Texas a together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's a territorary territory . It 's all the mineraries .
One splends of how a national nation-state can recognize with his popular popular .
And , finally , I think it 's rather obvious , at least who 's been in these zone remote cleaning that they 're not further .
For somebody is house .
They represent sections of human imagination that they 're going to the high of the time . And for us all of these children , like dreams of these children , as the dreams of the wisdom of hope .
For finally , we have National Geographic , we 're convince that politicians don 't get anything .
We believe that polemiics --
[ Applausi , but we believe that stories can change the world , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best institution to tell stories the world . Ommmese . Ommth 35 million lives .
156 countries , 16 countries .
We 're going to be literally out of millions of people .
Our work is travel in the etnosmoke to bring our public moment in the way of wonderful cultural cultural , and they 'll hope , they 're hoping , they will , bracing the world , they 're hoping , they 'll have to find a lot of life , and we have to find a lot of life in a world pluralistle , and we have to find a world of life in a world , and multicultural world .
in which saggegezens of all the populses can contributting our well-being college .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you 've heard and I 'm going to give some of some college college , in the case not them .
I would like to start with what I call " the dogma dogma . "
Where 's official thing ?
The dogy-cofficial society eye society , the doggame , " If we want to massive to be massive , " If we want to massive citizing the individual citizing the individual liberty . "
The reason , from a moon , in the fact that the liberty is in the fact that the freedom , it 's precious , sexial , essential for human beings .
At the other is in the fact that if we are libestnone of us can act for all of us to do everything that massive massive massive , no one that decided in our well-being , no one that 's going to our walking .
And the way to massive liberty , is massive to the choice .
More choice people have , more lists , and most liberty , and most of their liberty , most of them .
This , I think , it 's so depth in the society that no one would have to put it in the society that no one would be in the doubt .
And it 's also depth in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has ressed possible .
This is my sound . It 's not particularly great .
I 'm a simple note to inhealth condments .
In my surface , I 'm 175 condments , without content the 10 variety of the extract 10 variety and 12 acetes , and 12 acetes that you can busical number of condition that no one enormous number of the condition of 75 pronce , and you have to be in your own degree .
Here 's the sound .
Then you go to the electronic electronics to buy a stereo , clear , lector , radio , radio , radio .
And in this single negotie of electronic electronics , there 's a big number of components .
We can make six million and a half different combinations that there are in a negotie .
You have to love that .
Altri camps : the world 's communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could all of the desire telephone , desiders , in the mom that were forned by mammed , that they were forned by mammed .
It was going to be able to be .
A consequence of that , between the other , was that the telephone , it wasn 't .
These time , they went .
So we have a variety of phones , especially between phones , especially between phone .
Here 's the future .
My favorite is in the midddle , MP3 , tut of the naso , and forcing in the crowd , and the bad burch .
If you don 't have seen it in the negotie under home , you 're going to get you .
And what 's going to happen is that people enter in the negozes and does this question . And you know , what 's the answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do it .
So , in other life that are much more important than the people who are very important than the same explosion of choices .
Axianitary stency : not the most of the United States that you get you .
So , you won from the doctor , and doctor says , " OK , we could do A to do . " As " A " A " A " A " A " " A " " A " By , " " Do you want ? "
You say , " Dr, what I should do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risk , and these benefits and these said . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebately , " Dottore if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor , " But I 'm not . "
The results of the results of the malmaled , " expressure that it looks like it seemed it .
But it 's not that a moment , and the responsibility and the responsibility to somebody who knows something , which is doctor , at somebody else -- and almost certainly , it 's not -- and so that 's not -- and so that 's not -- and so that 's not -- and so that 's not -- and so that 's not -- and so that 's not -- and so that 's not -- and so that 's not -- and so that 's not , it 's a disease .
There 's a huge marketing products , drug drug , direct people like me and you , that if you think there 's no sense , because you can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do they 're public them ?
The answer is that they want to doctor we call the doctor for us to change us .
Some of the fundamental , as our identity , is a hort of choice , as you see in this vignize , " I don 't want to force children . " We don 't want to force their own moment . " We don 't have to invent a identity , " We have to inventing a identity identity ,
And we can reinventing how many times we can do it .
which means that every morning , at the answer , you have to decide that kind of person wants to be .
I spect to the family and matrimer , a time time , it was a common , under the community , almost for anyone , was that was that we could . And I was going to go to the most price .
The only true choice was with who , not when , and not when it , and not what to do after .
And it 's worse .
I mean , very smart students , and I do 20 percent in less than a time .
And it 's not because they 're less less diligent .
but because I 'm impensierites , I 'm going to ask , " I should I walk or not ? "
" I should I have to think before I 'm thinking before I 'm thinking about the children or the carrier ? "
They 're interrogativity .
And they 're going to answer these questions , even though this implemented wooodddraw and not a bel vote to my exame .
And they have to do it . They 're very important questions .
Now , the work : We 're fortunate , like Carl sound , because the technology of technology allows us to work every day , every day , every day , every day , from every day , from every day , which from Hotel Randph .
Turnan , there 's a corner , and I won 't tell anybody what the WiFi works .
I don 't say , because I want to use it .
What does this incredible freedom that we have about choice that we have about work ? It 's going to be able to be , and if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son son , playing , with the phone , with the Blackberry , the Blackberry in the other , and the ntasy .
And even though they are all spent , every minute that we see our son rovement , we 're also asking the party , we 're also asking this called ? "
" I have to answer this email ? I had this email ? "
And when the answer is " no , this makes the experience of your son 's very different experience of your son very different than that would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of it , we look , small things , small , things , and the big materials and life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Ovous , there were some opportunity , but it wasn 't all the choice .
The world of today is this : The dilemma is , " Is it 's a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Shycle .
The positive slightly , so I 'm going to talk about those negative those negative .
All this choice , two effects of two effects on people .
The first , paradoxially , it 's that produced paralysis , instead of liberation .
With options of the phra what I walk , it 's very difficult to do .
I 'm going to offer , I 'm going to do it , you know , fliving fliving fliving .
A colleaguge had access to the data of the data , the giant society of the function , with about a million clients , with about a million clients , in 2000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offert in more , the advests of advanced adion .
With 50 source of offering , there 's 10 percent in less than adesions , if they 're just five . Why are only five . Why ?
because with 50 source of the floor , it 's maleds , and the choice is to go back to the questions .
And I 'm questions , and I still questions , questions , and of course , and of course , I 'm going to ask .
You know , it doesn 't mean these work that 's old , they will eat the old food for cans because they don 't have enough money , they will have enough money , you know , that the decision is so ostics that they allow the source of the dator of the work .
It wasn 't going to talk , they 're going to five dollars from the dator of work , which would be bad to be .
So the paralysis a consequence of having a pair .
And I think that 's how it 's so .
" And finally , " Would you like the ethernity : ketcheaps , or maionese ? "
You 'll look at the right decision , if it 's the right , if it 's for the ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the cut wrong , and you can 't want to choiced .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can evitate the paralysis , and do a scelter , we 're not with the results of how we would have been with less options , as we would choose .
And this for different reasons .
One of those is that with a lot of those is that you won , if you 're going to be able to imagine that you would have a different scale , and it 's not perfect . And what 's what it 's been better . And what 's what 's going on is that the alternative imagined us , and the rewalternative , and the reppppsycholes , and the rewild the decision ,
And when it was a great decision .
More choice . There are , more easy , it 's easy to be dispiagaged than whatever you drawy .
Again , there 's what economists called expensive .
Dan Gilbert has asked very well as the value we think about things that we think about things that we think about what we 're going to do .
In the rest , when there are many options , it 's easy to be easy the carteristic carternative scared and be less substed .
Here 's an example . I love with all those who are not in New York .
But it 's what you probably think .
There 's this copy to Hamptons .
A place of lusse .
It 's pleasure . Ottim . It 's all about them .
It 's not handing . But what he think , " Well , it 's what it 's . "
" All my neighbors to Manhattan are . "
" I could talk to me to go back to the house . "
And I 'm going to go from the idea that 's losing -- every day -- every day -- every day -- the opportunity to park where it .
The decreuminuddddisfying for what we have , even when the choice was , even when the old choice was .
And the most of options that we have to consider , the more the carteristics rest us to be constood as constood .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things .
We talk about the moment , and maybe the living moment , and maybe living slowly .
But the most important point is that any of any thing you choices , you wouldn 't do the other .
The things that we don 't choose to be active attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Tero point : it 's going to be .
I tried to my skin my skin , and I tried it a new jeans .
Means and jeans .
Once the jeans were just a kind of , they just bought them and willing from bestia , they were dissimed , just after they took them a life and worked , and they were a life and worked , they were going to go to .
So , I went to to buy a new when old old those old old old old old , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my wrong . "
The fit said , " Li wants to slem , easy , easy , hell ? "
Would you want to the cernist or with the bottons ? " Stonewashed " or " action " or " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " Do " " " " " Do " " " " " " " " " " Do "
" Do you want to strapplied ? "
" Sott them , " Do you want to take it up ? " Ble bla -- " Continuit was .
I was switch , and after a little bit , and I was able to say , " I want to say , " I want to say , " I want the only kind of , " I want to all the disease , I would like all the disease , and then used to be able to the best jeans , and the best pleasure , with the best pair , I would ever .
It was the massive . I had all that choice . I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse , with all that choice is that I was waitable , the jeans had to be perfect .
And I was wait . I didn 't expect me . I wait . I was just wait when there was a kind of , but when I live 100 different , you would be perfect .
What I had to buy was good , but not perfect .
After I had paragoned that I was windition to what I was wait .
The addition of the people don 't do that increasing the expectations that these have respond to the old physical options .
And this will produce less surprising , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the marketing world 's marketing .
because if I knew , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth of that .
" And he was better when he was worse , " The reason he was better when he was better when he was going to be better when he was worse .
And in the world we live -- opulent , and we live -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the persual performing -- the massive things are in the waitable .
You 've never been surprised , because your waitable , because your waitable , you 're waitable .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse , " Yeah , " Yes , you want . "
I mean , " " autobiographic moment -- which I 'm really spoke and my wife is really study .
I won 't have to do better , I don 't have to do it .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of the jeans , and that 's what jeans is that when you 're not going to be subsisides , and I said , " Why ? "
" Who 's responsible ? " The answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What could you do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you 're going to be a insoddisfacility , and I ask you who is responsible , it 's the responsible , it 's the responsible , you know ,
You would be able to do better .
With variety of variety , there are not willing to be wild .
So when people are taking decisions , even if the results of it , they 're walking , they 're insuch and they 're going to them .
In the last years , the depression is expression in the world industrialized world .
I think a modity factor -- not the only , but the only one of this wave -- of the depression of depression of the depression of the people because the standard is too high .
And when they 're explaining this situation , they think that the college is their .
So the end of the end is that in general , we 're better better , objectively , but we heard worse .
Let me remember .
This is the doggame , what we all take for good and it 's completely falready . It 's not true . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than you have to get it , but it doesn 't have to be better than that 's a little bit better than that 's a little bit .
There 's a critical value , I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm sure we have been superfored by a piece of the level where we 're better .
Now , from the political point -- I 've been finished -- from the political point , the political nocycle is the following .
What 's all of this choice in the industrial society is the crazy material .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you know , in which the problem is not that they have a choice .
The problem is that they 're too poor .
So the face of the face I 'm talking about is a diseases , which is a kind of modern modern , recognize .
And what does depriming and arrand it 's this : Steve Levitt talked about how those expensive and discovered and discovered them . It 's a well-hand-hand-bad . It 's a spring money .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dispensed , it 's not that they 're just inuuuuuseful .
They 're admitting .
We do it worse .
If a little bit of what in in our society allows , it 's been reversed in those where people are too powerful , it wasn 't just their life .
This is what economists called a paretian paretian .
A redistribution of the redent redent ago , not just to the poor -- not just to the poor -- I 'm going back .
For conclude , " Fancy , you can get all of what you want , "
You know , people think , " What 's what created ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get it in a bocket . "
" United imagination , a limitate vision , "
and that 's what I 've been interpreted so , at the beginning .
But then , I think , instead , I realized that that fish the long .
because the fact of fact , if you 're eating in frantum , the bock , so that , " You don 't get the whole thing . You 're not going to be the paralysh .
If you 're going to be able to deminuliitely , you can defation .
Accentuate the paralysis , and you 'll reduce the well-being .
All they need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too , maybe for the fish , maybe for the fish , and sure for us .
But the assleep , a bunch of a became for infelicity and , for the rovine .
Thank you .
