I 've shown these slides to show that the glacial calots to show that the arct glacial , which for almost three million years had the size of 48 percent of the United States , is referrups of the United States , is repected by 40 percent .
But this is the underlying gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice .
The arct of the artical calots is , in a certain sense , the heart of the global climate system .
It expanding , you expand it reverse .
The next slide is going to be a quick card on of the last 25 years .
The ice perends are signed in red .
You see , you 're going to expanded up to the blue .
That 's the ice in winter , which is reverist of summmer .
You can see that the ice is the blood lost lost , of five years or more , it 's like the blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like the blood of the body .
In 25 years , it 's been so , in 25 years , so .
This is a problem because the warming is the interest in the ice of the ice , around the ocean , where there are huge amount of coal coal that , the huge amount of coal congeled that , the microbes are turned into metrics .
I reply to the totality of the atmospherical totality , that quantity could double , super-scale .
In some laghs in some deep in Alaska , the metano is already rebulating on the water .
The professority Katey Walter of Alaska , the University of Alaska team , a team taken up a team .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You 're good .
A reason is that this term exchange is that that 's a termal exchange from the northern Greenland .
This is a glacial river .
His a down-like levels .
This is the Kangerlusaq , in the west souast of the Greenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea level of the melt of the sea level , here it 's where it reaches .
These corrups are increasing quickly .
On the other part of the planet : Antarctop-up , the largest blop of the planet .
The last month of the scientists have gone that the gap of the ice is in negative , and the Antarctica , which pogets on some submarine islands , which poor on some submarine islands , is particularly quickly .
It 's six meters of the level of the action , like Greenland .
On Himalaya , the largest blop of ice , you see new ice , which is a few years ago , which few years ago were glaghi .
Fith-percent of the world population will be in the water as a population as the melt .
Sull Ande : this glacier is the source of the city of this city .
The ported is increased .
But when it decrease , the same happens to the same access to the water .
In California the snow on the Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
Bididrics are in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , are graves .
The growth of the world 's powering in the world 's crazy to a remarkable increase incenden .
The environmental disasters are increasing a return out of the normal and without precedented .
Four times more numerous times over the last 30 years than 75 .
This is a listening of all insustainable .
If you look at it in the historical context , if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of tons of CO2 every 25 million tons of tons in the oceans every day .
Look attentially the Eastern Pacific , from the American , to the west , and both wild the west , where there 's a radical imor of the oxygen in the oceans .
The greater causes of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuel combustiable .
Oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the most emissions with China , together at China .
And he was proposed to build a lot of other central coal .
But we 're seeing a change of direction .
These are annothing in the last few years and some proposes to alternative proposes .
Everything is , there 's a politics in our country .
The coal industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the last year for promote coal , which is a bunch .
And that picture of something --
Natal , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion gallons of coal scories .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the largest flow of scories in America .
It 's happened around the Natal .
The nature of cococoal advertising of one was this coal .
Video : â™« Frosty the carbon , is a happy , and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it grow our economy .
Frosty carbon is and more public .
It 's a good price , adorable , and workers are keeping the styptic .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest minerary society is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima 's Protection launched two campaign .
This is a part of it , one part .
Video : Atter : Actor : Actor , we see the climate change change as a serious minreat our business .
For this is our priority to be a great amount of money in a such a great public public and confused truth and confused truth .
In fact , coal is not sports .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good provide .
So not preoent preod-climate change .
Let do it .
Video : Atter : Carbon -- you 've heard a lot of them talking very much .
So , let 's let 's go to a turn into a structure of the coal , as it is about coal .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noise , but this is the sound of the technology of coal coal technology .
The coal consumption is between the major of global warming , but the night technology of coal warming , but the remarkable technology of coal , you see a likely .
Date a look .
Al Gore : Finally , positive alternative alternative to economic security and the national security .
Video : Comvice : America is in the crisis , national security , national security , climate crisis .
The floor that the bottom of all : our dependence from the fossil fuel , like the coal and oil .
Now , there 's a new audace , a new audace solution for it .
Repower America : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work , make us more sure , and help us stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that you were solving our problems .
Repower America . Scover more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's about reward energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to get to the dependence on the dependence that they killed the planet .
It 's what the future is here . Vine , sole , a new energy network .
It 's two : Noves investment for good job reported .
Comprint : Repower America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old African tanks , " If you want to go fast , go to the fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
I 'm going to TED to do it in the LHC .
And I promise to address you on how the machine works .
So here I am . And for the other time . And the other time , there were no LHC scientific experiment ever -- 27 kilometers of circumference .
His task is to remember the conditions that were less than a billion by the beginning of the universe -- until the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
All of this is just environment .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
We 're pictures these mini-Big Bang Bang in the remarkable .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLATLATLAS -- is 44 meters and a diameter of 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions .
Ten September last year we got the machine , we have accesered the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was causes of immense to festern control in the control room .
It 's a picture of the first particles that had done all over the LHC , entering collision , by collision , by a part of the LHC , and spread particles into the remarker .
In other words , when we saw that image 10 , the machine was going to be , we found that machine worked , which is a great vitter .
I don 't know if this was this to do us exultent us or this , when someone went on Google and saw the page was this .
That means we had a cultural impact on beyond that scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to these dorry dored here -- these dorry dored dorry .
These files are taking 13,000 amps when the machine works at the power of power .
Now , the technicians between you are looking at the boys and say , " It 's not true . I 'm too hard puts . "
And they can do it because when they 're very cold becomes the superconducts .
So at less 271 degrees , at a lower temperature to the wore of the space between stars , these files can bring that crowd that crowd .
In one of the guntures of the most novemile magnetes in LHC , there was a fabrication .
So the files are surremarkable to slightly , and the 13,000 amps of the electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think these magnets have more than 20 tons , and that have been moving over 20 tons , and that they were moved about 30 cents .
They 're damaged about 50 magnetic .
We had to take them , what we did .
We restined and address .
Now they 're back to all the time to their place on the ground place .
And it finally , the least of march .
We 're going to accinate it , and we expect to get the data of the data or June , and keep so our adventure to discover what the morning for the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents reacting the debate on science and engineering in science and engineering . It 's easy to confer .
I think the fact that 's so hard , the fact of going to go beyond the limits , I think it 's the value of things like the LHC .
I want to end with the words of a Ingent scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I imagine , in defense experiments of his puple , the ple puple ble was Michael Faraday , " " Nient is so dangerous for the progress of human mind , which is not so dangerous for the progress of human beings , which is not in nature , which our triple worlens are new worlds , and that 's not completely new worldanger .
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to rethink about when children , you 're going to be played with the morning .
While you understand how you reach them and you 're going to get them , and get them , to learn how to think and solving problems and solving problems that it 's going on and manipulating relationships .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , from information information , inspired by the uses of our physical objects , together to my consult Patts , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask me , " And if we use a computer , instead of the digital polar pastry that moves on a desktop of the digital polluter that moves on a desktop information with both hands on a desktop ,
and we 're going to sistems ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siften interactive computer interactive as a big cook-site computer interactive .
In a few words , a Siften interactive computer interactive as a big cook-site computer interactive .
You can move with the hand , they can see , they can see the motion between them , and they have a radio and a radio screen and a radio radio .
But it 's most physical objects , like the morning , you can just move to just squeeeasy .
Siftable is a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as it is more physicists , conscious of their motion , of the other , and as they become more physicists , conscious , of the right motion , of how we move , we can explore new and different styles of interaction .
I 'm going to start with a few simple example .
This Siften is configurated to show video : if it 's in a direction , the video whether it 's going to go back to the other side .
These interactive rats are aware of other people .
If I do it , you 're interested in what they 're around .
If they are circummits , they notice it and they can act a little bit .
If they are circummits , they notice it and they can act a little bit .
They have been also the their motion and inclination .
And then I realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power of the data , for example , to put " a color like a color like a color like a color like a color like a color .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurated as a seck and I can use them to color in that color in the city , where they missing .
and I can use them to bring them of color in that central , where they missing .
If we 're too much , we can reach a little bit .
You are also beautiful possibilities of learning , like languages , the mathematics and games where people can try to try and see the results of the result , and see the result of the immediately .
Now , I 'm --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a equations program .
Here we have a word of words that 's half between Scarabeo and Boggle .
Pratically , at every turn on a letter on every Siften , Pratically , at every turn on a letter on every Siften letter on to every Siften , and while you 're trying to buy words him on a direction .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you have a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came to the Media Lab , I did so that they tried them and I took a video .
They were very much .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people many education .
You 've got to say , " Comptions of words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's how other people who are trying to it .
This is our younger header header , on the right .
It really wanted to impact them .
They were only bring in the morning , for him .
Now , this is an interaction of a cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of languages is Felix .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving the Siften , they sold the Siften .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving the Siften , they sold the Siften .
So it 's doing it out .
Video : The sun is surprigend .
David Merrill : Now , he took a tractor in the scene .
Video : The arange treator .
Bkkkkey !
So I school with Siftable and put them close to interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
and by inventing their own .
Video : Can !
DM : It 's a story with the open open open , and it can decide him as it .
DM : It 's a story with the open open open , and it can decide him as it .
Video : Voly , right .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool , recently , to walk and execting music .
It 's a tool , recently , to walk and execk music .
Siftable here are such as well , basically , basically , battery and bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also be insert these sounds in a sequence to you get your feeding .
And it 's just going to make it a sound , and a sequence .
These are effects that you can control from the live and filter .
I 'm attacked to a particular sound and then including it .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , which are applying the entire sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : DM : We 'll start putting a base in two Siftable , " sequence , " we 're going to get it into a series , we add the base .
Now I put a line .
Video : DM : I 'm going to add of percussion --
Video : DM : And I 'm going to put the battery , so I can control the effect from the live .
DM : DM : DM : I can fly the entire sequence to inclinking the time by one side or the other .
Video : DM : And I 'll add the filter to the bottom to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can recombine the sequence " to fly . "
So I don 't have to plan it first , but I can improvisate , make it longer or more corta .
And now , finally , I can fump the entire sequence inclinking to the Siftable to Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new murdering men interface more more more than our brain and the body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the result of this lost , and even some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to turn is that new generation of the new projects for interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writer .
I 'm writing books is my profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and the love of my life .
And I don 't expect to be that .
But , he said this , something particular happened in my life and my career , who took me to me the whole life , and I brought the entire relationship to this job .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called " Mangic , Prega , Ama , " which , diversity , for some reason , for some reason my books , for some reason that I was going to be a big sensational , bestself-interaction .
And the result is that everywhere I go now , people treat me as if I were convicted .
Did -- convicted , convicted ,
They 're now now worried and say , " Don 't you fear that you 're not afraid to do it ?
You don 't afraid to keep writing for all life without more more able to create a book that can important someone ? "
what can it important to someone ? "
It 's very remarkable , you know .
But it could go worse , part of that I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent adolescent -- I was a writer .
I 'm going to meet the same reaction by fear .
And people say , " Don 't temes I could not have success ?
Don 't you fear that the umiliation of the refer killed ?
Don 't you afrankly to do this all life without that nothing is ever outside and die on a cumouth of a drawl cumouth of fallies with the full of fallisment ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short is , " Yes . "
Yes , I afraid of all those things .
I 've always had afraid .
And I also afraid of many other things that people could not have .
Like the algae and other things .
But , how about it is to write the what I thought and wondered to me , is why ?
It 's rational ?
It 's logical that anyone who has to expect to be spended by a job that you feel to do .
But what 's there so particular in the creative impress to make us nervous health health health health health , other people do not ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember a only in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he fear to be engineer ?
Don 't it -- that block of John 's engineer , how is it ?
Don 't work that , you know ?
Onestically , chemical engineers like group , they don 't certainly have certainly , in the reputation of being alcoholed .
We have enough to writers , we have enough this reputation , and not only creative writers , we have this reputation of being huge .
And it doesn 't do anything else to look at the sad of the deaths of the perspective of creative perspective , only in the century , they died young and often for them .
And the ones that are not suicipate data that they 're really disfaced by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before I die in the last interview , he said , " Every my book killed me a little more " " " " extraordinary affermation is about the work of their life .
But we don 't buy the time we feel that because we heard these things that we 've heard these things that we 've completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering the notion that creativity and the art , at the end , will be going to be able to draw .
And the question I want to bring everybody to today is : you agree with this idea ?
It 's good to be -- because they also watched by a centimeter , it 's not good for anything to suppose this supposed .
I think it 's hath .
And I think it 's even dangerous and I don 't want to see it perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encourage our great creative minds to live .
And I certainly know that , in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start at the end dark supposed to the beef supposed , especially to be in my career .
That 's really -- you look at that , they 're pretty young , I 've been about 40 years .
I 've still got about four decades workers in me .
And it 's very likely that whatever I write about now is going to be judged by the world as the work that I was going to go out to my last book .
I 'm going to be slater , because we 're all more or less friends here -- is likely that my greatest success is my greatest myes .
Oh , Gesus , who thought .
You know this is the gender of thinking that brings a person to start to get gin the nine morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would like to keep doing this job that we love .
So , the question is , how do it ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflections , that the way to work to keep write is to create a psychological cougical coures , OK ?
I have to find some way to find a security between me , which I 'm written , and my natural anxiety on which I 'm wrote to what I started to look at the time , trying to get the other societies of how to do it , I started looking through the time , trying to find other societies to see whether they could have the best ideas and more healthy sought-sane ideas and more healthier
about how to help creative people to manage the inherent inherent inherent people of creativity .
And that research took me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
Sem because it turns out to the circle and then turn back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity was giving from men , OK ?
It was creativity to be this beautiful severe and that was that they were wine humans from a few source source and unknown , for the high reasons and unknown .
The greeek is called these spirits of creativity of creativity " demons . "
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a demand elargive .
Romanes were the same idea , but they called that sort of spirit without a genius .
And that 's great , because the Romans didn 't really think that a genius was someone particularly intelligent .
They believe that a genius was this kind of entities that created an entities literally lived in literally in the walls of a artist , a little bit like the elfer Dobby , and that came out to be able to be to hold the job of the artist and actually actually actually actually , the result of that job .
Except -- here 's the distance of which I talk about -- that 's the psychological cousual that you protective from the result of your work .
And everybody knew that was so that it worked , right ?
So the anti-to-certain artists were protected by certain things , like the too narcial , right ?
If your work was exciting for your job , you could 't take all the good-up , everybody knew that was helped by this genius .
If your failure job , it wasn 't all your lift , right ?
Everyone knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so the han people concept creativity in Western Western for a long time .
And then Rinascient came and everything changed , and it was born this big idea ; we put human being to the middle of the universe on the universe and the mysteries and no longer leave space to make the devices that write by the divinity .
This was the rational of the rational humans and people started to think that creativity was completely from the idivide .
And for the first time in history , he started to refer to this or that artist as a genius as a genius as a genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think I allow somebody , a simple person to believe , a simple person who is like a recient as a source , the essence and the source of all the divines , creative , unknown and ethern responsibility to the humans .
It 's like to ask someone to inguys the sun .
Dego and completely the ego and creates all these inherent ingestion and creates these high lost .
And I think it was this pressure to have been this pressure to have artists in the past 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think it 's true , and now ?
Can we do it fun ?
Maybe back to a more ancient comprehension of humans and creative relationship .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of rational thinking in a talk of 18 minutes .
And there is probably people in the audience that would sold suspicians on the notion of scientific notion , you do , you do , you do , you do follow the people on their projects .
I 'm probably not to convined you all about this .
But the question I would like to bring is -- why not ?
Why not think that way ?
Because it has more sense of everything that I ever heard to explain the exasperant impreve-driven impreve-driven process .
A process that , as anyone who ever ever ever loved to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- knows , everybody here -- knows , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , basically , everyone here -- it 's not compared rationally .
And in fact , it can sometimes it seemed completely paranormal .
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poetetetetesis , which has 90s , but it was a poeteter for all life and told me that during his childhood in the Virginia , working out in the Virginia , and he felt it , in the poor , when a poor was in the poor .
He said she was like a fragorous air track .
And it was rotated to the landscape from the landscape .
He felt it to get it , because she was so much .
He knew you had one thing to do at that point and it was , words , " run as a math . "
And so it goes to home and he was going to go to this poetry , and it wouldn 't have to make a piece of paper and a match and a fast cut matched , while the transapared , and sleeping it on the page .
Sometimes he couldn 't be fast , so it 's and run and run and run it and sat her and poetry her to the home and poetry her to go and her lost her and she would keep on the landscape , and he would keep on the landscape , and he said , " one poet another poet . "
Then there were the time -- this piece of time -- this piece I never forgot -- there were almost losing , OK ?
So , she was running at home and he was trying to paper and the poetry was going through , and he was a match in the way he was going to sleeping , and then she said , " He was like sleeping with the other hand the step .
And he was the poetry from the tail and put it into his body and turned it into his body and turned it on the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect page and intact , but on the last word .
So when I felt it -- it 's a crazy , it 's exactly equal to my creative process .
I 'm not a creative process -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a music , and my way to work is , and I 'm going to go to the himself every day and go and go go and go go on on and go on on it .
But I even in my headquarter , I 've striked against that thing , at times .
And I imagine that many of you , the han fact ,
You know , even if the job and ideas were given me from a certain source , I could 't lose honestly .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we do it to do it , so that we don 't do lose your head , but rather , rather , rather , that do you remain us ?
For how it is about it , the best example of the contemporary example I have is the Tom Micista , which I interviewed in a newspaper newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of life has been the incarnation of the artist record , trying to control , to run these kind of creative impulses of totally interized creative impulses .
But then I reverse , he was driving , and one day as he was driving on a car in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going to go fast and everything of a sent , this little piece of melody , which is coming into his head as an inspiration , electricity and straining , and you want , you know , you know , it 's wonderful , and the desider , but not as to take it .
It has no paper , has no paper , it doesn 't have a math , it has no register .
So it starts to feel this kind of old anxiety grow in him like , " I 'm going to lose it , and I 'll be obsessed by this song lost .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , they stop .
I 'm going to do the entire mental process and he did something completely new .
And he just look at the sky and said , " Scuses , you don 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" It seems to write a hour ?
If you really want to existing , you 're going to go back to a more opports when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you 're going to important somebody else today .
You go to the Leonard Cohen . "
And his work process to changed after this .
I don 't work , the job was still known as a always .
But the process , and the fish that was required when the genius was re-leaved when the genius , the genius , the genius that problems and fliberate it back to where they were , to remainly remainly inside where it was , and turned .
but it 's very much about this peculiar , beautiful collaboration a conversation between Tom and this strange thing that allowed and exterial , and this exterial and exterial , and this exterial , and exterial , and this exterial , and this exterial , and exterributing conversation between Tom and exterm is a conversation between Tom and this strange , and exterributing , and exterial , and
So , as the story is what I was going to change a little bit even how I worked and already was saved once .
This idea , I was writing , when I was writing " Mangian , Ama , and the falls in one of those cause of the disperation that we all cause when we 're working on something and we can 't start to think that it 's going to be a disaster , that 's going to be the worst book .
Not only bad , right , right the worst wrote .
And I started to think of gait .
But then I remember Tom that I talked to the air and I tried to us .
So I got up my face on the hand I recognize my hand I realized my hand my hand , I realize my hand ,
And I said to high voices , " What , " Well , we 're both known that if this book won 't be internal to be surprised to my , right ?
Because as you see , I 'm going to put it all I have , I don 't have any more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to present , and make your part .
OK . But if you do not , you know what , I don 't do .
I 'm going to writing the same because it 's my job .
And I would like to do it that I 'm recorded to do my part of the way , " Because -- at the end is so , OK -- at the end of North Africa -- secos ago in the North of Africa , people were sought-dances to the choly-shed music of sacred dances to the challenge and the albaby .
And they were always magnificent , because the ballerini were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every time , it 's really caught , and one of these artists became actually transendent .
And I know what I 'm talking about , because I know you all have seen it , at a point , a performance so .
It was like the time , and the dancing dancerine , and the ballery walked through a kind of population , and she didn 't have any different from the usually , but all of the 1,000 night before , but all the time .
And suddenly , it doesn 't appeared as a human .
But it 's accurate in the fire and under the fire in the fire of divinity .
And when this was happening , at the time , people knew what was , they call it with her name .
They knew the hands and started to sing , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God , Allah , God .
That 's God , you know .
He known note historical -- when Ms invaser the South , the Spain , I was this habitude with their and the pronounded and the chologies from " Allah , Allah , Allah , the role , " that you can still feel in the round or flames .
In Spain , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , " Allah , the role , Allah , magnificent , Brunning , " Buh , " ununderstandable , " " " " " " God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But the problem is coming the day after the ballery , when you wake up and discover that they 're the 11 of Martedyes and discover that 's the next to God 's not .
It 's just a mortal with bad for the ginock , and maybe it will never be able to get that alachia lot of the height .
And maybe nobody sleeping the name of God , while so on , and what 's going to do with her life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful recognization to make life .
But maybe it has to be so angoes so angosh if you can 't believe , involved , injumped , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being from you .
But you just believe that they 're just going to be data from a unimaginable source of this squisite part of your life that you have to get to somebody else when you ended .
And , you know , if we think it 's this whole changes .
And so I started to think , and it 's certainly like this , and it 's such as I thought , in a book that I 'm public , I 'm going to public , spectic , specast , I was existed by following my great success .
And what I have to keep to go and tell me when I feel elected by this is , not going to be done .
Don 't just give you . It 's just your work .
It 's a way to introduce you for your part , any way .
If your job is , bad at at the ball .
If the divine , you lide in the divine , you assigned a few kind of wonderful wonderful , for one moment through your effort , then , " Ole ! "
Otherwise , you do the same thing .
And " Ole ! " at yourself .
I think there and I think it has to teach it .
" On it ! " at yourself , even for the humans and heading for a living humans to make you keep up continuously .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : On !
And you know , I 've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can mean and discovery new set of genes .
Now we 're starting a new path : We started to digitalize biology and now now we 're going to go into a new biology , we 're entering in a new biology , design and synthesizing life .
We 've always been trying to get large questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists I think they 've been trying to understand and a livels .
We tried different approaches , reduced to the minimes .
We 're digitalizing almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was to spend from the analogical world of the computer biology in the digital world .
Now we ask us : can we regenerate life , or create new from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest genome that can autorem into the lab .
And we tried to reduce the ulterly to create one more smaller .
We can eliminate a hundred genes of the way of the 500 that I 'm here .
But when we take a look at his map map , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
I retended , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very improbable that this can bring a living cell .
So we decided that the only way the only way to progrew this crowd crowd to mosome components to bring the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the " Poses " we can synthesize a chromosome ? "
It can be the chemical to make these big molecules that never could make these big molecules that we never have to create before ?
And in case , we can make a crop ?
A cromosome is simply a chemical material of chemical material .
The speed that we 're able to digitalize life is growing exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , procreated rather , but it 's getting getting better .
And our most recent results of it on a exponential curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process required a lot of pass , starting with a biothical review , we started the first experiments .
But we found that DNA synthesize that is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of machines of cars on DNA , the longem of 30 to 50 letter , and it 's a degenerative process : the letter segment is a longer , the segment is a longer , the herrors there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and run the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt , to go from the digital information of the genome of Phi 174 .
It 's a little bit of bacteria that kills .
We designed the fragments , we did the recorrection of errors and get a DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material , and we put it into the bacteria , bacteria have started to read this genetic code and producing viral particles .
And then viral particles were required by the cells , they 're back and they destroyed the E. coli .
I 've been talking about recently , with membres of the oil industry and they certainly compressed this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things larger .
We wanted to build the entire cromosome of the bacteria .
It 's more than 580,000 genetic code .
So we thought of building it in the size of the viruses , so that we could change the cassets cassets of a living cell living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard accurately was a mistake for every 10 miles .
We found , resequency , 30 hero .
One part of the process is to design segments that are over 50 letters that they have to have all the other segments of 50 letters to build subunits that are small small small small units working together .
Let 's try to be a only here .
You probably have read that we put it on the physical figure out .
Think of it : we have a genetic code based on four letters : A , G and TG and Ti.
Three of those letters together code about 20 minoes , and there 's a specific order to a remarkable order to each amount of letters .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frames , frames , thoughts .
What we did was a autograph to do .
Some of them were deluses from the fact that it wasn 't poetry .
We designed these segments to just just just to join them .
There are it enzy them and put them assime .
And we started to assemble parts , starting with segments from five to segments , unender by five to segments , unending segments of 24 mies letters to get to 72 thousand told them to 72 thousand miles .
So we have these segments in abundance , so we 're going to sequencing these sequencing , so we 're trying to create a very robust -- you see in a minute .
We 're trying to author the process .
So , this seems the tabellon of a basket playoff .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 thousand bottom of 100 miles , they don 't grow more directly in the E. coli .
It 's coming to the limit of the modern tools of the molecular biology .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We know one other mechanism called the homologue recombination , which in biology is using biology to repair the DNA can stand to repair the segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiation , can absorb three million rad radiation .
You can see in the super requarters like his chromosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it looks like before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms are completely seedites .
They can live under a vacuum .
They 're absolutely certainly that life exists in space , and you could find new water environments .
Actually , NASA showed that is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built these processes , just using the light-of-in-insert design segments .
The least assemble them .
This image was not taken with a electronic microscope , but with a tremendous microscope .
It 's a great molecule that we can see it with a microscope with a microscope .
These are pictures that are a time of about six seconds .
This is the publishing we 've done a little time ago .
It 's more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a definitely defined structure .
It 's a molecular weight to 300 million .
If we stop it with a 10 without spaces , you would like 142 pages , it would like 142 pages to turn this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How do we activate it ?
Of course , you do a virus is a guy game .
It 's a little more complicated when they use bacteria .
It 's more simpler when it 's eucarily , you can just extract the nucleus as to get it nucleus and put another , which is basically the clonation process .
In the bacteria , the archaea is integrated instead of inside the cell , but we recently have recently demonstrated that we can do a transplant a cell cell to another and activity .
We could be a chromosome with a microbial species .
The two are different how humans from the topics .
We have a few gene more so that we could decide what to choose for this crop .
And then the slide with the enzymes so that we killing all proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was study -- and you 're appreciate our sophisticatoes -- the new cromosome -- the new cell cell cell .
And we were we thought we couldn 't go beyond , but we 've tried anymore in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We 've discovered that a lot of a second or a third or a third suffered by a thousand new trials in a thousands of new tracks to that species .
So who thinks evolution as a only gene to evolution as a time , and it 's not understood a lot of biology .
They 're in the enzymes called restriction . " which advoctured to the DNA .
The cromosome that was in the cell of the cell is not one .
The cell phone that we 've got to cell it .
It 's expressed , and recognized the other as an material material , has masticated , and we were returned with only the cell and the new cromosome .
it blue to be blue because of the genes we 've got .
And in a short time , all the characteristics of a species have gone , and it turned into a new species , based on a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cells .
All the proteins are changed , membranes are changed , and when we read the equivesactly to what we 've been transfer to what we 've been transferred to what we 've been transfer .
Now , this could seem alchemimic genetic , but we 're altering the software DNA to change things in a fundamental enough to a sustaff .
Now , I 've already explained that here is not talking about genesis -- but progress it in the three and a half million years of evolution , and I already said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian , where they will come to create new version of this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's obvious when we think about our needs .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right for an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 ; there are four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicinal and bal-half billion people .
It will be even more hard to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion coal , more than 30 billion coal bucks , over 30 billion bets .
That means percent millions of baries a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or whatever of the process to reduce them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to keep all the whole emission of CO2 from these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
At day , thank you to scientific discoveries around the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they 're designed for the future .
The electronics is only a dozen , about a dozen of components , and think about how many different things came out .
Our limits here are related by the biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of the rapid metods of synthesization , able to create what we call combatory combatory .
We can build a big robot that can make a big robot that can make a million cromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million different genes or to try to get the processes to make eighth of it or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , because of a little team , and to create more biology that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemical or fuel , production , chemical production or fuel vaccines .
This is an instantaneous instantaneous instaneous physician that we 're working on for being able to sit and design species .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly what they 're the genetic code .
Now we 're focusing on the fuel of quarters .
You also have seen you that ethanol from the grate was a finite finite experiment .
We have a lot of second and third generation that are enough to be soon as much higher value as a high couple of value , like eighth or different types of butang .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increase without increase more than cause food and limited the cost of food and limited the availability to turn CO2 in matter , so we 're working on to design cells that can make this purpose cells that can make this purpose , and we think we can have the first carbon as much of what generation in about 18 months .
The sunlight sunlight -- but in our discovered with CO2 is a metodom -- but in our discoveries around the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2500 meters of depth of the water .
They reverse the CO2 using molecular hydrogen molecular source .
We 're trying to understand if we can waiting if we can walking the CO2 , that can be transported by tubes , convert that CO2 in the fuel , to drive this process .
So , we think we could be able to increase what we could increase what the basic question is , what life is the basic question is Nice , versus -- we have the modest -- we have the goal of the oil industrial industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where can you ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And also , we 're working on using the same methods to create instantaneous vaccines .
You 've seen this year with influence , we 're forth back to a year and a dollar in less when it 's a dollar when it 's going to find the vaccine .
I think that this can change by saying , by combining ,
Here 's how the future could start to look at changing , now , the evolution of evolution , accelerating the synthetic evolution with bacteria , archadies , and finally cellubrand .
We 're so on the best people .
Our purpose is to do enough to live long enough to try and make it . Thank you very much . Thank you very much .
I 'm going to show you , the fastest possible possible , some fundamental job , some fundamental job , a new technology that we took to Microsoft in the following one year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a place that you can interact is to local level that you can interact is to a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of digital gabytops of digital photos , and continuous speed , for a panoramic speaking , disponing the images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these are gathering data or images .
Most of the photographs , but this is a such , but this is a wild-provided scanning from the Bioeca Congress , and reaching in the 300 megapied .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that the only thing that the prestations of a system , like this is the number of pixel on your screen on your screen in any time . It 's a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , example of no data , not images .
This is the Dickens of Dickens . Every colonful , colonful is a chapter .
And to show you that it 's just about textbook and not images , we can do something like that , to make a real thing to show that it is a real representation of the textbook , not a picture .
It could be an artificial way to read a little electronic book .
I don 't have to advice .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of The Guardian .
Every large picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and beautiful experience to read the charge version of a super revision or a quote , which is a lot of a quote , which is a lot of half .
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of The Guardian .
We created a higher ads advertising -- much more higher than what you use in a normal advertising -- and we put it in a normal advertising -- and we put you in the extra .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see them here .
Or other models or other models , or even the techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
It 's hopefully to put the pop-up to the pop-up pop-up pop-up , not to be necessary .
Of course , the map applications is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if we don 't mean that we have contributes to give you a field in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , a geospatial picture of NASA .
So we 're going to go to something else .
This is actually from the Web of the web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosyntheless , which combine two different technologies .
A is Seadragon and the other is a visual visual computer very interesting that was done by Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington , with Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Seitz of Microsoft Research . "
And it 's from Seb , the Web , gestite by Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this pattern , where we can go from a picture to the other picture and have this kind of experience , and have this kind of experience .
But the space collocation is actually a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization of the computer have recorded these pictures together , so that correspond to the real place place in which the pictures -- all of these pictures are all spaces .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space .
I want to go directly to one of the Noah-Noah-- and this is from a prototype of Photosynnnthrow -- to show you what I think is really the key scorce on -- to show you what I think is the key behind this technology , technology Photosynthels . And it 's not necessarily evident to look at the environments we put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a rebuild of Notre of the Notre Dame of People 's Dame . Baast , types of Notre Dame in Flickr , and you get images of the magician , other people in the shirt of the campus , other arancies of these arancions are discovery to this model .
So they 're all picked up by Flickr , and they were all colleaged to this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this way simple .
You know , I never thought I would have thought I 'm going to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying to remember this kind of accoholding here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different types of different slies of phones to the phones in those professional phones to the SLR phones , a meaning , must together in this environment .
And if I can do it , I try to try and look for those strange .
Many of them are faces of faces , etc .
Somewhere there is a series of photographs -- here it 's a series of photographs -- here it 's a series of photographs -- here it 's a series of photographs -- and here it 's a series of photographs -- and it 's a series of photography -- and there is a series of a picture of photography -- here .
This is a Notre poster Dame recorrectly .
We can go from the poster to the vision of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the collective memory -- from the collective memory -- and the vision of vision -- and I links all those data together .
All of those pictures are linked together , greater than the sum of parts .
You have a model of the land that is emerges .
Think of this as a Stephen Lawler 's work on Earth 's work .
It 's something that grows in complexity as a lot of people to use it , and the advantages for the use .
Their picture are marched with other people .
If somebody is the idea of meet to make all these saying the name , my photograph of Notre catthedral to Notre Dimprovisely , you get to all these data , and I can use the meant to get into that space , in that metaphor , in that metaphated the pictures of everyone , using the photographing , and have a social experience of cross-moot-from social experience ,
Naturally , a consequence of all this are virtual models of every interesting interesting , on the land , collapse of every interesting , collected by satellite images and similar , but from the collective memory .
Thank you .
CA : I realized ? What 's good ? What your software is going to us to do is that a point in the next few years , all the photograph are all pictures of anyone in the entire world will be basically college together ?
BA : Yeah . What 's doing is basically discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , between the images .
And it 's doing it in the base of images .
And the thing is really interesting if you think about the wealth of semantis that many of these images that many of these images are able images that many of these images are that many images that many of these images are going to be .
As you do a research on the web , you 're digits , and the textboard , and the textbooks on the web page .
Now , what if that picture is that pictures up to all your pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of wealth that is really huge . It 's a classical classic . It 's a classical classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible .
BAA : You 're very much .
One of the major pleases when you travel and one of the etnographics research is the power to live between who has no forget the anti-forgood-on please , the past in the wind , the wind of the rainy , the piogges of the plants .
Basti think that Jaguar sciamans even beyond the Via of Lattea , or whatever the old Inuit 's still a model of meaningly , or Himalayas , the buddies are still going to remember the major of the Dharma , to remember the importance of the Dharma , and that the idea that the world we live in no exists , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choice that our styes has done , well or bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
All right . Everyone is .
We 're supposed to be returned .
We have to deal with the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprising and ballit --
We all have an art .
What hit is the particular of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that the Borig 's 's 's " Borneo , or the follows of Haiti , or the Haiti 's Borriers , or the desert Kenya , or the Curandle 's Curandmels , or a cameras in the Auren of the Sahara .
He was my journey in the desert of a month ago , or a yak hadoor a yak haiter , in the Everest , the dead mother of the world .
All of these populations teachers are teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of being moved in the world .
And if you reflect a second , it 's a concept that can give you a hope .
And along , the world 's conduct of the world creating a spiritual life , a spiritual life and cultual life that we have the planet and cultual well-being as the planet as the biological ragnature as the planet as the biological beautiful .
And you can think about this cultural ragnature as a nice nosmooth and you can define ethnosfhere , the total , dreams , dreams , ideas , inspiration , inspiration , intuitions , ideas , inspiration , inspiring , intuitions , ideas , inspiring , inspiring .
The etnosphere is the patrimony of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be as a species .
And because the biosphere was a very much consumed by the way , as well as a very , ethnosfurely .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species has been or on the horrix of the extinction , because it 's falalse -- in the most apocalycles -- in the world of biological diversity -- and not even close to the most optimistic diversity -- that of cultural diversity .
The index of all that is , of course , the language .
When you were born , there were 6,000 of the languages on this planet .
A language is not only by a vocabulary , or a series of rules , or a series of rules .
A language is the spraw of the human spirit .
It 's the middle of every culture is coming in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a back-, a spiritual chance , a spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we 're here to Monterey , at least half of the children .
They 're not more teached to children , which means that it 's not going to be in the less than wasn 't going to do .
What is more sad than the sad of being the silent , of being the last to talk a language , not having a language , that we have no way to transmit the wisdom of the children ?
This orring is the state of someone in the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks a old old old old muore and brings with it to the last syllables of a ancient language .
And I know somebody 's going to say , " Isn 't it ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we 're all the same language ? " Well , we talk to yoruba . We talk cantonese .
Let 's talk kogue .
You 're going to cover a tract thing that means you can 't talk to your language .
I 'd like to do a journey through the name --
a little journey in the etnosh to give you a little bit of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of existing existing existing different ways of existing existing .
So let 's take for example , this Barasana Barasana , in Amazon , the anaconia popular , which believes the myth of the walls of snails in the snaked snails .
It 's a popular that is that it 's a population that it 's blue to the green color from the green because the forest cear is identified in time of the forest , whose popular .
They have a strange language and a matrimonic rule , detailing , " " you have to spot a person who speak a different language .
All of this roots in the past , but the particular particularity is that in these families that are talking about six or sees that are talking about six or sees , because of mysticks , no one languages .
They 're limited to listen to listen and then start to talk .
Let 's take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waorani Waorani Eastern Ecuador , a populous populous populous that the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have been trying to a factory herror .
They did it down to the high photographed them that were in a few of adichevolved , forest that this population population had never seen bi-dimensional population had never seen bi-dimensional bi-dimensional population .
They collected the picture of the land , they turned to the research of a form or a figure and , not find nothing , they have concluded that was the diavel , and they killed the five missionarian .
But the Worani is not only killed the strange of the foreign ,
They killed in their .
54 percent of mortality was caused by the same .
We 're risalites to eight generations and found two natural cases of death and when we stayed to know , they have loved a lot of them , which was aging , and then they were killed to be that . And then they killed it . Really , and then they killed it the same .
The catters were able to recognize the animal hurine for 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early ' 80s , I was assigned a very interesting task when I was Harvard to me if I wanted to go to Harvard to Haiti to intruly intruly me to Haiti to the base of Duvalier 's Tonton Macoues , and impossed to do the zombike of the speed walking .
To give miraculous miraculous miraculous , I should understand the Vodoun culture and that Vodoo is not magic .
It 's pretty much a complex metaphysical vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianesimum , Islam , Budddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharian Africa has not had a religious light-Saharan Africa has been driving from these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of slavery in slavery .
What makes the voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , you know , you know , the spirits .
Pries can be invited by the Great Acqua , they respond to the dance of dance and replaced temporary to the soul of the view of the true is the following goes .
For this voodooists are saying , " You 're white white white to God .
We say in the temple and forget God .
And since you 're going to be , is the spirit that you guide , how can you do the bad you ?
So you 're seeing these incredible events : following voodoo in the state of trance that touching impunes , a very strong demonstration of the power of mind when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme , when it 's catalyzed .
And in all the populers that I lived the most extraordinary are the Kogi of Sierra Nevada de Sierra Nevada , the Colombia sector sector .
Except of the old civilization that once had on the planner of Colombic planning in the Colombia in the waiting , population population was on the vulcanic massive planning .
In a blood continent , this popular popular , this popular population never been conquered by the spages .
At today , they 're government by a clero , but their formation is very extraordinary .
The following people are taken by the family to the family to the family three or four , and they live secregated in a good world , and they live in a good world , and they live in the ice of the ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years to reproduce nine months to reproduce nine months that spend into the user of the mother , now are metaphor in the user of the Great Mother .
For this time , they 're acculturated to the values of their society , values that predict their predict and only their prayers to keep the cost equilibrium , or to say the balance ecological .
At term of this incredible began , they 're suddenly taken out and for the first time in life , at the age of 18 , at the age of the first of consciousness , when the sun lide , the pattern of the first bad , when the sun is the beautiful beautiful beautiful , everything they learned theory is conster all of his splanding , and says ,
" Would it ? I be like to do it .
It 's stupend . It 's to you protect it .
They 're called the bigger frath , and they say we , we 're huge , the mines , we 're the holds of the world 's destruction .
This is intuition of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about involves and the environment , we 're invoking Rousing and the old story of the noble noble wild , which is a razy concept in his simplicity or perhaps in the simplicity or perhaps to the Earth of us .
The Ingenius are not feeling , nor indebull .
There 's no space for these things in the palues of the Astststage or in the gelids of the Tibet , but because of time and I returned , created a Torkay of the Earth basis not on the concept of being known . But on a bird of beautiful neighbor , but on a bright , the concept that the Earth can only be because it 's infected by human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
It 's like a kid of Ande that grow 's a boy of Ande that the mountain is a beax that will drive his destiny human being to be a depth different depths and will have a different report of the Montana or that place or whatever the mountain or that place is a boy , and it 's a friendly , you know , you know , it 's going to be scared .
That 's the dimtaining or a mineral cave is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the report between the natural and the natural world .
I grew up in the forest of the Britannica Britannica credating that forests service to be cut .
And that 's made me a human being from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forest are the Hukuk dimora of Hukuk and the paradise of the paradise and the spirits of the paradise , spirits that live on the north of the world , spirits that are dealing in the Hamateuky .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of their sensitive discoveries . We take this plants .
I took this picture to open in the north-docted Amazon .
Mayahuge of you have heard of the ayahuge , the most powerful psycholdest .
What makes it fascinating playahuge plasks the plasks of sustainable , but his elements . It 's two elements .
From a late side , this liana legacy that contains a series of betacarboline , harmine and harm-moles , slightly .
Take the only plant , you have a blue fire that alters a little bit the consciousness , but it 's mixed with the leaf of the coffee 's family , and it 's a blue of the coffee said .
This is a tripes of tripes , very similar to the serotonin the serotonin the serotonin , methoxyltryltryltryltryltrylis .
If you ever see Yanomami , you 'll see the nose of the nass that make a different set of species , anched methoxylypamine .
Addust on the nose is a little bit like being disappeared by a piece of pinches of pink pink , and landing on an electricity . Reate not creates a destortion of the reality .
I 'm often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who took the psychedelic was psychedelic , with his discovered fungi in the 1930 in Mexico .
I 'm not going to do my tesis , you can 't get these tripsts like hallucinogens because if you 're not told anybody to be hallucinated .
It 's possible to be absuit to just if you 're just a little bit of other chemicals that denaturate MAO .
Now , it 's the beautiful : the beta-carboline , which is in this liana of MAO , the same kind of need to be able to tripstage . The question of the tripstage . The question is , in a 80,000 species of plants , like these populations are not , but if you combined two deaths don 't similar , but if you combined this way , create a biochemical version that 's summmer to the sound ?
We use the great euphymism of proof and error , that can be revealed infrutes .
But if we ask the Indians , they will say , " The plants are talking about it . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuash , which are nership in the forest , and that our eyes would be in the forest species .
If we ask them as they are to stage their tonomics will say , " I thought of plants , you know , you know , the rest of plants , you don 't know . I said , " No . "
The solution is : they take the 17 varieties in a night of ball and each night to a little different .
With this is not sleeping us to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that contact statement .
Now , [ the ] ] the problem is that even the ones of us who have heart the populations are pittoric populations are pittoresome , but somehow reduced to our real world , and pass beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , it will not be reminded for the wars or its innovations , but rather as the trouble or innovations , but rather as the way we stopped and habulated actively or accepted destruction of diversity diversity of diversity diversity and cultural diversity of the planet . Now , the problem isn 't the change .
All cultures through the secles have been involved in a dance for new life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux didn 't have to be Sioux when they put it archies and holds as well as Americans have been powered and free as Americans have been powerful when they put from horse and calved .
It 's not the change or technology that they thnosfetime . It 's the power .
The fly of domination .
And if you look at the world , you 'll find out that these are not cultures that these are not cultures are not in disappeared to disappear .
They 're living creatures and dynamics and dynamics out of identifable forces that go beyond their adaptation .
Which is it tracks in the patria of the Penan .
a populum noun-in-souest , in the Souast , a popular population who has lived free to the forest and prostitution on the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to the service re-rive reef that seems can be taken midle of the win-half Borneo towards Merian , where the naveled Merian , where the naveling horries ,
ready to refer the standing of the forest dream with the forest dream .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease came with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on the Tibet mountains of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physical extinction of a popular , is convicted to universal level , but the ethnocide , the destruction of the lifestyle of life , not only is condanned , but it 's not condanned , but it 's a strategy development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet is suffering from the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in China in the Western China through Tibet , coming to Lhasa a young man who 's behind a young hasa young hasa young hasa hasa young hasa lot of .
6,000 sacres in reduced and holding .
1.2 million people killed by the military military during the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical to Panchen Lama .
That means that it was killed to the time of Chinese invasion .
His uncle furniture with Sua Santity in the diaspora that led the popular in Nepal .
His mother been impresoned and his colputs was recognize .
It was taken to hide in the age of two to hire age age at the age of two under his guns because he couldn 't live without him to live without him .
And the sister , that has done the same , was put in reeducation .
One day he walked up a day , a couple of Mao and , for this transgression , has been mitted to the work forced for seven years .
The Tibet can be insuit can be insuit , but the rein the rein the population of the population is holding .
At the end , all of it is a choice .
We want to live in the world monotony or we want to account the world of the diversity ?
The great anthropologa Margaret Mead , before he die said her biggest fear was that , in our way to go to this love of the world , not only we see the entire gamm of human imagination , we 're going to see the whole gamm of human imagination , but one day we 're going to sleeping other possibilities .
And it 's humiliating our species is for 60,000 years .
The Neolitical Rivolution , who gave us the agriculture , which did us have done us to the seed cult of the seed cult , and they 're going to be able to the sler of the sler , creating the gerarchy of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has 300 years .
That is qualities that we have the answers that we have the answers that we 're going to all the answers that we have to deal in millennia to come .
When these miric miric miric miric miric miric mixes .
And it 's in these answers that we all have to be what we 're going to be what we 're : a conscious species , that we 're aware , that we 're all the people and all the gardens can truly .
I took this picture on the northern extremity of Baffin , when I went to the Baffin the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , I told the wonderful story of her grandfather .
The government canadly was not always gentle with the Inuit and in the 1950s to stage our supply , we require them in colonies .
The grandfather to the granding us .
And the family , I was afraid all of his life , and all of his attacks , and all his attacks .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't teach the cold , exploit .
The sled-sled-in origin were balloaded of cartoon .
The non-intimed at night , the arctic night or the library that they were suffered .
It 's gattacked out , it 's hot the pantalone , and defecated in your hand defecated in your hand . When the ball of the bama .
He spained on the door of this hit , and when they became solid , and when they became solid , she killed a dog .
He scacen , he created a bridle , with the house cash of the house , and it 's created a sledge , and it 's disappeared on the banknice , the cell phild of the cell ,
We want to talk about cavarsely with nothing ? [ Resilience ] . And this is , in different ways , [ Apahi ] is the symbl of the resilience of the Inuit and all the people in the world .
In the 1999 , the government canader redded the Inuit re-control of a larger territory area of a larger territory area of California and Texas .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's an independent term . Controlly all the minerary resources .
One splendid example of a nation-state can remember with his popular .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious at least at least at the time of us was in these wasn 't affect .
For somebody is home .
They represent sections of human imagination that are remarkable to get the high of the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , becomes part of our children , becomes part of the hope of the hope of the hope of the hope .
Finally , we have National Geographic we are convinced that politicians will never get nothing to get to nothing .
We believe that polemies --
[ Applausi ] hasn 't persuits , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe the best institution to tell the world . Each month of our website . Each month 35 million lives .
156 countries transmit our television canal .
Our revision are literally laid by millions of people .
Our job is to travel in the etnossphere to bring our audience in places of beautiful cultural , and hopefultold the world of the anthropology : the world 's going to be able to be in the central diversity : the world 's going to be in the midle of life , and we have to find a multicultural free lifestyle in a world and multicultural world
where the wisdom of all the popular wisdom .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope I 'm going to reach some of the links that you 've heard and I 'm going to try and get to evidence some of the nothing that I 'm going to talk about it .
I want to start with what I call " " " " " " " " " " " " " " "
The official dogma is official to what ?
The official dogma dogma 's official societies . The dogma sufficial dogma is , " If we want to massive to male the well-being of our citizens . "
The reason is , from a side , in the fact that freedom is in itself a value , is precious , useful , essential , useful , essential for human beings .
And the other is that if we 're free , each of us can act for all of us can do everything that massive our well-being , no one that decided to our well-being , no one that decided to our name .
The way to massive freedom is massive to chool the choice .
More choice , the people are free , and more is their liberation , more , the greater is their well-being .
This , I think , it 's so deeply radical in society that nobody would have to put it in doubt .
And it 's also deeply radical in our lives .
I 'm going to show you a few examples of what progress has been possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly great .
I 'm just going to be a simple note on the condition .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditiments , no content 10 varieties of oil , and 12 holive oil and 12 acks huge , and 12 huge numbers that nobody of the 12 of constantly constantly in the circumstmstance that nobody of the 175 , already is to your degree .
Here 's what supermarket .
Then go to the electronics stereo to buy a stereo : CD , letter , letter , radio , radio , piaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaan : CD , letter , radio , the CD , radio , the CD , radio , the CD , pink , the CD , letter , pair , pink ,
And in this single electronics negoties , there 's a great clear components .
We can do six million and a half of different combining the components that there are only one negoties in one .
You have to admit that there 's a lot of choose .
Others : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the phone services , you could get all the phone services that were provided by mom Bell .
He was doing the phone , they didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , by the way , was that the telephone never break .
These time are gone .
Now we have a variety of telephones , especially between cellular phones .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cut of the nose , and the baby to the Busme .
If you don 't have seen it in the negotie under home , you 're going to get .
And what is the end is that people enter in the negozes in and ago . And you know , you know , what is the answer ? The answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do things too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the purchases , you versus the same choice explosion of choice .
Auseful healthcare : it doesn 't happen in the United States that you go from doctor and doctor , you have to say what to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , " Okay , we could do A , or B , " Those " Buy , " Be , " Big these benefits and these risks . What do you do ? "
Does you say , " Dr. " What should I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , and B , B has these benefits and these benefits . "
" What do you do ? "
And you rebad , " Dr. " Would you be me , what would do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not her . "
The result of the result of the malth " autonomy , " expression that makes it seem to look good .
But it 's not that a move the weight and responsibility to make decisions from someone knows the doctor , to someone else knows -- and almost certainly maled -- and so it 's almost certainly maled -- so it 's not in the ideal condition to make the patient decisions of patient decisions to make the patient decisions that is not that a lot of the patient .
There 's a huge marketing of drugs products , direct people like me and you , that if you think it doesn 't have any sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do they do it ?
The answer is that they want to do it by the next morning we call the doctor for us to change it .
Something that is fundamental as our identity is a question of choice , as we see in this vision , " We don 't want to force children . We don 't want to give children to the right sex . " We don 't want to be an identity : we need to invent .
And we can reinventing how many times we have .
That means that every morning , at the morning , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I repective family and marriage , a time time perspective , almost for the common , contated almost for anyone , was that was that we moved to the most possible possible possible .
The only real choose was with who , not when , and not when you , and not what to do after .
And it 's really to play .
I teach very intelligent students , and I do 20 percent , and I do do 20 percent of work than a time .
And it 's not because they 're less brilligent , not because they 're less diligent .
but why are they impensit , you know , I 'm going to ask , " Would I be mark or not ? I 'm going to do it now ? "
" I should be marrier ? I have to think about the kids or the career ? "
They 're a logative interrogative .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this implay , you don 't completely get the tasks of my extent to my own extending .
And they really have to do it . They 're very important .
Now , the job : we 're lucky , like Carl underlath , because it allows us to work every day , every day , every day , from the Hotel Randolp-oll , and that was the Hotel Randolphy-olds .
Turker , there 's a corner , and I 'm not going to say , where the WiFi works .
I don 't say , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about the job ? It 's going to keep , continually in every moment , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our child playing , with the cell phone in a tax , the Blackberry in the other , and the notetetextbooks .
And even though they are all spent , every minute that we see our child , we 're also wondering , we also ask , " I should say this called ? "
" I have to say to this email ? I have to hables this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , all this makes the experience of your child-to-driven child 's not been in other conditions .
So , from any part of the look at , and large materials , large materials and the lifestyle , life is a question of choice .
Once the world was this : Oband , there were some possibilities , but it wasn 't a question of choice .
The world today is it a good thing , is , " Is it ? "
The answer is , it 's Shand .
So , the positions of the negative ones . So I 'm going to talk about the negative ones .
All of this choice is two negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxally , is that produces instead of paralysis that produces instead of liberation .
With so many options that choose to choose , it becomes very hard to do it .
I offer a meaning example : a conduct study conduct on the plans of volunteer pensive plans .
A colleague has had access to the data of Vank data , the giant society , by about a million clients in 2,000 different companies of couple of different customers in 2000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adesion , two percent .
With 50 funds , there 's 10 percent of adeside , there 's only 10 percent of adesion . Why ?
Because with 50 funds that choose , is maledly hard to decide , and choose is hard to decide , and choose is remainly hard to the question .
And then , I 'm still going to ask , questions , questions , and of course , questions , and of course , I don 't get .
You know that doesn 't mean only that these workers are going to be a hatch of hatch for canoes because they 're not going to have enough money , it 's so hostics that they lose the funds of complementary complementary complementary the funds of the work .
Don 't participating , they 're lost until five dollars to the work dator , which would be well to real disposite them .
So the paralysis a consequence of the tropps .
And I think it makes the world so .
" And finally , " for eternity : ketchup , hard or maionese ? "
You just want to take the right decision , if it 's the right , is for ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the bottom , and you don 't want to choose the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that if we could avoid the paralysis , and make a choice , at the end of how we would have been with less options from the result of how we would have been with less options between which I choose .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions that choose , if you buy a lot of them , and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you would have a different choice that would be better . And what happens is better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us industries , and the report the squeen , and the recognize the slightly to the decision ,
even when it was a good decision .
More choice are , the more easy is easy to any detailing than any detailing is the choice of choice .
And there is what economists call constery .
Dan Gilbert asked very well as a value that we do things that we do to things that we do .
In the rest , when there are many options of the options of the alternal features of alternative , and be less switches and less switch that option is choose .
Here 's an example . I school with all the people who are not New York .
But it 's what you probably think .
There 's this couple to the Hamptons .
A place of luses .
Spidaunting . Otday . It 's all about them .
Nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , maledition , it 's Augost . "
" All my neighbors at Manhattan is . "
" I could talk to right in front of home . "
And it 's two weeks , and it 's going to be losing -- every day -- the chance of parking -- the chance of park to .
The constered opportunity is the satisfation for what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And the more are the options that we have to look at , the more acacacacactive characteristics are going to return out as expensive opportunities .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things .
It talks about living the moment , and maybe of living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you 're choose , you 're squeens , you don 't do the other .
The things that we don 't choose are so many active attractive that can make less active active what we do .
Tirt point : it 's growing expectations .
I tried it on my skin beating a new couple of jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were only one like , buy them and the besty , they were discovered , only after they were purched , only after they took them a lives and washed a lot of times , they started to go well .
So I went to buy a couple again when the old ones were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cuts . "
And he said , " He wants to me , " He wants to fit , hit , relaxed , relaxed ? "
He wants to the certainly or with the bottons ? " Stonewashed , " or " action " ? "
" Do you want to strapped ? "
" Soth them takes large , a bl ? Bule bla -- " Continured to elencare .
I was saying , and after a while I was able to say , " I want the guy -- that was the only kind of , " I want to have no idea what , so for a time , I tried to all the jeans , and then I went out of the jeans , and then I walked out of the jeans that ever had .
It was the massive . I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was worse that I was that with all the whole choice , the myself is very high jeans , jeans had to be perfect .
I was expectations . I didn 't expected anything excited when there was only a guy , but when there was only a guy , but when it was 100 different , they were there 100 different , high , at least a guy .
What I had was buy , but not perfect .
After I had compared that choose with what I was trying to do in comparison the expectations .
The addition of options in life does not make people that increases that are the expectations that these have respond to options to the options of options .
And this will make less sleeping , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing in the world of marketing .
Because if they know , you won 't know what I 'm talking about .
It looks more like this .
" He was better when they were worse , " The reason why you were better when she was worse , she was worse when she was worse , she was worse to meet surprised .
And the world we live in the world that we live -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the expectancy -- the massive of perfeet , is that the height of the expectations of expectations .
You never surprised because your expectations , because your expectations , the myself is ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse , " Yes , you want to do it . "
I mean -- little autobiography -- that I 'm really sposed and my wife is really stupid .
I couldn 't have to do better , I didn 't have to do it .
But it 's not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of the compring a couple of jeans is that when you 're only that jeans is that when you 're not satives , and ask you , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " "
The world is responsible . What can I do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a jeans , and you buy a lot of the jeans , it 's the responsible , it 's as well as well as well as a close to the responsible to you .
You would be done better .
With hundreds of available varieties , there are no high .
So when people are making decisions , even if the result is the result is , they feel involved and give the holds to them .
In the last years , the depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a meaning factor -- not the only , but important -- this is honate -- but important -- of this depression is really that people have experiences of the standards are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the color is they 're .
So the final result is that we 're better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely false . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than haven 't at all of it , but it doesn 't have any tremendous choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been super-hand-up piece of the level where the choice are improve our life .
Now , from political view -- I 've almost finished -- from political view , the political nocce .
What allows all this choice in industrial societies is the material rich material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem isn 't they have too much chosen .
The problem is that they have too poor too .
So the face of the modern I 'm talking about is a melighborhood of modern , remember ,
And what it does to have to be , and this is this : Steve Levitt talked about yesterday about how the expensive constoes and discovers for baby are unuuuuuuseful .
I mean , these choose , complicated and dispends , it 's not just inuseful .
I 'm going to say of the eteries .
They 're worse .
If a little bit of what in our societies allows choice was reversed in those where people have too population , it would be not only their lives to improve , but our life .
This is what economists call a paretian improvement .
A redent refined refined well -- not only to the poor -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice , excess that 's going back .
For conclude , you can become everything you want ,
You , you know , people are you think , " What makes that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make anything in a glass . "
" A castrated imagination , a limited view of the world -- "
and that 's what I interpreted , at the beginning .
But then , I realized , instead , I realized that the long-gathering fish .
Because the reality of fact is that if you 're eating the boat the boat , so that it 's possible , " You don 't get freedom . " You get the paralysis . "
If you break the bocket so that all can be decrease .
Let 's go to the paralysis , and you 'll reduce the well-being .
Everyone needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too , maybe even for fish , and it 's certainly for us .
But the absh of some symbols is a recipe for infection and , for the rovement .
Thank you for heart .
