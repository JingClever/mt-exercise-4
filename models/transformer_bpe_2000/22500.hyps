I showed this year I showed these positive demonstrate slide to show that the artical glacial , which for almost three million years of the United States , it 's reply 40 percent .
However this subjected the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice of the ice ,
The arct glacial calots is , in a sense , the clear of the global climate system .
You can see it 's inverinter and reverse it .
The next slide is going to be a fast-fasted carlated on the last 25 years .
The gaaces have been signed in red .
And as you see , they 're going to the blue blue .
That 's the ice in inverinter , which you reverse .
You can see that the ice cosidgn , of five years , or more , is like the blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which here was the body .
In 25 years , it 's spent by so .
This is a problem because the scale of the entire scale of the land around the ocean arctic where there are enormous amount of coal congeled that , scientists , they 're transformed in the microbes .
It turns out to the totality of the atmosphered global warming , that amount of global ward-doubling , that amount of the way , on 't return .
In some deep , in some deep in Alaskka , the metane is already rebullening from water .
The professorous Katey Walter of the University of Alaska has been recently reverse a lake , the scored last invernal .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Lake 's good . The question is if we 're going to be .
A reason is that this third exchange surrewarming Greenland from the northermal .
This is a river reme reme .
He never had to reach it had never reached it .
This is the river Kangerlusaq , in the west of the Greenland of the Greenland .
If you want to know how the level of the mate of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice , here is where the sea .
These corrings are increasing rapidly .
On the other side of the planet : Antartttargake of the planet .
The month , the month have directly directly the gaian is in negative , and that the Antarctared , and that the Antarcttared , that poor some islands , is particularly fastern .
It 's six feet of the agland , like Greenland , like Greenland .
On the Himalayas , the biggest block of ice , they see new laghes , which few years ago were glacier .
F40 percent of the world population will recognized water from the population .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the poable of the poable water of this city .
And the brought is increased .
But when you decrease , the same happens to the same access to the water water .
In California , the snow on the Nevada is diminuit , 40 percent .
The backkkkkay , they 're in cribes .
People like you 've read , I 'm floor .
The growth of the world door to a remarkable increasing the incends .
The disasters are increasing environmental disaster , and without precedental precedental .
Four times more numerous numerous times in the last 30 years , which is 75 .
This is a lot of the insustainable .
If you look at it in the stories , if they can see the consequences .
In the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons in the ocean every day .
Look attentily the area of the Eastern Pacific , from the Americas , and on both the west , and both the parts of the Indian continent , where there is a radical imor of the ocean .
The major because of the global warming , together to the deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuels .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And he was going to build a lot of other other carbon .
But we 're seeing a changer of direction .
These are the projects annative projects in the last few years and some projects of versus .
And so , there 's a politics in our country .
The coal industries of the oil and oil have 250 million dollars in the last year to promote coal , which is a bone , which is a bone .
And this image , I remember something --
I 'm Natale , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion lions of carbon diocoal .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second largest flow of the big flow of America .
It happened around Natal .
The published by one of the coal industries of one was this one .
Video : See the carbon is a pair , is a purpose and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's going to grow our economy .
Frosty the carbon is and more and more and more .
It 's a good price , and the workers and working hold the stypendent stunning .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest ministrator on the mountains is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'm going to go -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Protection of Clima has launches .
This is a part of them , one part .
Video : Actor : All COLergy see the climate change as a serious threat to our business .
So , our priorities is investing a great amount of money in a public force to make public and confused to make public and confused to the truth .
Actually , coal is not sporco .
We think it 's a good way -- it 's also a good profuse .
So , not preocupateves of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Carbone , you heard a lot of it -- you heard a lot of it .
So , we have a turn in a structure on the side of the pattern , it 's about the coal ,
Straordinary ! The car is a little bit noious , but this is the sound of the technology of coal clean ,
The coal consumption is between the major cruster , but the remarkable technology , but the remarkable to see it .
You 're a look at : this is the hood-technology of clean technology .
Al Gore : Indeed , the open-positive alternative connett question and at the economic security and the national security .
Video : Let 's see America is in crime ; the economy , the national security , the national crisis .
The flows that the links : our dependence on fossil fuel , like the coal and oil imported oil .
Now , there 's a new , car solution for it .
Repower America : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to reput America to work , make us more safe , and help us stop global warming .
Finally , a solve that you can solve our problems .
Repower America . You 're more than .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's going to re-fun energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to bring the dependence on the dependence that killed our planet .
What 's the future is here . For , only one , a new energy , a new energy ,
What you know two : Noves investment for people who are bad for people in the work of work .
Comment : Repower . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A vast African proverbio says , " If you want to go fast , you go down from the money .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away away , fast .
Thank you very much .
The year at TED phecame an introduction on the LHC .
And I promise to traveling you about how the car it works .
So here I 'm . And for those that the other time there were no , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever -- 27 miles of circumference .
His to remember the conditions that were less than a billion of a second of a second of the universe -- until in the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All that 's just environment .
This is the car in Ginevra .
I 'm pictures these mini-Bang Bang in the relationship .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- it 's a 22 feet , and a 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS building so you can see the proportions .
Ten September year we have accesum cent the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because it 's immense festegation in control .
It 's a picture of the first phasy of particles that had done all the turn of the LHC , entertaining in collision , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles in the releasy .
In other words , when we see that image 10 of the ten 10 of the September , we understand the car car , which is a great victory .
I don 't know if it was this to do exultent us , when somebody went on Google and saw that the beginning was this .
That means we have had a cultural impact beyond that scientific .
About a week , there was a problem with the car , had to the car , you 've had to these dorders here -- these hored drugs .
These files are 13,000 amps when the car machine is going to the power of power .
Now , the technicians between you 're going to look at the flows and say , " It 's not true . It 's too much . "
And they can do that because when they 're very cold things are very cool slows .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a temperature inferior to the stars , these floor of the stars , these floor to the run that corrate .
In one of the guntures of the most novemile magnetals in LHC , there was a further defect .
So , the flows up slightly , and the 13,000 amps of the electricity of an electricity .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnetets more than 20 tons , and that have been moved about 30 centimeters .
They 're giving about 50 magnetets .
We had to take them , what we have done .
We repristined and encouraged .
Now they 're now returning all their place .
By the end of the LHC will be again .
We 're going to accening , and we 're going to do this data to juddging , and we 're all our adventure to discover what the universe is the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain quickly , these accidents reaccess the dibate the value of science and engineering in frontier . It 's easy to confocused . It 's easy to conft .
I think the fact that it 's so hard , the fact that it 's so hard to go beyond the value of things like LHC .
I 'd like to end with the words of a Inglese scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , imagine , in defense , in defense of his puplle , his puplens was Michael Faray , said , " Nient is so much dangerous for the human realize that the ideas of science are definites , which is not a very very very , that we 're not in our world-new words , and that we 're not in trifice , and that our words to be completely , and words . "
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to think about when you , children , you 're going to play with the morning .
As you understand how to reach them and sought them , and move them , and move them , learned to think , and move them , and learned in fact , and you 're in fact , and they 're not going to spactive relations .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand the world around us .
So , from the information information is a useful of our interaction with objects , with my consult Patt , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking , I started asking , " And if we use a computer , instead of the mouse as we 're a computer , we can true , just a computer , we could deal with a desktop of the digal mouse , we could truly a little bit of the information with both of the mouse ,
and we sistemarrate our fall ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable is a computer interactive computer like a bird baby .
In a few words , a Siftable is a computer interactive computer like a bird baby .
You can move them with hand , they can see the movement between them , they can hear their movement and have a radio and a radio radio .
But most of course , I 'm physicists , like the morning , you can just move them .
Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they get more physicists , conscious , of the other movement , and as they become more physicists , conscious , of the other , of the other , like we move , we can explore new and different styles of interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurned to show the video : if you including it in a direction , the video role that will including it back .
These interactive reports are conscious of other .
If you 're traveling them , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they 're circummit , they can be able to act a little bit .
If they 're circummit , they can be able to act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power of the interaction of data , to put the data , for example , a color like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurated as a secks of vernice and I can use them to the color in the central color in the central , where they mix .
and I can use them to put them in the central color in the central , where they mix .
If we 're too much , we can put a little bit about it .
It 's also beautiful possibilities of learning , like languages , the mathematics and logic of logic and logic of things where people can try and see the results of the immediately .
Now , I 'm going to --
This is a Fibonacequations that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that 's half of the words in Scarabean and Boggle .
Pratically , at every turn to a letter in an case on every Siftable , at every turn , you get a letter in any Siftable , and you 're trying to understand what he control him on a direct .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you have a new set of lectable and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the kids came to the Media Lab , I did this , and I did this , and I did a video .
They 're very much .
And one of the things that kind of application is that you don 't have to give people many education .
You just say , " By of words , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's other people who try it .
This is our own own younger tester , there on the right there .
It was actually just taken them .
They were only huns , for him .
Now , this is a interactive application of a interactive charge .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of the languages .
It can insert new characters in the scene , just by by by the scene , they 're just saying the associated .
It can insert new characters in the scene , just by by by the scene , they 're just saying the associated .
So , it 's doing it .
Video : The sun is source .
David Merrill : Now he brought a treat the scene .
Video : The arancient treator .
Bel work . Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah .
So I school at Siftable and put up near-to-to-to-to-to-crazy ,
Video : Bau !
and inventing their story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It 's a story with the end , and he can decide him how he did it .
DM : It 's a story with the end , and he can decide him how he did it .
Video : Voly , guns .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , realized of the instrument , to walk and execececectrouble .
It 's a tool , realized of recently , to walk and make music .
Siftable here are act from super-like sound , based , based and bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose to choose .
You can also be insert these sounds in a sequence to you in a sequence .
And it just to move it to the touch a " and a sequence . "
These are actually that you can control from the vive , like the reverbs and the filter .
The attacks to a particular sound , and then including it .
And then there are the general effects as time and fly , that you applicate the whole sequence .
We look at how it works .
DM : We 're going to start to put a base in two Siftable , we 're going to put it into a series , we 're going to a series , we add other base .
Now I put a low line of the bottom .
Video : Now I add some percussions --
DM : And now I 'll put the philtrum of bacteria , so I can control the effect from the vive .
DM : DM : DM : I can fast the whole sequence by one side or the other .
DM : And now I 'm going to add the filter to the flower to give more expression .
DM : DM : I can recombine the sequence .
So I didn 't have to plan it first , but I can improvisate it , realize it longer or more short .
And now , finally , I can fump the whole sequence inclinding to the left Siftable . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new interface mate human interface and more more more more than our brain and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this lost , and even some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmit is that we 're coming this new generation of objects designed to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
It 's a writer .
I 'm writing books is my profession , of course .
It 's also the love and the fascine of my life .
And I wouldn 't change .
But , he said this , something particular happened in my life and my career , which brought me to remember the whole report , with this job .
The particular thing is that I have recently wrote this book , this biography called Manogy , Prega , Ama , " which , which , diversity , for some reason , with some reason , and it became a big sensationship , in the world , and became a big , a sensatic , became a whole thing .
And the result is that everywhere go now , people treat me as if I was condamn .
It 's true -- condamn , condamn .
They 're now now worried and say , " Don 't you fear to be able to do better ?
You don 't have to be writing all life without power to be able to create a book that can important somebody to create a book that can important someone ? "
what can it 's important to someone ? "
It 's reverse , you know .
But it could go worse , at the time , I remember than 20 years ago , when I started to say , I was a adolescent adolescent -- I wanted to be a writh .
I 'd go to the same reaction as the fear .
And people said , " Don 't told me , " Don 't get successful ?
Don you 't have the use of the refurniture killed you ?
Don you won 't have any life without any life without that nothing is ever come out and die on a cumull of drawings with the boouth of driving with the boouth of fallic fallic .
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yeah , I 've been fear of all those things .
I always had a fear of it .
And I also fear a lot of other things that people could not be able to introuble .
As the other things split and other things .
But what I thought , and I was going to write what I thought , and I was going to be why ?
It 's rational ?
It 's logic that everyone should be spected by a job that you can do .
But what 's there is so particular in the creative impress to make us nervous about the health of the health of the way that other career do not ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember one in the only 40 years of activity in which he asked if he was fear to be engineer ?
It was never -- that block of the engineer John , how did it ?
Don 't work that , you know ?
Onestly , the engineers like chemical engineers , in the chemidddriven reputation of being high hand-pressions .
We have enough this reputation , we have enough this reputation , and not only creative writers , we have this reputation of being hustable to be enormous instable .
And it 's not remarkable to look at the sad of the dead of the minds of the creative minds that , only in the venture century , they died young and often for them .
And also the ones that are not suicides , they 're really disfaced by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , " Or my book 's book has killed a little more " . " One of my own own life . A remarkable to work of his life .
But we don 't bad cipy the way we heard these things , because we 've heard these things that we 've been completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are some way , and the art , that the art , at the end , it will be able to the ancient .
And the question I want to bring all here is : You 're saying with this idea ?
It 's good that , because it 's also looking at a hundred direction , it 's not good for anything that suppose .
I think it 's hate .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encourage our big creative minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start fire out the way to the heart of the suppose suppose circumstances where I 'm in my career .
That 's really -- you know , I 'm a pretty younger , I 'm pretty young , I 've got about 40 years .
I still have about four decades decades in me .
And it 's very likely to be able to judged by the world as the work that 's work was going to be jobs in my last book .
I 'm going to slavery , because we 're all more or less friends here -- it 's likely to my west succeed to my wild .
Oh , Gesus , who thought .
You know this is the gender of thinking that brings a person to start to the nine of the person to start ballows in the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep to keep this work that we love .
So , the question is , how do you do that ?
And so it looks , after many reflection , that the way to work to keep out of the way to continue to write is to create a psychological costruct , OK ?
I have to have a way to find a distance of security between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural reaction on which is going to be able to . And as I was trying to all the time , looking through the year , looking through time , looking through the time , trying to find other society to see if they could have the best ideas and more healthy .
about how to help people believe the creative inherent inherent people 's emotions .
And that research has brought me to the antics Great Rome .
Sedriving me because it gets back in circle and then back .
In the antics Great and antics Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity was giving humans , OK ?
It was thinking that creativity was this spirit is this spirit , and that was being being humans to be a few source and unknown , for reasons and unknown .
The greenhouse glass , the spiritual demon the creativity . "
Sococrate , wonderful , he believed to have a demon the wisdom from the wisdom .
Romanes were the same idea , but they call that sort of spirit with a genius .
That 's great , because the Romaniers didn 't really think that a genius is somebody who 's a particularly smart .
They have to be this genius was this kind of divine that was lived in the walls of the study of a study artist , a little bit like the Dobby , and that came out of the work of the job of the artist , and that came out of the work of the artist and modeling the outcome of that work .
It 's a -- here is the distance of which I talk about -- that is the psychologist you protect you from the results of your work .
And everybody knew that was that it worked , right ?
So the antiwho were protected by certain things , like the way , you know , not ?
If your work was exceptional work was not to take all the deserve , all of the deserve , all of that they were helped by this genius .
If your fallies , it wasn 't all your game , right ?
They all knew that was your genius to be a inable .
And so people han conceived creativity in the West for a long time .
Then Renascivance came and everything , and nacked this big idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe , and the misters and mists and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and more and writed space to write space creatures that they writed by divinity .
This was the rational of humanity and the people started to think that creativity was completely by the humanity , completely from the hydivide .
And for the first time in history , I begin to refer this or that artist as a rather like a person in a kind of a person .
And I have to say , I think it was a big error .
I think that allow someone , a simple person to believe that you can be like a recipent like the source , the essence and the source of all the divines , creative , inosconcible , and a responsibility of the humans .
It 's like to somebody to inguiate the sun .
Deform and distores completely the ego and creates all of these inextremely expectations on the performance .
And I think was this pressure to the artists in the past 500 years .
And if this is true , and I think that is , the question is , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between human and creative .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't sell 500 years of rational thinking in a talk of a 18 minutes .
And probably there is people between the audience that would sollevered to scientific scientific , that you do do people , you do that following people in their own projects .
You probably not convinced to you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to bring is -- why not ?
Why is not thinking that way ?
Because it 's more sense of anything that ever ever heard to explain the exaspertise of the creative process of the creative process .
A process that , as anybody who ever ever ever taken to do something -- so , basically , all here -- you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , it 's not rationally .
And , in fact , it can sometimes it looked completely paranormal .
I did this meeting in the extraordinary poet Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but it 's been a poetesh for all life and told me that was a poetetesh for the Virginia , working out in the fields , and it was in the field , when a poem was in the poem .
He said that he was like a fragorous track of air .
And that was rotate to her from the landscape .
He was heard to come , because he was so so so that he was doing it .
He knew to have a only thing to do at that point and it was , he words like a major . "
And so it goes back to home and come from this poem , and it wouldn 't have to get a piece of paper and a fairly , and a pretty quickly , as the traphion , and he won the page .
Sometimes couldn 't be fast , so that you would be fast , and it would be able to go into home and poem her rotated and she would keep it through and she would keep it through the landscape , and he would keep through the landscape , and he said , " another poet . "
Then there were the time -- this piece of the way , I never forget -- there were moments where the was almost losed , OK ?
So , he was running back home and he was trying to the card and poem the poem through , and he was a hyourself in the way , and then he said , that was like , and then he said , that was like you slow with the other hand the hand the willing .
He was offered the poem from and reput it in his body and reput it in his body , and transplay on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page , the last word , the last word at the first word .
So when I felt it -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly equal to my creative process .
It 's not all my creative process -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a music , and my way to work is ; wake up to wake up at the same time every day and I 'll go and go on and go and go on and go on and go on .
But even I , in my head , I 've striked against that thing , sometimes .
And I imagine that many of you the han fact .
You know , even if the work and ideas were given me from a certain source you could not honestly until you can 't honestly .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relationship to it out to lose us , but rather , rather , that 's pretty much , that do you do do you do that ?
And as it , as the best example of the best example of the contemporary example that I have been a Tom Waits , which I interviewed a different years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life has been the incarnation of the artist 's been the incarnation of the artist , trying to control , to manufacing these species of creative inhyzed inhyzed .
But then I 'm going to go , and he was driving on a day as she was driving on a Los Angeles , he changed everything for him .
He was going to fast and all of a sent this little balloon this little balloon , which arrive in his head , and the willing , and it 's tracking , and you want , you know , it 's wonderful , and it doesn 't know how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a match , not a record .
So he starts to hear this kind of old anxial growth , and I 'm going to lose it , and I 'll slow out of this song , and I 'll see this song ,
I 'm not enough and I can 't do good enough . "
And instead of go to the panic , he stopped .
I 'm going to do the whole process , and he did something completely new .
He just look at the sky and he said , " Scuses , not see that I 'm driving ? "
" Do you know , you know , a song now ?
If you really want to exists , you go back to a more opporting when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you 're going to do something today .
You 're going to disturba Cohen . "
And her process of working changed after this .
It was not work , the work was still shape like .
But the process , and the fish that was returned out of the process , the genius , the genius that was caused to him and sliberated it back to where it was , and he was doing that it wasn 't the whole thing that was to be interized and turned .
but it gets this peculiar , beautiful , bizarre collaboration a conversation between Tom and this thing that strange and such an exernal thing .
So how I was going to hear that story , and I was working a little bit of the way I was working on and already saved me .
This idea , I was saved when I was writing " Manogy , Prega , Ama , " and cadds in one of those cave disperation where we 're working on something and we can 't start to think that 's going to be a disaster , which is going to be a disaster , which is the book is going to be a book , which is the worst of the worst , and we can 't be a book ,
Not just bad , just the worst written .
And I started thinking about gectate this project .
But then I remember Tom that I talked about air and I try to .
So I got my face on the end of the drive and I realized my hundred a vacuum of the room .
And I said , " Shell , what we 're going to be brilliant , if we know that if this book is not be a bright , it 's not not be interactly my , not ?
Because as I 'm paying all I 'm putting everything I have , I don 't have more than this .
So if you want it to be better , you have to preserve you and make your part .
Okay . But if you do not do it , you know what , I don 't do .
I 'm going to writing the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to do it that was recorded that I 'm presented to me to do my part . " Because , it 's so , OK -- it 's so , OK -- secoluster in the North of Africa people were sitting for damage of the middanze of the midddanze and music that they were going to go on the hours and hours to the ala .
And they were always magnific , because the ballerini ballerins professionals and were great .
But every time , something happened , and something happened , and one of these artists became actually transendent .
And I know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've seen it , at a point , a performance that .
It was like the time , and the ballery , and the ballery walked through a kind of a land-up , and not doing anything else , but it was all sorts of it , but everything was moved .
And at suddenly not appeared as a human .
But it 's accentiate in the fuef in the fuocal fire of the divinity .
And when this was going on , the time , people knew what was , they call him her her name .
They were trying to switch , and they began to cantar , Allah , Allah , God , God , " God . "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note storytical -- when More invading the South , preserved this abits , and I was this abits and pronounds in the centuries from " Allah , Allah , " " " " Olay , " the run , " which you can still hear in the corrids or in the floor in the floor flamp .
In Spain , when a artist has made something impossible and magic , " Allah , words , " Allah , " I was , " Blah , I was going to do , " I 'm going to go back , " Ausually , I 'm God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But the problem is the next day , for the dance , in the day , you wake up and discover that are the 11 of the morning of Marteday , and I 'm not there .
It 's just a mortal with mortal ginock , and maybe it will never never longer to lift that allow along that ality .
And maybe nobody sought the name of God still while , and what it has to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most paincity to make in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angoscious if you can 't believe , the most extraordinary , that the most extraordinary aspects of your being being from yourself .
But you just think that 's a furnity-imaginable source of this squisity part of your life that you have to get to someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think it all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly as I thought , for a different months of the book that I 'm going to publish , I 'm going to do that , spent , spent , I 'm going to following it , I 'm going to follow my great successful .
And what I have to keep out when I feel elected by this is , not having it .
It 's just not to go . It 's just your work .
It turns out to you , any part , any of any part , any possessence to be .
If your work is balling , balance .
If the divine , lisurgery to leave some kind of wondered to leavar some kind of wonderful , for one moment through your sforced , then "
Otherwise , you do the same dance .
" Ole ! "
I think it and I think it 's a lot of it .
" On the same , even for the same , only for having love to love and test aggin the way to make you continue .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : On !
You know , you know , some of these projects on the human genome , about what it is to significant and the discovery of genes .
Now we 're starting a new pushing : we started digitalized biology and now now now to start to start to the digital code we 're entering in a new phase of biology , designing and synthizing life .
We 've always been trying to bring big questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists I think they have a lot of lifts .
We tried different approved , reduced to the minimal terms .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to move from the analogical world of biology in the digital world of the computer digital world .
Now we wonder , we can we regenerate life , or new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome that they can authoreum in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to make one more more smaller .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of the genes of about 500 that I 'm here .
But when we look at her metabolic mape , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
I think that 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very improbable that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to progrew was synthesize this cromosome of modify to modify some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " " Can we synthetize a cromosom ? "
It can be able to produce these big molecules that we never never able to make these big molecules that we 've never able to create before we 've ever able to create before ?
And in case , we can we make a cromosome cromosom ?
A chromosome is just a piece of chemistry material .
The speaker that we 're able to digitalize life is growing to exponential .
Our ability to writing the genetic code , instead of , it 's a lot of slowly slowly , but it 's improving .
And our more recently recently reporting the exponential curve .
We 've been started over 15 years ago .
The process has required a lot of pass , beginning with a bioetic review before we began to the first experiments .
But we found that that synthesize that 's very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of the world machines that are producing small segment of DNA , the long equipment of 30 to letters and it 's a degenerative process : more than the segment is longer , there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assembly these fragments and run the errors .
And this was our first attempt , to start by digital information information the genome of Phi X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills kills .
We 've been designed the correction of the error , and we had a molecule of DNA , about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is , when we press this chemistry of chemistry , and we put it in the bacteria , bacteria , bacteria have started to read this genetic code and product particles .
The viral particles have been releft by the cell , they 're back and they destroyed .
I talked about that the oil industry tells that they have certainly compressed them that they have certainly compress that they have certainly compress .
They remember .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his hardware can actually build his hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the bigger things .
We wanted to build the whole cromosom of the bacterium .
It 's more than 580 miles letters of genetic code .
So we thought of building it in the size of the viruses , so that we can change the casses to understand what the seven of the living of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accurate accurate standards was a mistake for every 10 miles .
We found that , we resequency , 30 mistakes . If we had used that original sequence , we would never be able to do that .
One part of the process is designed for long , long , and in the way that they 're survive with all other segments of 50 letter letter to build smaller subunity , they work together .
We 'll go to the only one here .
You probably have a bed that we put it on the floor of floor .
Think , we have a genetic code on four letter . A , C , C , G and TG .
Three of those letters together with about 20 friendly 20 minoacids , and there 's a specific order to each amount of reading .
So we can use genetic code to writing words , framework , framework ,
What we did about the beginning was autographed .
Some have been delivered by the fact that it wasn 't poem .
We 've been designed these segments to just unable them to be able to untruly untruly until it .
There are the enzymes that are repair them and put them assimed .
And we started assembly to the parts , beginning with segments from five to seven miles , unended to seven miles , in a way to make it a segments of 24 mile letter .
We have a step of the sequence of the pattern that we 're trying to make a very craft to sequence that we 're trying to create a very robustood -- like you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this looks like the tabellon a basket playoff .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 mila , more than 100 mila , they 're not going to grow more directly in the Ecoli .
You go to the modern limit of the modern biology .
So we 've been looking at other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called the homologa , which in biology to recombination , which in biology to repair DNA able to une segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiococcus , it can absorbed three million rad rad of radiation .
You can see in the superior like his chromosom as his chromosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly like it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms are completely section .
They can live under a vacuum .
It 's absolutely certainly life in space , and you move to find new environments of water .
In fact , NASA has shown that this happens .
This is a picture of the molecule that we 've built using these processes , just using the least design of the segments of the segments that we need to insert .
The least assemble them authically .
This image was not taken with a microscope electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a lot of the big tremendous that we can see it with a law microscope .
These are pictures that they cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publish that we did .
It 's more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a definitely defined structure of the man .
It has a weight molecular superior to 300 million .
If we stop it with a 10 without spaces , it would like 142 pages , it would just like 142 pages to transform this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it work ?
Of course , you love a viruses is a young girlfriend .
It 's a little more complicated when they use bacteria .
It 's easier , even when it 's eucariote as our : you can just just extract the nucleus and inside the nucleus and inserious one , which is basically the clonation of clonation .
In the bacteria , the battery is instead of integrated inside to the cell , but we have recently demonstrated that we 're able to make a transplant transplantly a cell of a cell and activity .
We 've got a cromosom parting from a microbial species .
The two are different as the mouse from the tops .
We add some gene in more way that we can decide that you could be choose for this chromosom .
The later sentence , with the encies to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell cell was study -- and you 'll open our sophisticatogist -- the new cell cell cell cell .
And we were thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to spend more in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that many species , they 've been added a second or a third romosom , to add a second thousands of new tracks to that species .
So who think about evolution as a only gene to the way that modies doesn 't understand biology .
There are the encies called restription that advantage of restription that they 're diger-ashed required .
The cell cell that was in the cell doesn 't have one .
The cell phone that we have inserious cell that we have inserit-h-----cell cell .
It 's expressed , and recognized the other chromosome , like the expressed material , and we were recognized with only the cell and the new cell cell cell .
It became blue because of the genes we 've been insered .
And in a short leave of time , all the characteristics of a species , they went to a new species , and we turned into a new species , based on the new species , we 've been serious in the cell .
All the proteins are changed , membranks are changed , and when we read the genetic code exactly what we 've been transfers .
Now , this could seem alchemy genetics , but it 's high DNA software , we can change things in the way , in a pretty sustained enough .
Now , I 've already explained that here is not talking about genesis -- but we progress to three million years of evolution , and I 've already said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian where it will come to new version of the digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty obvious when we think of our necessities .
We 're going to spend from six billion and a half of people in the next 40 years .
Right to give you an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 ; there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicinal and walks for six billion people .
It will be more driven to it to be more driven .
We use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion baries of oil .
That means millions of bird lead to the day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to reduce them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to hold all the hemiddle of CO2 from these materials that end into the atmosphere .
And so thanks to scientific discoveries around the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they are designed for the future .
The electronics that only has a dozen about a dozen about components , and you think about how many different things were come out .
Our limits here is major biological and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , thanks to these methods of synthesization , able to create what we call genomics combinatory genomics .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million cromosomes a million cromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes of different genes or to try to get the processes of processes , and we can change , we can change , thank you , we can change , thank you , thank , to create more biology .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can pick up for the possibility of survive , chemical or fuel , production of the etc , production of the etc .
This is a few instantly stantaneous stand-programmed instantly to seat and design species to the computer .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly what it is their genetic code .
Now we 're now concentrating on the fifourth of the generation .
You 've seen that that experiment from the grate was a finished experiment .
We have a lot of depending on the third generation that will be surround-up with fuels than the higher value as the opt-value kinds of butanol .
But the only way biology can have a great impact without increasing more impact than the food and limitarne of food and limitarne of the food and limitarne of the food and limitarguitar , we 're working on for the way we 're working on for designing cells that can reach , and we think we can have the first coal of the first ones that can be able to about 18 months .
The light sunlight slightly with CO2 is a methodown-to-out of the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we have described in 1996 .
It lives in the ocean deep , about 2500 feet of the deep of the water deep of the water .
They 're metane they 're using the molecular hydrogen molecular energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can incanalone , which can be transported by the way , it can be transported by the CO2 in the fuel , to drive that CO2 in the middle , to drive this process .
So we can think that we could be able to increase what the basic question of the basic question of the basic question , " We have the way , versus -- we have the mod-obic goal of reduce the whole industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do that from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And we 're working on using the same metods to create vaccines .
You 've seen this year with influence , we 're always back to a year and a year , and a dollar in less when it 's truly ,
I think that that that you can change building combination in a very hard .
Here 's how the future could start to look at change , now , the tree of evolution , accelting the evolution with synthetic bacteria , arrats , archy , and I 'm finally incellur .
We 're a lot of the people .
Our purpose is to do enough to live enough to try to make it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'll do you see , the most rapidly possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we 've been brought to the Microsoft soft in the way , exactly a year ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment that you can interact is to local level that remote a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of digital gabyte photos with a kind of zoom and continuous , for a panoramic speaking , disponing the images like we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these are the data or the images of data or the images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this is a scan example of the vent from Biblic Congress , and reherself in the leg of 300 megapie .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of a system like this is the number of playing , in any time . It 's an architecture . It 's an architecture very flexible .
This is a whole book , example of data not not images .
This is the Dickens of Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
And to show you that it 's just a test and not images , we can do something like this , to make a real thing that 's a real representation of the test , not a photographs .
It could be a little bit artificial to read a book .
It 's not a recognize .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the Wardian .
Every big image is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and beautiful experience of a reversion or a quotic revist or a quotidian , which is for nature a moltice .
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of the The Guardian .
We created a fashion advertising -- much more than that that you use in a normal advertising -- and we put you in a normal advertising -- and we put you in the extra of the content .
If you want to see the carpet of this automobile , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even the techniques .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to election limits of space on the screen .
We hope that this means to put the pop-up and other pop-up with other pop-up symiles , not to be necessary .
Of course , the mapplications is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if we don 't say that we have contributes to the field .
These are all the streets in the United States . It was a geospaces on a NASA .
So we 're going to go to something else .
This is now actually the vive of the wild-alive ; you can go to see .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadron and the other is a visual research a visual research on the computer , a student of the University of Washington , with the aid of Steve Steve Steve Szeliskelisker , in the U.S. . " It 's a good good hesearch .
And it 's from Seadrun , gested by Seadragon .
You can see that when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one image to another and have this kind of experience . And the other kind of experience .
But the space of the images here has actually a meaning meaning .
The algorithms of visualization of the computer recorded these images , so that they running the place that the images that you can see the place that the images -- all screenced up the Grassi on the Montagrees -- they 're taken . So , you 're going to see the elements of a lide-gamic gamic gorithms of the computer split , and these things are all the space .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space .
I want to spend up one of the original data of Noahhhimself -- and this is from a prototype of Photosynthree-to-extent of the first time we 've made it to work for the first time , the technology , Photosymphhlashing , technology Photosymphimself , looking at the environments we 've been doing the site that we 've been doing the site that we 've been put in the site that we 've got in the website .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame images from Flickr . Baast Flickr . Baast Dame in Flickr and you get images of the fields , other of the campus , other of the campus , other trust represents a picture of the image that is discovered a images that it 's discovered to this model .
So they 're all images from Flickr and were all linked to the space space space that way .
And it 's possible to navigate this way simple .
You know , I won 't have thought about it for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying this kind of accoaudience here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of different kinds of phones that are the phones in the phones , SLR , a number of the professional phones , a significant significant number , put together in this environment .
And if I can go to , I 'm going to try to see those strange .
There 's a lot of faces , etc .
Some part here you have a series of photographs -- here .
This is a Notre poster Dame recorrectly .
We can spend from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This now is taking data from the entire memory -- from the entire memory of the ground , from visual point of view -- and connected all those data together .
All those pictures become , more than the som of parts .
You have a model of the land that emerging .
Think about this as a such of Stephen Laaauner on the virtual Earth .
It 's something that growing up in complex as people who are using it , and the antages that are the way to grow the use of the use .
Their pictures are hames with other people .
If someone is the idea of the idea of the things that we have a telling of the name , my picture of Notre of the chthedral of all that data , and I can use this data , and I can use as a way of ingressed in space , in that metaphor , in that metaphing the way , and have a cle-moed social experience of cross-mo-like social , and red an extent of the red mobile red .
Of course , a consequence of all that are virtual models of any interesting , the other interesting models of the earth , and you 're not just lights from satellitaries and similar images , but from the collective memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software is going to hear us to do is that a certain point in the next years , all the photographs , all the photographs , everyone in the whole world will be linked together ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is basically discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the basis of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the recurcity of semantic information that many of these images can be able to do .
As you get a research of images on the web , you digits a frase and the text on the web has a lot of information about the picture of the picture .
Now , what if that pictures you connected to all your pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection and semantical interconnection and the amount of recheck that is really huge . It 's a huge effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible .
BAA : thank you very much .
One of the major pleases when you travels and one of the research of the ethnographics that has no forget the anti-traditions , between the anti-traditions , the wind the wind , the wind the wind , the wind in the leaves of plants .
Basti think that Jaguar traveling over the Via Lattea , or that the Inuit 's still travels , or that the mitites are still meaningful , or in Himalayas , the good display , to remember the importance of the Dharma , to remember the importance of the world , and the idea that the world that the world that we live in absolute , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of adaptations that our strope has done , good or a lot of generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracks .
All we do . All we do .
We 're subjects to realive .
We have to deal with inexorability of death , so it doesn 't surprise and we 're going to be saying , and we 're standing ,
We all have an art .
What hits is the particular rhythm is the particular of the song of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they 're the think of the forests of the Borneo , or the following of the Haiti , or the Haiti of the desert Khya settt in Kenya . And the Curererert of the Sahara .
He was my traveled companion the desert a month ago , or a huge of yak , or a yak , in the Everest , the dead of the world .
All of these people teaching us that there are other ways of exists of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of model in the world .
And if you reflect a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
And we 've been in the world 's cultures of the world creating a spiritual life of the world creating a spiritual and cultural that we fly the planet , and it 's important to the well-being as a biological life as biosphere .
And you can think about this cultural ragela cultural ethnosphere , and you can define the so-called the total nosphere , mites , inspirations , mad , inspirations , inspirations , inspirations , inspiration , inspiration , inspiration ,
The etnosphere is the patrimony of human human .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be as a species .
And because biosphere was free by consumed by the way , it was actually consumed to the ethnosfree and purpointing much more rapidly .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all the species has been or about the oref of the extinction , because it 's false -- in the most apocalypocalypocalypocaly-pocalypocalm -- and you don 't even even close to the most optimistic of the world 's cultural .
The indication of all that is , of course , the language of the indication .
When you 're born existed 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not only composed by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
One language is the spraper human spirit .
It 's the middle of which the animal of every culture is coming in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a little bit , a thought , a spiritual ecosystem of the spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , while we sat Monterey , at least half of the kids .
They 're not going to teach children , which means , unless you won 't won something , unless won 't willing .
What is more sad than being the silence of the silence , to be the last thing to talk a language , not to have a language , not to have a way of wisdom or anticipate the promise of children ?
This remember was someone in some part of the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , a high , a high , the last syllabs of a ancillables .
And I know somebody say , " Isn 't it anymore ?
The world would not be a better place if we 're talking to all the same language ? " Well , we 're all yorba . We talk to all yorba .
We 're talking kogs .
You 'll cover a tract thing that you can 't talk to the language .
Today I 'd like to do a journey through the lect-bad --
a little journey in the etnosal journey to give you a little bit of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of existing really different ways of exists . "
Let 's take for example this baby Barasana , Amazon , the settle-a-a-wills , which creds the middle of the waste of the west of the waste of the swest of the site of the sandscape .
It 's a popular that 's not able to distinguish the blue color , because it 's the blue is identified in the time , which is the popular popular .
They have a strange language and a mathematical rule , detes , " you have to move a different person that you have to talk a different person who talked to a different person who talked a different language .
All that has radical in the past Mitological , but the particularity is that in these families that are in these families that are talking six or seven language of mitological marriage .
They 're all all to listen and then start to talk .
Let 's take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waorani Waorani Ecuador , a popular popular popular that has been the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have taken a commit by commit to a facal error .
They did not seen that photographs that were there in a popular populating friendly , forget that this populating populating , that this populating populating populating that this popular population never saw bi-dimensional bi-dimensional popular .
They collaped the photographs , they spent the research of a shape , and not by the way , they 're not going to anything , they 're going to be treated with the hillance .
But the Waorani not only killed the straneous straneously .
They killed in their own .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by their same .
We 're rising at eight generations and found two cases of natural death and we found two death of them , they 've been able to know , they 've been told that one of them , and then they killed it . And they killed it . And they killed it .
The crawings were able to recognize the animal urina from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early ' 80s , I was assigned a very interesting task when my professor of Harvard asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti in the first grant society and truly impossessing in the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and impossessare in the speed of the speech , and impossessing me .
To give a sense of miraculous , I would have to understand the Vodoun culture and that Vodoun 't magic .
It 's pretty much than a complex metaphysics of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to say the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianesimum , Islam , Budddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent comes up , thinking that Africa is not the sub-Saharan Africa has not been religious figure . And instead of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts that we have been able to the tragic tragic wahs .
What makes the interesting voodoor is the intense of life and death .
So , you know , the spirits are naked .
The spirits can be invited by the Great Acqua , they respond to the dance of dance and they strow temporary to the soul of the vive way that for a brief the way that for a brief of the following following .
So , the voodooists love to say , " You 're white white the gather .
We say in the temple and divention the temple and divention . "
And from the moment that you 're going to drive you , how can you do you get the bad ?
So you 're going to these incredible events : following voodoor in the state of trance that touch impununununits of the power of mind , when it 's catalyzed in a state of the power of mind , when it 's cataled in a state of extreme extreme .
Of all the people who have lived the most extraordinary of the most extraordinary are the Kogi Nevada de Sierra Nevada de Sierra Nevada in Colombia .
To sending of the anticized civilization that once living on the planning of Colombic , the popular bought of the conquirt , the popular popular wildlife that you 're on the planture .
In a macchieved of blood , this popular never been conquirted by the spagged to the spagnolious .
And now , they 're governed by a clero but their formation is decided to be extraordinary .
The young people are coming out of the families to three or four years , and they live secreated in a world made of good homs and homs in a world made of the basic foot and hours in a world made of 18 years .
Two periods of nine years of proposed to reduce the nine months of gestation that spend in the mother , now are metaphically in the mother of the Great Mother .
So , that time , they 're acculturned to the values of their society , values that they are predict and only their predict and their predict their own package -- or to say the balance of their ecological .
At the term of this incredible beginning , they 're improvisually taken out and for the first time in their life , at the age of 18 years , they see a high . And in that account of the first cutters , when the soles of the beautiful valley , when the sole is confermention the way , everything that they learned in the splendor , everything that they learned in the preciate . The preciate of the beautiful thing , and he says ,
" Do you do that ? As I said .
It 's study . Now it 's now to protect it . "
It 's called the major brothers and say that we , brothers , we are the minor of the destruction of the world .
This is intuition is extremely important .
When we think of the Indigene and environment , we 're in Resau and the old story of the noble , which is a razy , which is a razy , which is a razy , and we say that these populations are close to the Earth of us .
The Ingenies are not feeling or indebulites from the nostalogy .
There 's no space for these things in the disease in malaria of the Aststin the winds of the Tibet , but thank you , at the time and I think , created a mistics of the Earth 's based on the end of the Earth 's known , but on a balugly such the most such of the world can only live in the world . It can only live in the consciousness of human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
It 's a guy that a boy of the Ande that the mountain is a spirit Apu that mountain Apu that will drive his destiny is a human destiny , and it 's going to have a fun of a humans , or that place in the Montana , and that place it 's a gammas of the Montana , and it 's a massive , a wind mass of the Montana who are taking .
That 's the dimora of a spirit or a mineral mineral was irrifying .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the report between individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Britannica credating that the forests service for being cut .
And that 's made me a human being a different from my friends Kwakiutl that believe the forests are the demate of Hukukukuk and the hukuk stort of the paradise and the downers that live in the northern world , spirits that live in the beginning .
If you start to consider that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some their sensors . We can make these plant sensitive things . We 'll make this plant .
I took this picture to open in the nordoctor in the nordoctor .
Mayahash some of you heard about the ayahash , the most powerful such of the scious repertorium of the sciamanic repertorium .
What makes the ayahash is not the potential of the physical potential of the suddenly , but her elaboration . It 's composed to two elements . It 's two elements .
From a hand , this liana lawnice that containing a series of rather , harmine and harmine , a lot , slightly hallucinogens .
To take the only plant , you have a blue fum that alters a little bit the consciousness , but it 's miscale of a family said , with the leaves of a family said , " South chotridis .
This is a triple powerful triptamine , very similar to the seroxyltryltryltrypamine-thoxypamine-thoxypamine .
If you ever see Yanomami , you 'll see Yanomami , that make a different set of species , it 's methoxyptiny methoxyptiny .
Tirating that polls on the nurse is a little bit like being sparked by a fire saved depink , and land-up a deal of electricity . It 's not creates a distortion of reality .
I had often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who has taken the psychedelic was psychedelic , with his discovery of the fungus in Mexico .
I think it can 't classify these triptchines , because if you 're not told , because if you 're not told . You can 't tell anybody to be hallucinated . And they can 't be hort . And they can 't be horly , because they 're money from a such a enentire that you can 't be hororse , because they 're course , in the extent , in the extent , detaxed by a objin-ow-odamy-oamy-oamin-oam-owned .
It 's possible to be absumerely if you 're just a little bit of the chemical chemical that denaturate MAO .
Now , the beautiful : the dramatic , that is in this liana are injums of MAO , of the same kind of the same kind of need to power the triptamines . The question is spontaneous question : in a four-of-death , like this guy is such a version of biochemical dead , but that if you combine , it 's such a version that is summmmate the time to the som of parts ?
We use the great eusual ef of proof and error , which can reveal infruit .
But if we ask the Indians , they 're going to tell us , " The plants talking . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , the Cfan , 17 varieties of the ayahuasks , which we 're going to our eyes from the same species .
If we wonder how they 're going to do their tells us , they 're going to tell us , " I thought of plants , you know , I don 't know everything ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take the 17 varieties in a night of ball and each night to a different craft .
With this is not a huge to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that to count stami stami .
Now , there 's the problem is that even the ones that have heart heart the people who have heart heart populs are pittoreses , but in some way you can reduced you have a lot of history in our real world , and it 's along .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it will not remember for his innovations , but rather like the innovations , but rather like the era that we were stopped and we used across the destruction of the planet . Now , the destruction of the planet . Now , it 's not the problem is change .
All cultures through the secezes have been involved in a dance for new chance of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux didn 't stop being Sioux when they put it out of the arch and further and further like American have been American when they 're stopped by horse and calated .
It 's not the change of technology that minaccounts the integrity of the ethnosal .
The flight over the domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you 'll find that these are not cultures cultures are not cultures to disappear .
They 're creating living and dynamics dynamics out of identify identify that they 're beyond their ability to their adaptation .
Which you 're disboscening in the patria of the Penan --
a popular nowed in Sarawak , in the sud-west popular popular , a popular popular popular , and now reduced to the servitos and prostitution about the river of the river of the river of the river of the river of the light-floor in the Merierday , where the window of the Merian Cerdiond-Carasions , where the navels the horizon-up the horizon-asions ,
To you get the standing to the wooown-up woown-forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that are come with the discovery of the gold .
If we 're going to move on the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard of the political domination .
As you know the genocide , physics , the physics of a popular popular , but the destruction of the lifetnocide , the destruction of the lifetnocide , it 's not only not conditions , but it 's not conditions , because it 's part of the strategy of development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet from the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in the Western China through the suddgets , by by coming to Lhasa to Lhasa hasa , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what we 're going to hear about .
6,000 sacres sacred you to polgen and cencounters .
1.2 million people killed by the military during the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was absolutely at the Panchen Lama .
That means that it 's been killed to the template of Chinese invasion .
His , it 's smot with Santity . Feally during the diaspora that has taken popular popular in Nepal .
Her mother was impressed and her colliver was recognize .
It was taken to hide a land-a-year-old age of two years , under his leg because he couldn 't live without him .
The sister , which has made the same , was put in the field of reeducation .
One day has been switch a day , a fashion Mao and , for this transgression , has been put to the works for seven years .
The pain the Tibet can be inexpensive , but the spirit of the popular popular is from the present .
At the end , all you reduce to a choice .
We want to live in the world monocromatical world , or we want to account the world policicromal world ?
The great anthropologa Margaret Mead , before he die said that her biggest later was that , in our go to this vision of the world , we 're not only seeing the whole gamm of human imagination to a human imagination to a limitated modality of thinking , but one day we 'll be able to wake up from a sone-menting wake up to us from a sone-menting pertively of the other possibility .
And it 's umillion of remember that our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Neolitics , which gives us the agriculture , which made us to fight us , which made us to the seed cult , and we 're able poem in the poem of the chlery , creating the gerarchy of the specialization , and we 're talking about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has been 300 years .
That 's a story that we have to do not suggests that we have the answers to all the answers to all the challenges that we should be able to do .
When these mirist of the world is asked what it is asked to be human , respond to 10,000 different voks .
And it 's in these answers that we all rises the possibility of being what we are : a kind of a conscious , which has to make all the people and all the gardes can truly truly . And there 's great moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the northrow of the island of Baffin , when I went to hunt hunt hunt of the Inuit , Olaya , he told me the wonderful story of her grandfather .
The government candian is not always gentle with the Inuit and the 1950s to stick our premise , we have rink them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refuted to go there .
The family , I 'm told for his life , and all his attened , and all his attention .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't teach cold , exploit .
The slites in origin the origin was made of fishing wild-up cartoon the skin .
The grandfather than this man didn 't intimise from the arctic or the libraries that was suffered .
It 's gaahead , it 's calculated the skin skin in the skin and defected in your hand defected in their hand defected in the focused to it .
He spred on the door of this ction , and when it became solid , it 's killed a dog .
He waves the dog and created a brid , with the households created a sliterally , he had another dog , and it 's disappeared on the banker , collide in the remained .
We want to talk about that , with nothing ? [ Rate ] . And this , in different ways , in different ways , [ Applaushes is the symbol of the Inuit and all the Indious popular popular people in the world .
In the test 1999 , the canader government sauce has redied in the total control of a bigger area of the bigger California and Texas the mad together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's a dependent territory . They 're all the miner-independent rewards .
One splendidge example of how a nation-state can remember with his popular .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious at least at least who of us was in these remote washes of the planet , it 's not remote .
For someone is home .
They represent sections of the human imagination that are treating at the time . And for us all , the dreams of these kids , like the dreams of our children , become part of hope .
For finally , we 're convinced to the politicians will never get to arrive to the politicians will never get to nothing .
We believe that the polemies --
[ Applauses are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the world , and maybe we 're the best institution of the world . Ogen our website .
156 countries transmit our television .
Our revivives are literally .
Our work is traveling in the etnosphere to bring our audience in a wonders of cultural places that they 're going to go out out and , hopefully , good time for the central revealed by the way , the central revealed of the world 's exists to exists in a world of life in a world plurala world plurala world and multicultural .
where the wisdom of all the people can contributing to our well-being collective .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things that I 've written in this book that I hope you 've already heard and try to get some links , in the case not nothing .
I want to start with what I call " the dogma offical . "
The dogma official dogma is ?
The dogma official of all the industrial society . The dogma dogma is , " If we want to massive to do our citizens " The way to do it 's massive to do the individual freedogen . "
The reason is , from a hand , in the fact that freedom is in the same value , it 's precious , useful , it 's precious , useful , of the liberty .
On the other is that if we 're free , each of us can act for all that we can do everything that massive our well-being , without any one that decide in our well-being , without any one that decide in our well-being ,
The way to massive freedom is massive to massive freedom .
More choice people , more are free , more than liberty , and more liberty is their well-being .
This , I think , it 's so deeply radicked in society that nobody would dreams to be able to doubt .
And it 's also deeply radicked in our lives .
I 'm going to show you a few examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly great .
I 'm a simple note about the conditions for injective .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without content the 10 of oil extravels of oil , and 12 acetes , and 12 acetes that you can buy to make you a huge number of conditive in the surrounds that nobody of 175 already is to be your degree .
Here 's what 's the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronics to buy a stereo stereo : CD , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio , radio ,
And in this single negoties of electronics , there 's a great number of audio components .
We can make six million and a half of different combination using the components that there are only in a only one negoties in a store .
You 've got to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Other trust : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the desive services , and they were shape , to the pat that moment of the mom Bell .
It was given the phone , not buy it .
One of that , between the other , was that the phone was that the phone was never romped .
These template .
We have a variety of the phones , especially in the phones .
Here 's the phones of the future .
My favorite is the middle , MP3 , touches , and the burning of the nass , and the burn to the burn one else .
If you don 't even know that you 've seen in the negoties , you 're going to be able to the end .
And what the end is that people entered in the negoties in the negoal . And you know what the answer is the answer ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do that too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the acquific aquences , the same explosion of choices .
Ausequence : it doesn 't happen in the United States that you go from the doctor and the doctor , you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " Okay , we could do A , or B , " A " Be has these benefits and these risks . " Big these risks . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Dottice , what I should do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , B has these benefits and these benefits . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebats : " Dotter if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : But I 'm not her . "
The result of the disease , we call it " autonomy , expression that it looks like a great thing .
But it 's actually not that a moment of move the fish and responsibility of the decisions of someone knows something , you know , to someone else 's doctor , to somebody else -- and so not in the ideal condition to make the patient .
There 's a huge marketing of products , directly , directly people like me and you , that if you think it 's not a sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do it , because they 're public ?
The answer is that they want to doctor in the morning of the doctor to ask them to change the recipe .
Something that is the fundamental as our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this vignize , like we don 't want to force kids . They 're not going to prove their children . Sceat their sex at that right now . " We need to invent . We need to invent .
And we can reinvent us how many times we get us .
That means that every morning , at the time , you have to decide that kind of person wants to be .
It 's spect to the family and marriage , a time time , the communicate , under the time , it was that you could be able to do the most than as well , and he was that he was going to square .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not not not when , and not not even what to do after .
And it 's really to play .
I 'm going to teach very smart , and I 'm 20 percent in less work than a time .
And not because they 're less bright , because they 're not less diligent .
but why am I impensierites , I mean , I should walk or not ? I should walk or not ? "
" Would I wish to get to you ? I 've got to think before the fear of the fear ? "
They 're interrogative interrogative .
And they 're trying to answer to these questions , even though this implessing not to completely get the task of the extent that achieved and not get a beautiful vote to my extent .
And they have to do that . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl underlucky , because the technology allows us to work every minute , every day , every day , from every day , from every day , by every day , by the Hotel Randolph .
It was a parently , there 's a corner , and not say to anybody who , where the WiFi works .
I don 't say that I want to use it .
What does , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about the work ? It 's continually decide , we have to keep , by continually , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son son playing , with the phone phone in a tax , Blackberry in the other , and the notea , and the noteteteam , on the ginock .
And even though they 're all spent , every minute that we see our son , we also see our son , we 're also asking , " Do you say , " I have to say , " Do you know , " I 've been asking , " I 'm also asked , " I have to say , " Do you know , we also see our son , we also see our son , we 're also as
" Do I have to say that email ? I 've got to hold this letter ? "
And also when the answer is no , " that makes the experience of your son dought-toy , it makes a lot different than what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the things we look , little , things , big things , and the things of life , life is a question of choices , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Ovous , there were some possibility , but not all was a question of choice .
The world today is this : The dilemma is : The dilemma is a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is , it 's Shouseholds .
The positive we all know , so I 'm going to talk about the negative ones .
All this choice two effects two effects of people .
The first one , paradoxally , is that produces instead of liberation .
With the options that you choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I 'm going to give you an example , a study study of volunteer than the flight of the volunteers .
A colleague has had access to the data of the Vandish , the giant society of the funding of the funding of the funding of the funds , in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the hundred adesion , the middle of two percent .
With 50 source of offering , there 's 10 percent in less adesions than it is only five percent of it 's only five percent . Why ?
Because with 50 sources of the whom , is maledly hard to decide , and the choice is to decide , and the choice is remainly remainly .
And at questions , and again , questions , questions , questions , and of course , questions never come up .
You know that it doesn 't only only only mean that these workers are going to hate food for cans because they 're not going to say that the decision is so ostics that the decision is so ostics that they 're lose the decision is so ostics that they 're also going to be a deal with the dator of the work of the dator of the work of the work of the dator of the work of the work of the work of the dator of the work of the work of the datories of work of the work of the dattempt of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work of the work
It 's not by by the way , they 're losing to five dollars from the dator of work , which would be really disposed to be versary them .
So the paralysis a consequence of the having too much choices .
And I think it makes the world .
" And finally , for eternity : ketchup , or maionese ? "
You just want to take the right decision , if it 's for the eternity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong source , and or or the cut condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoid the paralysis , and make a choice , we 're not sitting from the result of how we would be with less options of what we would have been taken with less options of which choose .
And that 's that for different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions that you would be better . If you buy one , you know , it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us industry , and the reduce of the scale , and the reduce the recognize of the recognized ,
And even when it was a good decision .
More choice is , more , it 's easier is easy to dispileverage that it 's inseasn 't exactly the option of the choice .
And there is what economists call it constood called the opportunity .
Dan Gilbert asked a lot of stamaine as the value we 're going to the things about what we 're doing .
In the rest , when there are a possibilities , it 's easy to represent the extremendous characteristics of the option that you have been taken .
Here 's an example . I school with all the people who are not New York .
But that 's what you probably think .
There 's this couple to the Hamptons .
A place place of lussed .
It 's beavailed . Oten day . It 's all driven for them .
Not anything . But what he thought he 's thought , " Well , malth , malth , it 's Augost . "
" All my neighbors at Manhattan is . "
" I could talk to it right in front of house . "
And it 's going to two weeks , from the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The decreures decrease the suddenly for what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And more than the options that we have to consider the more than the characteristics that we 're going to be reverse as a constantly opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This vignize us a lot of things .
It 's about living the moment , and maybe living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you won 't do other .
The things that we don 't choose to be active attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : it 's growing the expectations .
I tried it on my skin beating a new couple of jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were only a kind of a kind of a kind of bestivestivestivestivan , they were dissiversus , just after they brought them a lot of times , they started going to go well .
So , I went to buy a new when the old old those old were , and I said , " I 'm a couple of jeans , this is my wrong . "
The fit said , " You want to want to me to do it , fit relaxed me ? "
Do you want to the cernight or with the bottons ? " Stonewashed , " or " action ? "
" Do you want to strapplied ? "
" Soth them wants to share , you know , " Bla bla bla , " Bla bla eleneneneneneneneneneneneneneneneneneneneneneny .
I was saying , and after a little bit , and after a little bit , I could say , " I want the only kind of the kind of , " I want to do the only kind of the things that was , so for a hour jeans , I 'm trying to all of the jeans , and then using the best jeans , I had ever .
It was the moximum . I had the best .
But I felt that I felt .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was going to worse is that with all the choice of the aspectations were very high , jeans had to be perfect .
I was waited for me . I didn 't expect anything excited about it , when it was only a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of 100 different kind of , at least a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of
What I was doing was good , but not perfect .
After I had compared that I was trying to do what I was trying to involved in front of the expectations .
The add of the options in life doesn 't make the expectations that these are respond to the excellence of the options that these are excellence of the options of the options of the options of the options that these are excellence of the options that these are excellence of the options that these are respond to the excellence that these
And that will make less swimming , even when the results are good .
No one in the marketing world 's world 's connected .
Because if they know , you won 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth more about this .
" He was better when he was worse . " The reason why he was better when he was the worst , he was that when he was worse , he was still possible to meet surprised .
And in the world we live in -- opulent , industrialized , industrialized citizens with the perphysics -- we 're hoping is that the things are at the altitude of expectations .
You never have surprised to the detailable , because your expectations , the mie aspectations , are ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse expectations , " Yes , you want to . "
I mean , a little autobiographical moment -- that I 'm really sposed and my wife is really stupid .
I couldn 't do better , I didn 't have accounted .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of the jeans discover , when there 's only that when you 're just that kind of jeans is that when you 're not slights , and I said , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " " The answer is . "
The world is the responsible . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and buy a jeans , and you 're ask you , and you ask you who is the responsible , is the responsible , is the responsible , is the responsible , you .
You should do better .
With hundreds of available , there 's no willing for the insuccessful .
So when people are taking decisions , even though the result is walked , they feel involved in it , and they give the himself .
In the last few years depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but important -- that is the depression of the depression of the depression of the depression of the depression of the depresent people because standards are too high .
And when they 're explaining this situation think that collide is their .
So the end result is that in general , we 're better , obectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogma , what we all all take for good and it 's completely false .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is not a little bit better than it , but it 's not a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magical value . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been sure that we 've been on the level where the floor of the level ,
Now , from the political point -- I 've been finished -- from the political point of view , the political noccise is the following .
What 's the whole choice in industrial society is the rechness of material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you 're a lot of the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they 're too poor too poor .
So the faces that I 'm talking about is a disease of modern , remember the modern society .
And what does the arrand the arrand is this : Steve Levitt talked about how I 'm going to you 're going to talk about what it is and discovers for bs are inuuuuuuuuseful .
I mean these choices , complicated and dispenous , it 's not just inuseful .
They 're adaptope of the one .
They do it worst .
If a little bit of what in our society allows that was reversed in those where people are too few possibilities , it would not only be their lives as well , it would be better .
This is what economists call a parety-to-.
A redistribution of the recome in , not only the poor -- not only only the poor -- because of this choice in excess that we come back to us .
To conclude , " Let , you can get everything you want ,
You know , people of culture , you will think , " But what does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get anything in a wood boat . "
" A imagination imagination , a limited vision of the world --
And I 'm interpret this , at the beginning .
But then , think about it , instead , I realized that the fish is the longer .
Because the reality of fact is that if you 're saying the bocks , so that , " all you can 't get the freedom . " You 're not going to freedom . You 're all the paralsis .
If you 'll rock the bocks , you can diminuliites .
You 're going to go to the paralysis , and you reduce the well-being .
They all need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too much , maybe even for the fish , even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some symbooks sphere is a recipe for infection and , for roin the roin the grashes .
Thank you for heart .
