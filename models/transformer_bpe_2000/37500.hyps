I showed this year I showed these slides to show that the glacial glacial calots , which for almost three million years had the size of the United States continental , it 's refted about 40 percent .
But this subjected , this is the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the spending of the ice .
The artical calots is , in a sense , in a sense , the clean heart global climate system .
You expanding it to inverinter and you get sumer .
The next slide is going to be a quick carry on on the last 25 years .
The ice lost have signed in red .
You can see , you get up until the blue .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is the sumer .
You can see that the cosid-year-old ice , of five years or more , is like the blood , which is like blood , which is like blood , which is like blood .
In 25 years , he 's passed by this .
This is a problem because the scale of the interest in the ocean land , where there are a huge amount of coal coal that , switches , they 're transformed into the microbes .
I respect to the totality of the global atmospherical , that quantity could doubling , that quantity could doubling , superate this point of not .
In some deep in Alaska little deep in Alaska the metano is already rebulating out of the water .
The Katey Walter of Alaska Walter of Alaska , a team was a team in the winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You 're good . The question is if we 're going to be it .
A reason that this is that this termal exchange from the North .
This is a glacial river .
The brought never reached levels .
This is the Kangerlusaq , in the southwest in the South west .
If you want to know how the level of the sea level of the melting of the ice , here is where you get the sea .
These corrupt corrupt .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the biggest block of the planet .
The last month , the scientists have clearly running that the gets of the ice is in negative , and that Antarctica , which poor some of the islands , which poor some of the sea to be submarine .
Equival at six feet of the tape of the slightly like Greenland .
On Himalayas , the third biggest block , they see new laghi , which a few years ago were glaciers .
40 percent of the world population will remember half the water from the slightly population .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water source of this city .
The ported brought it .
But when it decreases , the same happens to the water .
In California , the snow on Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The backkkilled is in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , are floor .
The increasingly insuit in the world leads to a remarkable increase in the field .
The environmental disasters are increasing out of the normal and without precedented .
Four times more number in the last 30 years than the previous 75 years ,
This is a whole thing about all sustainable .
If you look at it in the storytellical consequences .
In the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons in the ocean every day .
Look at the Eastonist Pacific , the Americas , from the Americas , and on both west , and on both the parts of the subcontinent , where there 's a radical impoverise in the ocean .
The major because of global warming , and with the deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuel use .
The oil is a problem , and coal problem is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And it was proposed to build a lot of other central coal .
But we 're seeing in a direction of the way .
These are annoullated projects in the last few years and some proposes of alternative proposes .
And in each way , there 's a politics in our country .
The coal industry , and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year for promote coal year , which is an oxymold .
I reminds me something --
I saw Natale in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion gallers of coal gallers .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second biggest flow of scories in America .
It happened around Natale .
The nature of one of the coal industry was this .
Video : Simies , Frosty the carbon is a guy and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's going to grow our economy .
Frosty carbon is increasingly public .
It 's good precisely , adorable and workers are kept the stypend .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest minerary society is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'll be clearly -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reesday -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleness for the Proteition of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Atter : ALergy see the climate change as a serious threat our business .
So our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a effort to a public and confused to make the truth and confused the truth .
In fact , coal is not sport .
We think it 's clean , we think it 's also good .
So not preodry about climate change .
Let 's do it .
Video : Atter : Carbone -- you 've heard a lot of them .
So let 's take a turn in a structure at the time for the clean , as well as coal public .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noise , but this is the sound of the technology of coal coal public .
The coal consumption is between main the global warming , but the global remarkable to see it changes .
Look at a look . This is the hodierna technology .
Al Gore : Finally , the positive alternative connects to economic question , and at the national security .
Video : Lowned is , America is in crisis ; the economy , national security ,
The rode that the flows that we have the fossil fuels , like coal fuel and oil of the most important oil .
Now , there 's a new , audace solution for it .
Repower America : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A pian to restop America to work , make sure sure , and help us stop the global warming .
Finally , a solution that you 're going to solve our problems .
Repower America . Scover more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Commment : It 's about re-in-of-of-in-America .
One of the fastest ways to get the dependence on the dependence that they killed our planet .
What 's the future is here . I feel here . I don 't , soles , a new energy web .
What about two : Noves that are investment for work , well ,
Commment : Repower America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A veckey to proverbial African says , " If you want to go to the fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go far , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED speculation on the LHC .
And I promise to fix it on how the car works .
So here I am . And for those that the other time there were no LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever -- 27 kilometers of circumference .
His to remember the conditions that were less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
And this is just environment .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
We were pictures these mini-Big Bang in the relatively .
This is what I work . This is called ATLAS -- is a large 44 feet . It 's a 22 meters .
This is a spectacular image of ATLAS in building , so you can see the proportions .
Ten September 10 last year we have accese the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was immense of a huge festern in control room .
It 's a picture of the first particles that had all the turn of the LHC , and then in collision , by a part of the LHC , and spread particles in the rate .
In other words , when we see that image 10 10 , we found that picture 10 September , we knew that machine worked , which is a great victory .
I don 't know if this was this to be exultent more or that , when someone went to Google and saw the beginning was this .
That means we had a cultural impact on the scientific impact .
And a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to these dored here -- these dored damn dored .
These rights are 13,000 amps when the machine works at the power of power .
Now , the technicians between you will look at the boys and say , " That 's not true . I 'm too sounds . "
And they can do that because when they 're very cold slightly become the cosidfiles .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a inference temperature to that switch , these floating sits back .
In one of the kind of the juntures in the LHC , there was a fabrication of fabrication .
So the floating slightly , and the 13,000 amps suddenly inmet a electric resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnets more than 20 tons , and that have moved about 30 centimeters .
They have about 50 magnetets .
We had to take them , what we did .
We 've restined and adverted them .
Now they 're going back to their place over the ground .
I mean , the end of march the LHC will be again .
We 're going to accinate , and we expect to get the data to juggling to juggling to find out what the morning to find out what the universe is the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain quote , these accidents reaching the debate value and the engineering in the science and engineering . It 's easy to confestion .
I think that 's so hard to go beyond the limits , I think that 's the value of things like LHC .
I would like to conclude with a Ingan scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I think , in defense , in defense experiments of his pupilar , Michael Faraday , said , " Nithing is that it 's not a very dangerous for progress of human mind as the return that the ideas of are called as a realize that the ideas of are called , which is not in nature , and there are no mystery , and that there are no worth new worldwide .
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to think about when , from kids , you play with the morning .
And as you get to realize it as you get them and take them and move them , and you get them , and you learn to think and solve problems and sent relationships .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , as information as we 're inspired by the uslity of our interaction with physicists , and I started to do that , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only a computer , instead of having the both of the digital craft that we can take physically a computer on the desktop , we can deal with the information with both a desktop ,
and we 're going to sistemarge ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the answer , building the Siftable .
In a words , a Siftttan is a computer interactive computer like a cookie .
In a words , a Siftttan is a computer interactive computer like a cookie .
You can move them with the hand , they can see them , they can see the movement and they can see it .
But most of them , I 'm physical objects , like the morning , you can just move it .
Siftable is a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physical , conscious , awarens , the other , and as they become more physical , conscious , of how we move them , of how to move , we can explore new and different styles of interaction .
I 'll start with some simple example .
This Siften is configurated to show the video : if it 's a direction , the video rrunning that if you 're going to including it back back .
These interactive riting are aware of others .
If I say that I do , they 're interests in what they 're going to do .
If they 're circumits , they notice it and they can act a little bit .
If they 're circumits , they notice it and they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use of data , for example , to say , " a color like it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable as a secks and I can use them to put them together to put them in the central color in that central , where they mix .
and I can use it to put them in the central , where they mix .
We can be too much , we can put a little bit back .
There are also beautiful possibility of learning , like languages , like languages , and games where people can try to do the fast , and see the results immediately .
Now , I 'm --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a equations program .
We have a game of words that 's half between Scarabean and Boggle .
Pratically , at each turn a letter to remember a letter in each other Siftable , in every turn to be a letter in case , and while I 'm trying to get it in a dictionary .
And then , after about 30 seconds , you have a new set of reading and new chance to try .
Thank you .
So here 's children came to the Media Lab , I did so that they tried them and turned a video .
They 're very , very , they 're very .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people a lot of education .
You have to say , " I 'm going to do it . " And they know , they know exactly what to do .
Here 's how other people who are trying it .
This is our younger header tester , on the right there .
It actually wanted to ince them .
They were only brching morning , for him .
Now , this is an application of an interactive cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of the languages . And we wanted to build a tremendous .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving the Siftable , they can put Siften .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving the Siftable , they can put Siften .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is sunlight .
David Merrill : I brought a tractor in the scene .
Video : The Agan tractor .
Blab ! You know , you know , you know , you know , I 'm going to do it ! You know .
So I school , I would say Siftable and put it closer to interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
and by by making its own history .
Video : I mean ,
DM : It 's a story with the final story , and it can decide him how you 're going to do it .
DM : It 's a story with the final story , and it can decide him how you 're going to do it .
Video : Voly , cat .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool , realized , to walk and execececutting music .
is a tool , realized of that , to walk and execececutting music .
Siftable here , they 're going to get from sound like bass , bass and the bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose to use .
You can also insert these sounds in a sequence to buy your pleasure .
And they 're going to move it to a touch a " and a " sequence . "
These are actually actually that you can control from the live , like the reverbs and the filter .
I attacks it to a particular sound , and then including it .
And then there are the general effects as time and volume , and they 're willing to the whole sequence .
We look at how it works .
Video : DM : We 're going to start putting a base in two Siftable , we 're going to get it into a series , we add it , we add other base .
I put a bottom line .
Video : DM : I 'm going to get some percussion --
Video : And I 'll put the filter of the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the live .
Video : DM : I can quencing the whole sequence to inclinding the whole sequence of time or another .
Video : DM : And I 'm going to say the fairly to the low low to expression .
Video : DM : I can recombine the sequence .
So I don 't have to plan it first , but I can improvising it , make it longer or more hort .
And now , finally , I can slightly , I can fly saying the whole sequencing the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new murder murder to do it more and more like how our brain work .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this lost , and also some possibilities that we try to bring out the lab .
The concept that I want to turn you is that new generation of the projects that we want to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a written .
I 'm writing books , it 's more than that , of course , but it 's more than that ,
It 's also love and the fascinating of my life .
And I don 't expect to be changing .
But , I said , something particular happened in my life and in my life and in my career , which led me to realibrate the entire relationship with this work .
The thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called Manogy , Prega , Ama , " which , diversity , diversity from my previous books , for some reason , and became a great sensational , bestseller .
And the result is that everywhere goes , people treat me as if I were convicted .
Do -- convicted , convicted , convicted .
They 're going to go from me now , and they say , " Don 't have been able to do that ?
Don 't you fear to continue to write the whole life without able to create a book that can important someone to make a book that matter ? "
what do you do ? "
It 's rassure , you know .
But it could go worse , in the part of the 20 years ago , when I started to say , I was a adolescent adolescent -- I wanted to be a written .
I would go to meet the same reaction based on the fear .
And people say , " Don 't themes I didn 't do that ?
Don 't you fear that umiliation of the rejected refy ?
Don 't you achieve this for all life without that nothing that nothing is ever outside and die on a cumulate of free with the foot of floor to free with the foot to core ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah . "
Yeah , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I 've always had afraid .
And I also fear of many other things that people can 't have to have .
As the algae and other things .
But as I thought , as I thought , and I was asked , and I was asked up , because
Is it rational ?
It 's a logical that anybody to expect to be spaper by a work that you feel like to do .
But what 's there that is so particular in the impress to make us nervous to make us nervous health to each other in a way that other people don 't do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember a only in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he fear to be engineer ?
And it was never -- that block of the engineer John , how do it ?
Don 't work that , you know ?
Onests , chemicals like group don 't have certainly , in the several engineers , earlier , driven the reputation of being hand-depressions .
We have a writers , we have enough this reputation , and not only written by creative , we have this reputation of being huge .
And I don 't think about that look at the sad of the death of the magnificent death of the creative creative minds , they die , they die , they die and often for them .
And the people who don 't suicipate is actually being disdied by their dames .
Norman Mailer , before he die , in the last interview said , " Every my book killed a little bit more " . " Every extraordinary affermation work .
But we don 't buy each other , when we feel that we heard these things that we 've heard these things that somehow we completely internal and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are somehow leged and art , at the end , eventually , will produce the ancient .
And the question I want to get to everybody today is : you know , you 're agreement with this idea ?
It 's good about this thing -- because they looked at it from a centimeter , it 's not good for anything about this suppose .
I think it 's hate .
And I don 't want to see it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see it in the next century .
I think it 's better encourage our great creative minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case , in my case -- would be very dangerous to start at the end of the way to the dark , especially dangerous circumstances in my career .
That 's what you 're looking at , I 'm pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I 've got about 40 years .
I have still four work in me .
And it 's very easy that whatever write about it , and then it will be judled by the world as the work that I did after spaper that I did get out of my book .
I 'll be slamming , because we are all about friends here -- is that my biggest success here -- is that my biggest success here --
Oh , Gesus , who think !
You know this is the kind of thought that leads one person to start drinking a person to start drinking nine and I don 't want to do it .
I would say to continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question is , how do it becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflections , that the way to work to continue to write is to create a psychological coule , OK ?
I have to have a security of security between me , which I 'm write , and I 'm writing , and I 'm going to go to see , and as I was trying for all the scorning of how to do this , I started looking through the time , trying to find other societies to see if they could have the best ideas and see if they could have the best ideas and more healther .
as to help creative people to manage creative inerent inerent people of creative creativity .
And that research led to antician to the ancient Grece and ancient Rome .
Sem because it turns out to the circle and then back .
In the ancient Grece and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity was coming from men , OK ?
It was thought that creativity was this beautiful about the divine and sitting in the men someone distant source and unknown .
The grew creativity , they call these spirits of the creativity .
Socrate , wonderfully , he believed that else wisdom to be else .
The Romans were the same idea , but they called that kind of the kind of spirit without a genius .
which is great , because the Romans didn 't really think that a genius were particularly intelligent .
They think a genius was this kind of entities that had been able to be literally lived in the walls of the studio of an artist , a little bit like the elfy Dobby , and that came out to see about the work of the artist and modeling the result of that work .
Except -- here , that 's the distance of which I talk about -- that 's the psychological coule that you protected from the results of your work .
And everybody knew that it was that it worked , right ?
So , the antipeople were protected by certain things , like the narcissism , not ?
If your work was exceptional work , you couldn 't take all the meriting , everyone who was helped by this incorporate genius .
If your failure job , it wasn 't all your color , right ?
They all knew that she was your genius to be a inable .
And so people han concept creativity in West for a long time .
And then Renaisance came and everything , and it 's changed , and born this great idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe , and no longer left to go to the mitize space to the mitic creatures that they write from divinity .
This was the rational of humanity and people started to think that creativity was completely by ishared .
And for the first time in history , I started to referre this or that artist like a kind of like a rather than one person with genius .
And I must tell you , I think it was a big error .
I think allow someone , a simple person to believe that a simple person to be like a recipient as the source , the essence and the source of all mysteries , inconodence and a responsibility responsibility to a lot to the fragile human psychches .
It 's how to ask someone to inguiate the sun .
And it 's a completely ego and it creates all these inexishable expectations on the performance .
And I think it was this pressure to have this pressure advartists in the past 500 years .
And , if that 's true , and I think that 's the question is , and I think that 's the question ?
Can we do it several that ?
Maybe back to a more powerful understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people between the audience who would solve legitimate suspician on the notion of the notion of , you know , you do people who are spraying on the notion of their projects .
I 'm probably not to convince you all about this .
But the question I would like to get is -- why not ?
Why not think that way ?
Because it 's more sense of everything else I 've ever heard to explain the exasperant impreveilability of the creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so , basically , everyone here -- everyone here -- knows , you don 't buy .
And in fact , sometimes it can be completely paranormal .
I did this recently with the extraordinary poetetetesh Ruth Stone , who 's now 90 years , but that 's a poetesse for all life and told me that during his childhood in the Virginia , working out in the window , and she was going to feel , when a poetry .
He said he was like a fragorous air train .
And he was rotled to her from the landscape .
He felt that was , because she was tremely to be able to be the earth .
He knew to have one thing to do about that point and it was , words , " run like a matta . "
And so it was going to go home and sent , he wouldn 't have to make it a piece of paper and a matter of paper , and I 'm going to get it to get it and slaughter it on the page .
Sometimes he couldn 't be fast , so he running and run and run off and then he would go to the home and the poetry her through and she would keep it up through the landscape , and he would keep it up through the landscape , and he would keep it up through the landscape , and he would continue to go back to the landscape .
And then there were those times -- this piece I won 't forget -- there were moments where it was almost losing moments that was almost losing it , OK ?
So , she was running up at home and she was trying to get out of paper and saying it was going through , and he said , he was like to go through , and then he said , he was like to sleep up with the other hand and the step .
He was the poetry from the tail and reput it in his body and transcent on the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect page and intact , from the last word to the first word .
So when I felt that -- I thought , it 's crazy , it 's exactly equal to my creative process .
Not my creative process -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a mule , and my way to work is , and wake up to wake up and go and going and pass us enjoy to work and pass us enjoy .
But even I even in my mind , I 've striked against that thing , sometimes .
And I 'm supposed to be the fact that many of you did it .
You know , even if the work and ideas were saying by a certain source , I can 't really know .
And what is that ?
And how can we relate to it to it , but , how can we do it , but , rather , that make us remains healthy , that make us ?
As I 'm going to , the best example of the contemporary example I have is the Tom Waits , which I interviewed a different journal years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of the life was the incarnation of the artist , trying to control , to manage , to reach these species of impulse creative impulses .
But then I invent , he washed , and one day as she was driving on a drive in Los Angeles , he changed everything for him .
He was going to be fast and all of a sent , and it 's a sent , and it goes into its head as inspiration , elusive and fix , and you want it , you know , it 's wonderful , and it would like , you know , it 's wonderful , but not how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , she didn 't have a match , doesn 't have a record .
So , I start to hear this kind of old anxiety ran in him like , " I 'm going to lose it , and I 'll rebring it from this song .
I 'm not good and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , they stop .
I 'll make the entire mental process and he did something new .
I just look at the sky and said , " Don 't see I 'm driving ? "
" It seems to write a song now ?
If you really want to be back , you know , you can get it to a more opporting time when I can take you .
Otherwise , I go to importance someone else today .
You 're going to disturban Leonard Cohen . "
And his workers worked after that .
I didn 't work , the job was still dark like .
But the process , and the fish that attornied it was required when the genius , the genius , the genius out of him that problems and liberate it remaintain it from , and made it was going to , by remaining it .
but they were wasn this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange thing that was and exterribly not Tom .
So , as I felt that story started to change a little bit the way I worked , and I was saved up .
This idea , I was writing , when I was writing " Manogy , Prega , Ama , " and fall in one of those cave out of the disperation where we all when we 're working on something and we can 't start to think that 's going to be a disaster , which that 's going to be the worst book .
Not just the worst book .
And I started to think about gectacking this project .
But then remember Tom that talked about the air and I told it was about the air and I tried to do it .
So I got up my face in the mantickilled and I realized my common corner to a vacuum corner .
And I said to high voices , " You know , what , we 're both known that if this book isn 't be internally my , no ?
Because as I 'm going to see it all I have , I don 't have that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to present you , and make your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know , you know , I don 't do anything .
I 'm going to writing the same because it 's my work .
And I would like to say that it was recorded that I 'm shown to do my part . " Because , finally it 's so , OK -- several it 's so , OK -- several to the people were sitting in the North people were saying for the midle of the midle of the midle of the sacross the damn ,
And they were always magnificent , because the ballerins were professional and they were great .
But every once , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists become transendent .
And I know that you know what I 'm going to talk about , because I know you all have a certain performance .
It was like the time stopped , and the dance ballery , and the balloon through a kind of a brick and not doing anything different from the usually , like 1,000 night before , but all you stand down .
And suddenly not appeared as a human .
But it turns out from the direction and below the fire in the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , at the time , at the time , people knew what was called it with his name .
They were able to drive the hands and started to canting , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God . "
That 's God , you know .
Curious known -- when Moror the South , the south of Spain , they got this habitude with them and the pronounders in the centuries from " Allah , Allah , Allah , " , " role , " which you can hear in the road or with floor .
In Spain , when an artist has done something impossible and magic , " Allah , role , " Allah , " run , " Buy , " Brituincomprehensive , " Spurching God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But , the problem comes the day after , for the ballerin the dance itself , when you wake up and discover that 's the 11 morning of Martedute of God .
It 's just a mortal with the knees , and maybe never never to be able to hear that allow .
And maybe no one will be the name of God still as it goes , and what to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most pain to make a creative life .
But maybe not have to be so angosat to be so angoscious if you can 't believe , actually , in fact , the most extraordinary aspects of your being from yourself .
But you just believe that they 're going to get a data that is prested by a source of this squisite part of your life that you have to go to someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think it 's all changes .
And I started to think that , and I was certainly like this , and I thought about it for several months in the work of the book I 'm going to public , I 'm afraid , follow-waste , I was going to get it on my great success .
And what I have to continue to say when I feel electried by this is , not afraid .
Don 't go . It 's only done your work .
It 's about your part , whatever can be .
If your work is dance , balance .
If the divine , absurd genius to give up a few kind of wonderful , for one moment through your effort , for one moment through your effort , then , " Ole ! "
Otherwise , you do the same dance .
And " Ole ! " " Ole ! "
I think there , I think it 's going to teach it .
" Ole ! " at yourself , even for the love to have had love and testardaggin that you can make you keep you to introduce you to keep you to introduce you to keep you to keep you to keep you to keep it up .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean and discovery of new genes .
Now we 're starting a new path : we started to digitize biology and now now now from that digital code we 're going to go into a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We 've always tried to get big questions .
" What is life ? " is something that many biologists , I think have tried to figure out .
We tried a different approaches , reducing it to the terms .
We 're digitizing over 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was going to go from the analyzed world of biology to the digital world of computer .
Now we can ask us : we can regenerate life , or create new from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest genitalium genitalium that can autorem into the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create one more smaller .
We can be able to eliminate a hundred genes of the way I 'm here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
Let me , that 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , is very unliving that this can bring to a living cell a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to progrew was synthesize this chromosome to get to modify the components to bring the some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " Can we can synthesize a chromosome ? "
Can chemistry to produce these great molecules that we never had to create before we could never create before ?
And , in case , we can make a cromosome , can we make a cromosome ?
A cromosome is simply a chemist of chemical material .
The speed that we 're able to digitalize life is growing in exponential rhythm .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , procrete rather slowly , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results of it bring it on an exponential curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process required a lot of passages , beginning with a bioetic review before we began to start the first experiments .
But we found that synthesize that DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of cars on the world that producing small segments of DNA , of the length of 30 to 50 letters and it 's a degenerative process , the more errors there are .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and run the errors .
And this was our first attempt , to go from the digital information genome of Phi X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills kills .
We designed the fragments , we did the correction of errors and get a DNA molecules about about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemist , and we put it into the bacteria , and we put it into the bacteria , bacteria have started to read this genetic code and product the viral particles .
The viral particles have been required by the cells , they were back and destroyed the E. coli .
I talked about recently with membranes of the oil industry , which they have certainly understood this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where software can actually build his hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in great .
We wanted to build the whole cromosome of the bacterium .
They 're over 580 miles reading genetic code .
So we thought we 'd build it in a cassettes of the virus , so that we can change the seven to figure out what they 're the components of a living cell .
The design is critical design , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard was a mile for every 10 thousand basis .
We found that original sequency , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence , we never would ever be able to do it .
One of the process is designing over 50 lets that have been overwhelming segments that are all the other segments of 50 letters to build subunits smaller working together .
We try to get the only only one here here .
You 've probably got a bed that we put on the physical philit .
Think of that we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters together code about 20 friends , and there 's a specific order to letters for each amminoacid .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , framework , frageous , and thoughts .
What we did in the beginning was autograph .
Some were deluses from the fact that it wasn 't poetry .
We designed these segments to just just just unfortunate with enzymes .
There are enzymes that reputs them and put them together .
And we started to assemble of the parts , beginning with five to seven thousand reading them to segments of 24 miles reading readers to get to 72 a letters to get to 72 thousand reading to 72 thousand reading .
And we have these sequen-step produced these abundance , so we 're trying to make a very , so we 're trying to create a very robustood -- you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to authomatize the process .
So , this seems the tabellon a basket .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 thousand , over 100 thousand are not going to be directly in EExtending .
It comes to the limit of the modern of the biology tools .
So we looked at other mechanisms .
We knew mechanism called homological recombination , which in biology can use to recombination DNA can unend up segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , can absorb three million radiation .
You can see in the super requarter as its cromosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours is refly reflies exactly like it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely seatch .
They can live under empty .
They 're absolutely certain that life exists in space , and you moving new water environments .
In fact , NASA showed that this happens .
This is an image of the molecules that we built these processes , just using these processes , just using the least design segments .
The clean assemble them .
This was not taken with an electronic microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It 's a great molecules that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that cover a time of about six seconds .
This is the publishing we did a little time ago .
They 're over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the biggest molecules of a structure that we ever created by the man .
It 's a weight molecular weight to 300 million .
If we stamming with a 10 without spaces , you would like 142 pages , they would like 142 pages to turn this genetic code .
Now , how do we do that ? How can we activate it ?
Of course , you loan is a guys play game .
It 's a little more complicated when they use bacteria use .
It 's also simpler when it 's eucarious , you can just extract the nucleus and insert it , which is basically the clonation .
In the bacterium archaea is instead of integrated instead of the cell , but we recently recently , we have recently demonstrated that we are able to do a transplant to another and activity .
We can have a cromosome from a microbial species .
The two are as different as the men from the men .
We have some gene that we have some gene in a more way that can decide to choose for this chromosome .
The men with the enzymes so that they kill all proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was stupendent -- and you open our sophisticatogies -- the new cromosome , the new cromosome of went into the cell .
And we thought we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to spines more in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms .
We found that a lot of species have added a second or a third chromosome of new tracks , in a thousands of new tracts to that species .
So who think evolution as a only gene gene to evolution as one gene , and they don 't understand a lot of biology .
There 's enzymes called " restriction " that advantage of the DNA .
The cromosome that was in the cell .
The cell phone that we put it .
It 's expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as a material , masticated , and we were retled with only the cell and the new cromosome .
and it blue because of the genes we put .
And in a short time , you know , all the characteristics of a species have gone , and we turned out it into a new species , based on the new species that we put in the cell .
All proteins are , and they have changed , and when we read the equivalent of the exactly to what we 've been transferred to what we 've transfer .
Now , this could seem alchemissioned , but we can altering the DNA software . We can change things in the way .
Now , I 've already explained that you don 't talk about genesis -- but we progress from three and a half million years of evolution , and I said that we 're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian explosion that will come to create new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's obvious when we think about our necessities .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right to give you a little example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 , there will be four years , they will be four .
We 're having now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicinal and gas for six billion people .
It will be more tough to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion coal , more than 30 billion oil , more than 30 billion oil baries .
That means a hundred millions of baries a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or whatever kind of process it to reduce them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the all of the CO2 emission from these materials that end up the atmosphere .
At day , because of scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they 're the components for the future .
The electric industry only only only has a dozen about components , and think how many different things came out .
Our limits here are very biological data from the reality of biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have a techniques , because of that we call the synthesization , can create what we call genomics combinatory genomics .
We can build a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million cromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes or to try to get the processes to produce either optimize or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , production chemical or fuel , fuel , chemical vaccine ,
This is an instantaneous of some software programmed that we 're working on to be able to seatch and design species to the computer .
Well , we don 't know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly what they 're the genetic code .
Now we 're concentrating on the fourth of the generation .
You also saw you who are ethanol from the grant , they were a finished experiment .
We have a lot of secondly and third generation that will use enough to sugar that they use enough to be higher value like the optan or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without increase in increase in more impact the cost of food and limitate the availability would transform CO2 in matter , so we 're working on to design cells that can make this project , and we think we can get this retremely think we can have this purpose to do this , and we think we can have the first quaring carbon how we think about 18 months .
The light solar light sunlight is a metodown-odowntown -- but in our discoveries all over the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2500 feet deep in the water temperature of water .
They put in the middle of CO2 using hydrogen molecular source .
We 're trying to figure out if we can incanalong the CO2 , which can easily be transported by the way , convert that CO2 in the fuel , to drive this process .
So , we think we can be able to increase what we can be able to increase what the basic question of what the basic is Nice , and we have the remarkable to reach the whole obic goal to report the entire oil industry .
Exactly . If you don 't do it from TED , where can you ?
It would be a main energy energy .
And we 're working to use the same way to use the same way to use the same way .
You saw this year with influence , we 're always back a year and with a dollar in less when it 's found that they 're going to find the vaccine .
I think that you can change building vaccinable vaccinable vaccinable .
That 's how the future can start to seem changing , the tree of evolution , accelerating the tree , accelerating synthetic evolution with synthetic bacteria .
We 're just so from the best people .
Our purpose is to do a long time to try to do it . Thank you .
First of all I 'll show you , the most quickly possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we took to Microsoft in a followed to a quickly push . This is Seadrhagon . This is Seadrhagon .
It 's a environment that you can interact is local level that remote with a huge amount of data .
We 're seeing here , so we 're seeing a lot of gabyte pictures with a kind of a such a panoramic sponing , disponing the images how we want .
And not matter how big it 's the amount of information that we see , how big these are collection of data or images .
Most of the photographs , but this is a digital scan was scanning from the Bilibrary of Congress , and reenter in the craft of 300 megapixel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexiously architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not .
This is the Dickens of Dickens . Every colonful represents .
To show you that it 's about textbook , and not images , we can do something like that , to actually show you that 's a real representation of the textbook , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little bit of electronic book .
I don 't know it .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of The Guardian .
Every great is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and beautiful experience of a magazine or a neat , or a newspaper , which is for nature multiple a lot of a lot of injured multiple .
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of the Guardian .
We 've created a higher publishing advertising -- much more higher than what you use in a normal published -- and we put you in the extra community .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that that means to put the pop-up to the pop-up and other porcheries , not need to be necessary .
Of course , mapplications is one of the most obvious applications for this type of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if not say that we have contributing to this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , you know , a NASA geospatial image .
So , we 're going to go to something else .
This is now actually from the willing to the web ; you can go see it .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual computer in the very interesting computer in Noah Snavely , a student of Washington of Washington , with Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Seitz of Microsoft Research . It 's a very good collaboration .
And it 's from Seb , gestite by Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of pattern , where we can go from an image to the other and have this kind of experience .
But the space of the images here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization , they have recorded these images , so that correspond to the recorrespond to the Roccivilization in the Montagreed , all of the way on the Grasis on Montagne Roccivic , they 're taken . So , you see elements of a panoramic show , and these things are all the space that 's been space space .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Nohahs -- and this is from a prototype of Photosynth that we did for the first time , the scorsex scorsex -- to show what I think is the key to really get the key of the technology , Photosynth . And it 's not necessarily evident obviously evident that we put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Notre catthedral Dame in Flickr . Bastic Dame in Flickr and you get images in Flickr and you get images in the maglies , other people in the maglights , and saying , you know , the campus , and saying , you know , you know , it 's discovery to this model .
So they 're all picked by Flickr and they were all connected to the space level .
And it 's possible to navigate this way simple .
You know , I never thought I would never have thought I 'm going to end up in Microsoft .
It 's very gratification to get this kind of according here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different types of different kinds of photos : those of the phone to the SLR phones , a meaningful number , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try to look at those strange .
Many of you have been doing it , etc .
Somewhere there is a number of photographs -- here it 's a series of photographs -- here .
This is a poster of Notre Dame recorded right .
We can go from the poster to the vision of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the entire memory of how to appear the Earth , from the visual visual -- and connecting all those data together .
All those pictures become connected , the more than the parts of the parts .
You have a model of the entire emerging model .
Think of this as a Stephen Lawler 's work on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as people use it , and the people who use it , and the advantages for the use .
Their picture are sea with insert metapes by other people .
If someone is the idea of the idea of contracting all these saying the name , my picture of Notre catthedral chthedral to recognizes all of those data , and I can use it as a point of the ingress to dive in that space , in that metaphing the pictures of everyone else , to have a social experience of cross-mode , red experience of cross-mode , red experience of cross-moving cross-moving ,
And of course , a consequence of this are virtual model , extremely elaborated in the earth , collective , and not only by switches and satellitaries , but by the collective memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand what your software will be able to do is that you can see us doing is that in the next years , all the photographs , all the photographs will be basically connected with anyone in the entire world will be basically connected together ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is basically discover .
He 's creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the basis of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of semantical information that 's requires a lot of these images have to be able to .
As when you make a research on the web , you 're digits sentence and the textbook on the web has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what if that pictures connects to all your pictures ?
So the amount of semantic interconnected and the amount of wealth that is really huge . It 's a classic classic classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the major pleass when you travel and one of the ethnographic research is the power of live in the wind , and the wind , the people who have the past in the wind , touching the stone in the wind leaving plants .
And the Basti think that Jaguar travel even beyond the Via , or that the Inuit 's still college , or that in Himalayas , or in Himalayas , the Himalayas , the budget the respapoogy of the Dharma , to remember the idea that the world that the world that we live in not exists in sense , but it 's just a model of all , but it 's just a model of the idea that we live in in the world that we live in the world that we live live in in the respahead ,
the consequence of a particular set of choice that our own inspiring has done , well or a lot of generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
We all do it . We 're all procrew .
We 're going to be in initiation .
We need to deal with the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprise and ballies --
We all have an art .
What hits is the rhythm of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
Not that they 're the Penan Penan 's 's Moneer 's Sahara , or the following Vooodoo Haiti , or the guerriers of the Kenya Sahara , or camerriors , or a cammaughter in the Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a yaa-ring drugs in Qomolanger , in Everest , the dea mother of the world .
All these populations teachers are teaching that there are other ways of thinking , other ways to move in the world .
And if you think , you can reflected a second , it 's a concept that hope you can give you hope .
Insit together , cultures of the world , cultures are creating a spiritual life that we want to have the planet and it 's important for the well-being of the planet as the way the biological well-being of the planet as the biological biosphere .
And you can think about this ragnature as a cultural ethnosphere and you can call the total ethnosphere , inspiring , meant , inspiring , ideas , inspiring , inspiring , intuitions , willing to be from the human behavior of consciousness .
The etnosphere is the patrimony of humanity .
It 's the symble of what we are and what we can be as a species .
And as biosphere was a very much consumed as it happened to ethnosfetime and purches much more rapidly .
Nothing biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent of all species was about the same as the way it 's been on the beyond the extinction of biological diversity -- and not even close to the most optimistic diversity -- and not even close to the most optimistic diversity --
The index of that is , of course , the linguistic lose .
When you 're born , there were 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the midle of the human spirit .
It 's the middle of every culture comes in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a bacin the mind , a spiritual possibility .
And those 6,000 languages , as we 're here sitting in Monterey , at least half of the children .
They don 't get more teached to kids , which means , unless you won 't walk , which are already death .
What 's more sad , the sad than being the last silence , of being the last to talk to a language , not have a way to transmit the wisdom of the promise of the promise of the promise of the children ?
This return out the state of someone in the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks are a deal with the elderly More , the sillables of a ancient language .
And I know someone to say , " Isn 't that ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we 're talking about all the same language ? " Bensimulate , then we talk to yorba .
Let 's talk kogs .
You 'll cover a translate of what it means not to talk to his language .
Today , I 'd like to do you a journey through the label --
a little journey in ethnosphere to give you a tail of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " several ways to really have a different ways of exists .
Let 's take for example this Barasana , in Amazon , the section of anacony , which creating my myth of the snaps , which creating my own field of snaps .
It 's a popular that 's not able to distinguish the blue because it floor it 's identified in the time , which depends the popular .
They have a strange language and a marriage regulators , detecting a different language . " You have to move a different person who talk a different language .
And it 's radical in the past , but the particularity is that in these extremely extremely told that they 're about about to be or seven languages , because of matrimons of them to be a languager .
They 're limited to hear and then start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes I lived , the Waoran Ecuador , the Woran Ecuador , a popular that had the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have tried to a commercial error .
They did discover it from the photographed that they were in a few who were in a few who had adichevolved , forest that this popular popular pluvial forestimate .
They collected the pictures , they turned to the research of a form or a figure out , and not finding anything , they have been dealing with the five missionaried , and they killed the five lots of millions with the mills .
But Waorani don 't only killed the foreign kills .
They killed to kill them .
Fif-4 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We were eight generations and we found two of natural cases , and we found two natural cases , and when we indeed to know , they have a tremendous knowledge that one of them were aging , and then they killed it the same .
The crafts were able to recognize the animal urine , and recognize it .
In the early ' 80s , I was assigned a very interesting task when I was assigned to Harvard , asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to Haiti me to get in the base of the Duvalier , and impossessing me to do the zombic zombies .
To give a sense of miraculous miraculous , I should have to understand the Voodoo culture and that Vodoo culture is not magic .
It 's a pretty much of complex metaphysical vision in the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the great religions in the world , what would you say ?
Christianism , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent comes out of , thinking that the Africa is thinking that Africa sub-Saharan Africa has not religious . And instead of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these very profound tragic concepts that they 're slavery of slavery .
What makes the voodoo is the intense report between life and death .
So , you know , you know , the spirits .
The spirits can be invocated by the Great Aqua , they respond to the dance of dance and replacement , they replacement in the way that for a brief actiming the follow of the following goes .
So , the voodooists say , " You 're going to say , " You 're going to give God .
We say in the temple and diventire we forget God . "
And the moment you 're going to be , is the spirit that you can make you get the bad ?
So you 're going to see these incredible events : followed voodoo in the state of trance that touching infuel .
On all the popular that I lived the most extraordinary people are the Kogi of Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta , in Colombia section .
Extics of the type of civilization that once had on charary plankers of Colombic planets that are in the caraibic massive planets that you erge on the charge massive planution that erge on the charge .
In a mackicked continent , this popular , this popular popular was never conquered by Spanish .
And they 're now by a cler-cler-cler-extraordinary .
The followed people are taken away from the families to three or four years , and they live in a good world , and they live in a good world , and they live in a good world .
Two periods of nine years choices to reproduce the nine months of gestation that spend in the usering of the mother , they 're metaphor in the usering of the Great Mother .
So , that time , they 're acculturated to the values of their society , values that they predict and only their predict and their predict , they 're going to say that they predict .
At the early of this incredible initiation , they 're suddenly led out and for the first time in life , at the age of 18 , they see a high . And in that accounter-a-awareness of the first city , when the sun is the sun of beautiful , everything that they learned in theory . The floating that they learned in theory . The pass the sun is to be conference . The flipping . The pass is going to go to life . The please . It says ,
" Vison ? I 'm told you .
It 's amazing . It 's now to you protect it . "
They 're called the major brothers and they say that we , brothers , we are the colors of destruction of the world .
This level is extremely important .
When we think about ingene populations and the environment we 're invote and the old story of the noble selling , which is a razy concept in its simplicity or maybe invote to the same as well , or maybe invote , and say that these populations are closer to us .
The Ingenius are not feelings or feelings , or indebull .
There 's no space for these things in the paluds of the Asten or in the Tibet , but because of the time and return , they created a mistics of the Earth based on the concept of being known to be aware of that closer , but on an unknowledge that the Earth can live only because it 's infected by the way to be living because it 's consciousness of human consciousness .
What does that mean ?
And that 's a boy of the Ande who grows on the Ande that mountain is a beat . And he will drive her destiny . It will be a different depth of the Mountain , and it 's going to have a different report . And it 's going to be a different report .
which is the dimora of one spirit or a mineral waste is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the report between the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Britannica , creating that forests served that forests served to be cut .
And that 's made me a human being from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that forestimates are the Hukuk 's dimora of Hukuk and the stories of the paradise and the dogs that live in the northern world , spiriting the world , spirits that are dealthm during the Hukukuk .
If you start looking at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of their sensitive discoveries . We take this plant .
I took this picture to open in the nordocted in the nordoccils .
Maybe some of you heard about the ayahuge , the most powerful substance of the sciamanic repertoilet 's the sciamanic repertoilet .
What makes the labor is not the physical potential is not the physical potential of the substance , but his elements . It 's from two two elements .
From a leash side , this leasure legacy that contains a series of charge , harmine , slightly extending .
And I can take the only plant you have a bunlustry that alters a little bit the consciousness , but it 's miscale of the family of the Psychotria family said Psychotria .
This plant is a triptamine , very similar to serotonin the nice , dispthoxyptamine-five , methoxyptamine .
If you never see Yanomami , you 'll see the nose that they do from a different set of species , anched methoxyptamine .
And to be that policy on the nose is a little bit like to be shooting on a fire . And then you can get the waiting of electricity . It doesn 't create a destroke of electricity .
I often I often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who walk the psychedelic was , with his discovery of fungi in Mexico .
I can 't do this thesis , you can 't be able to class these triptamines , because if you 're not telling anybody to be hallucinated . And they can 't tell one of being horly . And they can 't be horly , because they 're money from a physician that 's naturally in the intestine that 's intestine , he 's called the inossize .
It 's possible to absuit , if you 're just just a little bit of the other chemicals that money MAO .
Now it 's the beautiful : MAO , which are in this liana are MAO , the same kind of MAO , the same kind of need to be able to get the triple . The question is in a floating 80,000 species of plants , how these popular popular popular son-like , they 're not that , but if you combine , in this way , create a biochemical version of the parts of the parts ?
We use the great eulifem of the test and the error , which can reveal .
But if we ask the Indian , they 'll tell us , " The plants are talking about it . "
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahumpahumpahumped in the forest , and that the eyes will reach in the same species .
If we ask them how they say they will make their tasonomous tells us , " I thought I 'd do not know about plants , the rest of the plants , you don 't know . "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night of a while , and each other , it will be a different .
With this doesn 't have a laurea at Harvard , but it 's much more interesting to count stami .
Now , [ you know , ] the problem is that even those of us who have heart people who have in the ingenes are pitting them in the pitter , but somehow to get the margins of history to our real world , and pass .
In fact , the 21st century , between 300 years , it will not remembered for the wars or innovations , but rather like the era that we were stopped and abbracing activity of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All cultures through the several have been involved in a dance for new life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indian Sioux didn 't stop being Sioux when they put out of the argue and further like American have no stopped to be American when they put from the horse and calved .
It 's not the change or technology that 's the technology that minattempt . It 's the power . It 's the power .
The during the domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you 'll find that these are not cultures are not disappear to disappear .
They 're living and dynamics and dynamics out of identifiable existence that go beyond their ability .
And that 's disboscening in the Patria of the Penan ,
a populpulpulpull no-making Sarak , in South Asian popular popular that lived on the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to the servitute and prostitution on the reverse redressed , where you can see the rive fied by lightforest that looks at the Meridional Cinese Meriday , where navailing countries to Merian Cinese Merian , where navailable to the horest ,
takes up to empires the stocks with the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that have come with the discovery of the gold .
If we move on the Tibet mountains of the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard of political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physical extinction of a popular , is convicted to the universal level , but the ethnocide , destruction of a popular lifetime , it 's not only convicted , but it 's not convicted , but it 's a celebrate in certain environments , because it 's part of the development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet of the Tibet until you 're going to get the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in Western China in the Western Tibet , coming to Lhasa with a young connecting young connecting what we 're hearing about . I realized what we 're hearing about .
6,000 sacred monuments in polymumers .
1.2 million people killed by the military Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical to Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to the time of the Chinese Inasion .
Her is the worst of Santity in Santity , during the diaspora that led the popular in Nepal .
Her mother was impresoned and his color was getting rich .
It was brought to hidden in the age of two years , hidden under his guns because she couldn 't live without him .
The sister , who did the same , was put in reeducation .
One day he welled a day running a day run fashion Mao and , for this transgression , was put in seven years .
The pain of the Tibet can be insopurable , but the rein the reinside of the popular is holding .
And then , it 's all reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the world monocromatical world or we want to acked the world policy-diversity ?
The great anthropologist Marget Mead , before he die said that , in our go to this love of the world , we 're going to see the whole globe of the world of human imagination , we 'll not just see the whole guneer of human imagination , but one day we 're going to wake up from a sleeping sleeping , we 'll get from a sleeping to forget to the way that there were others .
And it 's umiliating our species has been for 600,000 years .
The Neolitical Rivolution , who gave us the agriculture , which made us absolutely suck the poetry of the seed of the clerarchy of the slerarchy of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
Smodern world , the modern world has 300 years .
That shark story not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenge that we 're going to deal with the millennia to come .
When these miric myriad of the world is asked what we 're going to say to be human , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
And that 's in these answers that we all risky the possibility of being what we are : a consciously realize that all popular people and all the giardens can figure out .
I took this picture on the northrow of the island of Baffin , when I went to the hunting of the Balin the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , he told me the wonderful story of her grandfather .
The government was not always always always gentleman with the Inuit and in the 1950s to stay our premise , we rink them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , I was told for his life , and took him away all the arms , and all his attices .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't teach the cold , they exploit .
The pats of the slexes were made of charging fish in the skin .
The grandfather of this man didn 't intimise from the libraries or the libraries .
It 's source gattacked off , it 's hot the pantalyss in the skin and defected in your hand . When the floor the floor . When the floor you worked it .
It 's sprined on the pointing of this cut , and when I solid , she killed a dog .
He wasn 't the dog and created a brid , with the cash , he 's put a slethrown , he imbrilliant another dog , and it 's disappeared on the banker , I killed to the banker .
We want to talk about it to cavarsely with nothing ?
In the 1999 , the canadly , the canader reached the total control of a bigger territory area of the bigger California and Texas to them together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's an independent territory . They constraining all the minerary resources .
One splenvironment of how a nationship nationship can recognize with his popular .
And , finally , I think it 's pretty obvious about at least who of us was in these remote zones of the planet , to make it not be remote .
For someone is home .
They represent sections of the human imagination that they go to the high of these kids , like the dreams of these kids , like the dreams of these kids , like the dreams of hope .
For finish , we 're going to be in National Geographic we are not getting to get it .
We believe that polemiics --
[ Applausi ] doesn 't be persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month revenue 35 million visits .
156 countries transmit our television .
Our laughs from millions of people .
Our work is travel to bring our audience in the place of wonderful cultural sorts of cultural anthropology , and hopefully , bural , they will be braced for the reveation of the anthropologize , the world 's going to be in the diversity , and we have to find a lifestyle of life in a pluralister and multicultural world .
where the wisdom of all popular to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I written in this book that I hope you 've already heard and try to evidence some of connections , in case not them .
I would like to start with what I call " the " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " the dogma " official dogma . "
The dogma official thing ?
The dogma official dogesture of all industrial societies . The dogma official dogma : " If we want to want to massive wealth the citizen . " The way to do it is massive individual freedom . "
The reason is , from a side , in the fact that freedom is in itself a value , is , useful , useful , essential , essential , which is essential for humans .
On the other is that if we 're free , each of us can act for all that massive to do everything that massive , we can do everything that massive out of our willing .
The way to massive freedom is massive to be choice .
More people have , more choices , the more are free , and more is their liberty , the greater is their well-being .
This , I think , it 's so deeply radical in society that nobody would drew to doubt .
And it 's also deeply radical in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly great .
I lost a simple note on condition .
In my supermarket there are 175 condition , without content 10 oil variety of oil and 12 acetes and 12 acetages that can buy for you can buy the number of constantly constantly in the field circumstance that no 175 is ready ready ready ready to be your degree .
That 's what supermarket .
And then you go to the electric store to buy a stereo : CD , lector , radio , the CD , radio , radio , prints .
And in this single electric negotie , there 's a great number of components .
We can be able to do six million different combination using the components that there are only in one of the store .
You have to admit that there 's a lot of choice .
Othreats : the world of communications .
And when I was a child , they could get all the phone services , you could get all the phone services that were provided by mom Bell .
It was doing this telephone , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , between the other , was that the telephone never break .
These days went .
Now we have a variety of phones , especially in the phone .
Here 's the cell phone of the future .
My favorite is the middle , MP3 , cut it cut out of the birthic , and they give it for the crykey .
If you don 't see it yet in the store under the home , you 're going to take it .
And what happens is that people enters into the store and ask this question . And you know , you know , what is the answer ? The answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the acquired philosion of choice .
Assister healthcare : no longer happens in the United States that you can go from doctor and the doctor , the doctor say what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and the doctor says , " Okay , we can do A , or B , or B , " As has these benefits and these sauce " B : What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Dr. " What would I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , and B , B has these benefits and these risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you can rebad if she was me , what would do ? "
And the doctor , " But I 'm not her . "
The result we call it " autonomy of the malate , expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But it 's not that a move the weight and the responsibility of taking someone who knows the doctor , to someone else knows -- and almost certainly maled -- and then not in the ideal condition to make that the patient to take the patient decisions to take the patient decisions .
There 's a huge marketing products , direct people like me and you , and that if you think about it doesn 't have any sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why they 're public ?
The answer is that they want to do it .
Something that 's fundamental as our identity is a question of choice , how you see in this vig , " We don 't want to force the kids . They will ceat their sex . " We don 't want to make a identity . " We don 't have a identity . " We have to invent it .
And we can reinvent that sometimes us .
which means that every morning , at the morning , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
I respect to the family and marriage , a time , a time , communal perspective , almost for anyone , he was that she was marriage to do the most possible , and she started to make the most soon possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not not when , and what to do after .
And it 's really to play it .
I teach very smart students , and I do 20 percent in less than I work .
And not because they 're not because they 're less diligent , because they 're not because they 're less diligent .
but why I 'm involved , you know , I 'm going to ask , " Would I do this now ? "
" Would I have to think about before ? I have to think about the kids or the career ? "
I 'm interrogoranants .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this implies don 't completely get the tasks and not get a great vote to my examples .
And they really have to do it . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl , because the technology allows us to work every minute , every day , every single day , from each angle , from the Hotel Randoll .
And in parently , there 's a corner , and I won 't tell you , where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work on the work ? It 's continually decide , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing , with the mobile phone in a tax , the Blackberry in the other , and the noteteteaching .
And even though they 're all spent , every minute that we see our child , we 're also asking the game , we 're also asking this one called ? "
" I have to say to this email ? I have to habits ? "
And also , when the answer is no , that 's not , that 's all this makes the experience of your child , very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , as we look at , little things , big things , big , and large things , the life is a question of choice .
The world was this : On , there were some possibilities , but not all that was a question of choice .
The world today is the world to do this : The dilemma is , " Is it a good thing , or negative ? "
The answer is , the answer is .
We all sorts of the slightly , so I 'm going to talk about the negative ones .
And all this choice competition two negative effects two negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxes is , it produces instead of liberation .
With the options of which choose choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I 'm offering you a meaning : a conduct on the plan of volunteer .
A colleague has access to the data of Vancies , the gigantic societies of funding funding , with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that come to more , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 funds , there 's 10 percent in less than adeside when they 're available to do that they 're only five percent ?
Because with 50 funds that choose choose , is sick . It 's hard to decide , and the choice is remaining .
And I 'm asking , and I still ask , questions , tomorrow , and of course , questions never get .
You know that doesn 't mean only that these workers are going to send food for canoes because they don 't have enough money , it also means that the decision is so ostics that they 're lose the funds of the work .
Don 't participating , they 're losing to five dollars in the work of work , which would be well reverse .
So , the paralysis a consequence of having too much .
And I think it makes the world .
" And finish , for eternity : ketchup , senaps or maionese ? "
You want to take the right decision , if it 's for the right , is it ?
You don 't want to choose the background , and or or not want the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can actually evituate the paralysis , and we 're not going to end up with a choice , we 're not going to be with less options .
And that 's for several reasons .
One of these is that with a lot of condments between them , and it 's not perfect , and it 's not perfect , it 's not perfect , it 's just a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative can imagine us . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us industry , and the requires that it takes the recovery that the decision ,
And even when it was a very good decision .
More are , you know , the easier is easy to be any detailing that 's insatisfic option .
And there is what economists call constantly opportunity .
Dan Gilbert asked a very well about how the value we do things with things that we are in the value that we comparison .
In the rest , when there are lots of options , it 's easy to represent the characteristics of the option of the option that 's choice .
Here 's an example . I shaped to all the people who are not New York .
But that 's what you probably think .
There 's this couple to the Hamptons .
A place of lurse .
It 's beautiful . It 's all about it . It 's all for them .
Nothing . But what he thinks is , but what he thinks it 's , it 's August . "
" Everybody my neighbors to Manhattan is off . "
" I could talk to it right in front of home . "
And it spend two weeks , from the idea that 's losing -- the chance of parking -- the possibility of parking .
The constood is decreases the satisfting for what we have , even when choice was an excellent .
And the more are the options we have to consider , the more the characteristics are going to be returned against as expensive opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things about this .
It talks about living the moment , and maybe living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you 're choose , you 're going to do not do the other .
The things that we don 't choose are attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : it 's growing expectations .
I tried it on my skin beating a new pair of jeans .
I 'm going to almost always jeans .
And we had a lot of one guy , they bought them and wasn them to buy them and wasn 't dissize , just after they took them a life and worked on a lot of times , they started to go well .
So , I went to buy a new when the old those old old one were , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my table . "
The commit said , " He wants to slim , he wants to be putting up ? "
And he wants to them with the cernight-buttons ? " " " Auhed " slamp " ? "
" Do you want them strapted ? "
" Soth them wants to large them or straw ? Blah blah blah .
I was slaughter , and after a while I was able to say , " I want the guy that was the only like , " I was the only like , " I was , so , for a time I tried to all the malites , I went out of the jeans , I got out of the jeans , I 'd ever had .
It was the massive . I had all that choice had the best one .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to figure that .
The reason I was worse with all that choice is that with all that choice , the myself , jeans had to be perfect .
I had expectations , I had waiting for me . I didn 't expect anything exceptionally when there was only a kind of a kind of must be perfect .
What I had bought was good , but I didn 't perfect .
And after I was compared that choose with what I was trying to do , I was insatisfied in comparison .
The addition of the people in life does not make people that increasingly expectations that these are responding to the options of the same .
And that will produce less soddisatives , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing it .
Because if they know , you would not know what I 'm talking about .
The truth more like this .
" It was better when she was worse . " The reason he was better when she was worse , she was that when she was worse when she was worse , you can meet to meet .
And the world , in the world that we live in -- opulents , industrialized citizens with the expectancy of the expectancy of the expectations .
You never surprised to be surprised because your expectations , you 're ingiant , you 're ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here is , " Basse " expectations " Yeah , you want . "
I mean , a little car moment mofe -- which I 'm really married and my wife is really amazing .
I won 't have to do better , I didn 't have to do better ,
But that 's not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of the comparing a couple of jeans is that when you 're only that you 're not when you 're just like that , you 're not satisfacts , and you ask you , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " " The answer is clearly .
The world is responsible . What can I do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a lot of them , and you get a insatisfied , and you ask you who is responsible , you know , you 're going to ask you .
You should have done better .
With hundreds of available variety , there are no successful .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is the result is worth , they feel that they 're going to give the hit to them same .
And in the last few years , the depression is explose in the industrialized world .
I think a meaning factor -- not the only , but important -- that , the important -- that wave is the people have experiences because the standards are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that color is they think that color is them .
So the end result is that we 're in general , we 're better , but we feel worse .
Let me remind you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than having it 's better not at all but by this doesn 't have a lot of choice is better .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm sure we 've been overwhelming the level where the level choices are better our life .
Now , from the politician point of view -- I 've been almost finishing -- from political point , the nocity is the following .
What it allows all this choice in the industrial societies is the material .
There are many places in the world , and you know about it a lot of people in the world , where the problem is not they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too a little bit too .
So the face I 'm talking about is a mal-exclusive to is a modern exclusive of modern , recognize societies .
And what it does does to be able to get is this : Steve Levitt talked about how much those expensive and discover discovered about how those expensive and discover . It 's a spreef money .
I mean that these choicate choicate and dispendious , it 's not just inuutile .
I 'm going to say of a deleter .
They 're going to be worse .
If a little bit of what in our societies allows that were of-scale in those people where people have too a lot of possibility , it would not only be the life to improve , it would be able to improve , but also our life .
This is what economists call a paretian improvement .
A redirection of the record is doing well at all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice , in fact that we go back .
And to conclude , you can become everything that you want , "
You know , people of culture , you think , what does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that can 't make anything in a glass . "
" A castrated , a limited vision of the world --
and that 's what I interpreted this , at the beginning .
But then , I realized , instead , I realized that fish the length .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you eat the bock , so that " all you can 't get the freedom . You get it . You get the paralysis .
If you break the bock in a way that all diminuliitous to decreasuitous satisfy .
You get the paralysis , and you can reduce it .
They all need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too , maybe even for the fish , and even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some symbolics sphere is a recipe for infections and , them , for rovine .
Thank you very much heart .
