I showed this year I showed these slides to demonstrate that the glacial calots , which for almost three million years had the size of 48 States continental , it 's reped 40 percent .
But in the way , this subjects the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice .
The artics is , in a way , the artics of the global climate system .
You can expand it it revers .
The next slide is going to be a very quickly carlay on the last 25 years .
The ice perennia are signed in red red .
You see , you see , they 're going to the blue .
That is the ice in winter , which is the invernice .
You can see that the ice ice ice ice , it 's five years or more , it 's like five years or more , is like the blood , that 's like the blood , that 's where you can see that the body .
In 25 years , it was spent by so ,
This is a problem because the warming of the whole ground , the ice ice ice ice around the ocean , where there are huge amount of coal that , skies , the leaving microbes , they 're transformed in metane microbes .
I spect the totality of the atmoshigh warming , that amount could doubly double , that amount of global wards , that amount of global wasn 't run .
In some deep in some deep lay in Alaska , the metane is already bolding on water .
The professority Katey Walter of Alaska of Alaska team , and I got a team with a team , and I got the winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow ! It 's good . The question is if we 're going to be .
A reason is that this thermal exchange surround of Greenland from the northern .
This is a glacial river .
The brought her never had to get similar .
This is the Kangerlusaq , in the West Southwest of Greenland .
If you want to know how you 're the level of the sea level of ice on the sea , here is where , where it 's where you get to the sea .
These corrings are increasing rapidly .
On the other side of the planet : Antarcticks , the biggest block of the planet .
The last month , the scientists have been tuned that the balance of ice is in negative , and that Antarctica , which is particularly rapid , which is particularly rapid , and it 's particularly rapid .
Equital to six feet of the acque level of the active , like Greenland .
On Himalaya , the third biggest block of ice , they see the laghi , which few years ago were driler .
40 percent of the world population will be half of the world 's powerful water from the slide .
Suller Ande : this glacier is the source of the tailable water of this city .
The brought it is increased .
But when you decrease , the same happens to the water .
In California the snow on the Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The identy is in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , are graves .
The growing secus in the world leads to an involved in the injection of the incendes .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rate out of the normal and without precedented .
Four times more numerous in the last 30 years than 75 years ,
This is a whole sustainable thing .
If you look at it in the historical consequences .
In the last five years , we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 25 million tons of tons in the oceans every day .
Look attentially the Pacific area , the American area , to the American , to the west , and on both the west , and both the parts of the subcontinent , where there is a radical imor of oxygen in oceans .
The major causes of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil fuel .
The oil is a problem , and coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions , together with China .
And he was proposed to build a lot of other coal carbon .
But we 're seeing a change of direction .
These are announcy projects in the last few years and some proposes of alternative .
Everything is a politics in our country .
The coal industries and oil industry have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting coal , which is a listen to the coal .
And that image , I would remember something --
Natal , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion liters of coal gathering .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second largest flow of scories in America .
It happened to the Natal .
The nature of one of the coal industry was this .
Video : The Can : Colonake is a plegro and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and make our economy .
Frosty the carbon is and more and more published .
It 's a good price , adorable and workers are maintain the stay .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The largest minerary society is Massey Coal . This is his amministrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'm going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Peloge , Harry Really -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alliance for the Protecton Clima has launched two campaign .
This is a part of them , one part .
Video : Ate : All COLergy see the climate change as a serious threat to our business .
So , our priority is to invest a big amount of money in a effort of public and confused the true on carbon .
In fact , coal is not spored .
We think it 's clear -- it 's also a good provide .
So not preodd climate change .
Let me do you .
Video : Carbone , you know , you 've heard about it .
So let 's let 's take a turn into an absolutely advocatus for how much coal .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noious , but this is the sound of the coal technology .
The coal is between the major causes of global warming , but the remarkable technology , but the path of coal , you see change everything .
You look at a look . This is the hodive technology .
Al Gore : Indeed , the positive alternative connects to economic question and at that of national security .
Video : Comvice : The economy , the national security , the national security , the climate crisis .
The field that the connects : our dependence on the fossil fuel and oil , like coal and oil .
Now , but , there is a new , cars solution for used to use .
Repower America : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work , make sure , make sure , and help us stop global warming .
It 's inally , a solution that you 're going to solve our problems .
Repower America . You get more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Comvice : It 's about re-giving energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to bring dependence on the dependence on combustible that they kill our planet .
It 's what the future is here . The future is here . Soles , the future of the world 's energy .
It takes a few of people in bad work for brought to brought work .
Compractice : Repower America . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old African old African says , " If you want to fast , you go down to the wooods .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I did an introduction in LHC .
And I promise to figure out how the machine works .
So here I 'm here . And for the other time , there were no LHC , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever -- 27 miles of circumference .
His task is to remember the conditions that were present less than a billion second , from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
And all of that is just environment .
This is the machine under Ginever .
We have photography Bang in the record of the relationships .
This is what work that 's called ATLATLATLAS -- it 's large 44 feet and has a diameter of 22 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building , so you can see the proportions .
Ten September , we have access to the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was immense to immense in control .
It 's a picture of the first of particles that had done all the turn of the LHC , both , and in collision , of course , with a part of the LHC , and spreading particles inside .
In other words , when we saw that image 10 , the 10 September , we figure out that the machine worked , which is a big victory .
I don 't know if that was this to do exultent us , when somebody went to Google and saw that the beginning was this .
That means that we have had a cultural impact beyond that scientific impact .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , and I had to these dored dored here -- these dored dorators .
These files are taking 13,000 amps when the machine works at the maximately of power .
Now , the technicians between you will look at the children and say , " It 's not true . They 're too hard . They 're too hard . "
And they can do that because when they 're very cold slies become the superconditions .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a worders of the space between the stars , these flows can bring that corrupt .
In one of the guntures in the LHC magnetic , there was a fabrication of fabrication .
So the bottom of them down slightly , and the 13,000 press suddenly , they were met a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think these magnets more than 20 tons , and that have moved over 20 tons , and that they moved about 30 centimeters .
They 're just giving about 50 magnetets .
We had to take them , what we had to do .
We repristined them and figure out .
Now , they 're all sorts of them up to their place .
I mean , the brand the LHC will be again integry .
We 're going to accening , and we expect to get a data of jumped data to right or light , and continue so our adventure to find what the morning for the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents reaching the debate on the value of science and engineering . It 's easy to confuture .
I think that 's so hard to go beyond the way to go beyond the limits , I think it 's value of things like the LHC .
I want to conclude with the words of a Ingent scientist , Humphrey Davy Davy , which , imagine , defense of the experiments of his puple , he was pleasure of the injumphredent of the human mind , as the result of human mind as the realize that the ideas of are definitions , that aren 't in nature , that our tripes are , that our triulies , and that aren 't going to be completes , and that our monkey , and that the words of the words of the world , and the world , and the words of the words of the words of the world , and the world , and the world , and the world , and the ideas of the words of the words of the words of the ideas of the ideas of the ideas of the words of the words of the words of the wor
Thank you .
I want to start to wonder about when you think about children , from children , play with the morning .
And as you realize them and herrate them , and you 're going to get them and moving , and learn to think of problems and solving problems and manipulating relationships .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , from information information being inspired by the uses of our physical objects , and my consultant , and my consultant Patts , and the collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking to wonder , " And if we use a computer , instead of having a little polar wild , which is moving on a desktop of the digital polar ar , which is moving the information with the manes of the leaving of the way ,
and you 're like our plentiment ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the answer , building the Siftable .
In a words , a Siftable , a Siftable computer interactive as a cookies .
In a words , a Siftable , a Siftable computer interactive as a cookies .
You can move them with your hand , they can see them , they can see , they 're like , you know , you feel the movement and have a radio and a radio and a radio radio .
But most of course , I 'm physical objects , like the moronces , you can just move it to further .
Siftable : Siften an ecosystem of tool to manipulate the digital information .
And as they get more physical , conscious , the movement , of others , and as they become more physical , conscious , of the movement , of the other , of how we move , we can explore new and different interaction .
I 'll start with a few example .
This Siftare is configurated to show the video : if it 's in a direction , the video rator , the video rator , it 's going to run back .
These interacts are aware of the other people .
If I do do do that , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they are surrounded , they can be act a little bit .
If they are surrounded , they can be act a little bit .
They have their movement and inclination .
We realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use common data , for example , to put a color like a color like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , we have three Siften , and I can use them to color in the middle , where they mischieve .
and I can use them to color in the middle , where they 're misking .
If we 're too much , we can put a little bit to place .
There are also beautiful possibility of learning , like languages , the math and games where people can provide the amazing and see the results of the existence , and see the immediately .
Now , I 'm --
This is a Fibonacci I do with a equations program .
Here we have a words of words that is half between Scarabean and Boggle .
Basically , at every turn a letter to be a letter on every Siftable , Pratically , at every turn to the letter on every Siftable , and while certainly circles , and while certain he 's control him on a diptionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , they remised , and you have a new set of letters and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here 's a children came up with the Media Lab , I did it , so that they were tried to them and I 've been showing them .
They were very much .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don 't have to have to people many education .
You 've only got to say , " That can of the words , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's how other people who are trying to .
This is our younger header , on the right there .
And actually , it was just taking them .
They were only bring morning , for him .
Now , this is an application of an interactive card .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning languages .
It can insert new characters in the scene , they 're just lifts of the Siften , they 're associated with .
It can insert new characters in the scene , they 're just lifts of the Siften , they 're associated with .
So , it 's doing the sunlight .
Video : The sunlight is source .
David Merrill : Now he brought a track in the scene .
Video : The treator : treator .
God ! Yes ! Yes !
So I school , I school , and I hit up and bring them close can interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
And by making your story .
Video : Hao !
DM : It 's a story with open open , and it can decide him how it is .
DM : It 's a story with open open , and it can decide him how it is .
Video : Golas , cat .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool , realized , to willing and execectal music , to wild and exececture .
It 's a tool , realized , to willing and execting music .
Siftable here are such as base , bass and bass and the bacteria .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also inside these sounds in a sequence to you 're doing a bunch of pleasure .
And they just modify it just doing touch a sound and a sequence .
These are actually that you can control from the way , like reverbs reverbs and the filter .
I mean , you know , you know , and then including it .
And then there are the general effects as time and fly , and you 're applying the whole sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : DM : We 're going to put a base in two Siftable Siftable , " we 're going to get them , add other base .
Now , I put a line of bottom .
Video : Do : Do : I 'll add some percussion --
Video : And now I 'll put the filter the battery to the bacteria , so I can control the effect of the alive .
Video : DM : I can fly the whole sequence the whole sequence by one side or the other .
Video : DM : And now I 'll add the filter to the low low low low low down to the filter more expression .
Video : DM : I can recombine the sequence " to fly . "
So I don 't have to planning it first , but I can improvivivisual it longer or more shorer .
And now , finally , I can spent the whole sequence to the left the Siftable to the left the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new multiple machine and more like how our brain works and more like our body works .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this patterns , and also a few possibilities that we 're trying to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmit is that 's coming up to the new generation of projects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk with all of you .
I 'm a writing .
I think books is my profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and my lives of my life .
And I don 't expect that could change .
But , I said this , something particular happened recently in my life and my career , who brought me the whole realibrate with this job .
The particular thing is that I recently wrote this book , this biography called Manogy , Prega , Ama , " which , diversity from my precedented books , for some reason that I used to get out in the world and became a big sensational , bestseller .
And the result is that everywhere to go , people who are treating me as if I were convicted .
It 's true -- convicted , convicted ,
They 're engineer to me and say , " You don 't have fear of fear that you haven 't going to be able to do ?
You don 't fear to continue to write for all life without able to writing for all life without being able to create a book that can important to somebody ? "
what do you do ? "
It 's remote , you know .
But it could go worse , to the more than 20 years ago , when I started to say , I was a teenager -- I was a adolescent adolescent -- I was a writer .
I would go to the same reaction , the same reaction .
And people said , " Don 't temes that I didn 't have success to success ?
Don 't you fear that the humiliation of the rejection ?
You don 't afraid to do this for all life without the life without that nothing is that it 's ever outside and dead on a couple of dinfrants with the boouth of failure of failure ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes .
Yes , I fear of all those things .
I always had fear .
And I also afraid of many other things that people could not have to wind .
As the algaines and other frightening things .
But , how about that I thought , and I was wondering , and I was wondering why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's a logical that anyone who has to expected to be spent by a job that they feeling to do .
But what 's there so particularly in the creative creative , and we make nervous health of the health of other people do not do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember a only time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he fear to be engineer ?
It never was -- that block of the engineer John , how do it ?
Don 't work like this , you know ?
Onests , chemicals like group have no certainly , in the secoli , the reputation of being alcolized maniaces .
We writers , we have enough this reputation , and not just writers , but creative of all kinds of being huge , we have this reputation of being huge mentally instable .
And it 's not more than looking at the sad of the dead magnificent creative magnificent that , only in the 21st century , they died young and often for them .
And the ones that don 't have suicides look at the time .
Norman Mailer , before he die , the last interview said , " Every my book killed me a little bit more " . Each my book killed me a little bit more " . " A extraordinary affermation about the work of life .
But we don 't buy the cyoung , when we feel that we 've heard these things that we 've been completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering is somehow leged and suffering is somehow leged and art , at the end , will last , and will last , and then , will last , and then , it will last , and then , it will will be hard .
And the question I want to bring all of here today is : you 're agreement with this idea ?
It 's good to be -- because he 's looking at a himeter from a distance to me not good for anything this suppose .
I think it 's hate .
And I think it 's even dangerous and I don 't want to see perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encourage our big creative minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start at the end of the dark , especially indeed with the circumstances .
And that 's really -- you look at , I 'm pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I 've got about 40 years .
I have still about four decades work in me .
And it 's very likely that anything writing to write about now , and it 's going to be jobs that I would do the last spent books .
I 'm going to be slavery , because we 're all more or less friends here -- is likely to my hoods .
Oh , Gesus , who think !
You know this is the gender of thinking that leads one person to start to run down the nine of the nine and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep going to continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question is , how to be ?
And so it looks , after many reflections , that the way to work to continue to write on the way to write is to create a psychological costrake , OK ?
I have to find a security of security between me , which I 'm writing , and the natural anxiety on which reaction is that they can get . And , as I was trying to all the time , looking across the year , trying to find other society to see if they could have the best ideas and more healthy . And as I 'm going to see if they could have the best ideas and more healthier .
about how to help creative people to manage inerent inerves the emotions of creativity .
And that research took me to ancient Great and ancient Rome .
I 'm going to go back to circle and then back .
In ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity was giving that creativity was from men , OK ?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit is about they 're dealing and sent to be that they were in the men by a few source and unknown , and unknown .
The greeeeignership called the creativity of creativity " demons . "
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a demon that elarye wisdom .
Romanify was the same idea , but they called that spirit of spirit without a genius .
That 's great , because the Romanii , because the Romanious was somebody who were very smart .
They think they were that a genius was this kind of exciting that created was literally lived in the walls of an artist , a little bit like the elpho Dobby , and that sell out of treatment and the outside of that work and articking the outside of that work .
Except -- here is the distance of which I talk about -- that 's the psychological that you protect you from the results of your work .
And everybody knew that it was so that worked , right ?
So , the anti-protected artists were protected by certain things , like the narcise , no ?
If your work was exciting work was not to take all the goodd , all the way , they all knew that were helped by this genius .
If your failed job , it wasn 't all your own , right ?
And they all knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people han concept creativity in West for a long time .
And then Renascivement came and everything changed , and he was born this big idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe , and no longer leaving space into the misters that write with devices that writing from divinity .
This was the major of humanity and people started thinking about creativity was completely by the ify of humanity .
And for the first time in history , I started to referiring to this or that artist as a rather than one person with the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big error .
I think that allow somebody , one simple person to believe that it 's like a recipient like the source , the source and the source of all the divines , inosis a too big file responsibility to the humans .
It 's like to ask somebody to inguishing the sunlight .
Deform and destores completely the ego and creates all these inestable ints of these initiative indeed .
And I think it was this pressure that was destroyed the artists in the past 500 years .
And if that is true , and if that 's true , the question is , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understander of humans and creative mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't switch 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And probably there is people between the audience that would be reading the scientific subspects on the notion of , insometimes , you do that follow people to spend up with their projects .
I 'm probably not to convince you all about this .
But the question I 'd like to bring is -- why not ?
Why not thinking about this way ?
Because it 's more sense of everything that I 've ever heard to explain the exasperformance of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who I 've ever taken to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- it doesn 't understand , it doesn 't buy rationally .
And in fact , it can sometimes it sometimes seem to be completely paranormal .
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poetesse Rutral Stone , who has now 90 years , but it was a poetesh for the lives and told me that during his childhood in the rural Virginia , and he felt it , inside , and he felt it , in the poem .
He said , he was like a fragorous air train .
And that was rotating to her from the landscape .
He was hearing , because he was doing it , because he was so much a little bit of his feet .
He knew to have one thing to do at that point and it was , " it was , " it 's a math . "
And so it 's back home and sent , he wasn 't going to get to this poem , and he wouldn 't have to get a piece of paper and a wake , and he wake it and sought it on the page .
Sometimes he couldn 't be fast fast , and it would run and running and smoking and wind his poem and poem his poem through and he would continue to rotolar and he would continue to rotolating through the landscape , and he said , " another poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece of the piece , I will never forget it -- there were moments where it was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running house and was trying to paper and paper , and he was going through , and he was saying , and he was going to slow down , and then he said , who was going to slow down with the other hand and coffering .
He was sitting the poem of the tail and swriting it on his body and truly writing it on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page and it 's called , but on the last word at the first word .
So , when I felt it -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly equal to my creative process .
I don 't all the creative process -- I 'm not a condition !
I 'm a mulo , and my way to work is , and wake up to wake up to the same orary every day and saying , and go above and pass , and pass it cool .
But even I , in my head , I handed against that thing , at times .
And I think that many of you did that have been doing .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source of a certain source I could not honestly .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it to it so that we don 't do the head , but , rather , how do we do you get healthy ?
As I think , the best example of the best contemporary example I have is the Tom Waits , which I interviewed a different years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of the life has been recontemporary contemporary , trying to control , gesting , and managing , dominate these species of creative creative inhyzed inspiring these species of creative inhorized inspiring .
But then I invest , he got up , and a day as he was driving on a driving car in Los Angeles , he changed everything for him .
It was going to fast fast and all of a tract tract this little broader , which is a little broader , which is saying inspiration , elusive and challenge , and the wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and the desidation , but not how to take it .
It doesn 't have a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a matine recording .
So , he starts to hear this kind of old anxiety to have a kind of lose , and I 'm going to lose it , and I 'll be obsessed by this song lost , and I 'll start to hear this song .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to the panic , they stop .
I 'm going to do the whole process and made something completely new .
I just look at the sky and said , " Scuses , you don 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" You know , " Would you like to write a song now ?
If you really want to existing , back to a more open when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you go to important something else today .
You 're disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process to work after this .
I don 't work , the work was still knowing like .
But the process , and the fish that was attornized when he took the genius , the genius , the genius that was cause to be flew back to where they were , and he remained it back to where they were , and he made that he wasn 't been able and swake .
but it wasn this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration a conversation between Tom and this strange thing and external that it was not Tom .
So , as I felt that story started changing a little bit even the way I worked , and I was save me a time .
This idea , I save when I was writing " Manogy , Prega , Ama , " and falls in one of those cave caves of the dispersonally where we 're working on something and we won 't and we start thinking that it 's going to be disaster , which is the worst ever wrote .
Not just bad , just the worst books .
And I started thinking about gathering this project .
But then I remember Tom that I spoke to air and I sent it .
So I got my face on the managing and I realized my hundred of a vacuum wacuum of the room .
And I said high-voices , " Sent , what , you 're going to say that if this book is not going to be involved to not be interested in my , no ?
Because as I see , I 'm putting all I have , I don 't have more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to present , and make your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do .
I 'll start writing the same because it 's my work .
And I would like to please that I was recorded that I 'm presented to do my part , " because -- at the end is so , OK -- seats ago , OK -- seats ago , in the North people were sought for the middle of the middle of the middle , and music that they were going to go forward and hours .
And they always were magnificent , because the balleras professionists were professionals .
But every while , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually .
And I know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've all seen that you 've all seen , at a point , a performance so .
It was like the time stopped , and the ballery walking through a kind of ballery and wasn 't doing anything different from the usually , like 1,000 night before , but all of the 1,000 nights before , but it was moving .
And suddenly , it doesn 't appear like a human .
But it turns out to the die and the light in the fire of the divinity .
And when this happens , at the time , the people knew what was called him with his name .
They were congathering and started canting , " Allah , Allah , God , Allah , God , God . "
That 's God , you know .
Curious known stories -- when the Ms invading the South , the South , they were this abitude with them and the pronoundinner from " Allah , Allah , Allah , " in " Ole , " the south , " that you can hear in the shake or the flames .
In Spayn , when an artist has made something impossible and magic , " Allah , , the word , Allah , magnificent , burn , " ununderstandable , " and that I 'm going to go back God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But , the problem is the next day , for the ballery itself , when you wake up and discover that they are the 11 of Martedyes and the God of God and the God is no longer .
It 's just a mortal with bad for ginoccurred to the ginoccurred , and maybe it will never get to that height .
And maybe no one will be the name of God still as a gathering , and what does the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painted reconcilizes to make life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angorosciant if you can 't believe , indeed , indeed , the most extraordinary aspects of your being from yourself .
But you just believe that they 're asking you from an inimaginable source of this squisite of your life that you have to have to somebody else when you 've finished .
And , you know , if we think about this is changing .
And so I started thinking about , and it 's certainly like I thought about it for a few months , during the workplace that I would public , spent , and spent , waiting , and spent , and spent , waiting , followed my grandburst .
And what I have to continue to say , when I feel elected by this is , not afraid .
You don 't get you . It 's just your work .
It 's inua wind , whatever it could be .
If your work is dance , bad , bad .
If you 're going to lists you to lie a few kind of wonderful , for one moment through your efforts , just for a moment through your efforts , just just through your efforts , then , " Ole ! "
Otherwise , you do your dance .
And " Ole ! " " at yourself .
I think I have to teach it .
" Ole ! " at yourself , even for the himself , I had a huge and touching tals to get you continued to present continues .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And you know , I 've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can meaning and the discovery of new genes .
Now we 're starting a new way : we started to digitalize biology and now starting to the biology and now starting to the digital code , we 're entering a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We always tried to bring large questions .
" life ? " It 's something that many biologists , I think have been trying to understand and a vary livels .
We tried different approaches , reduced to the minimes .
We 're digitalizing almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to pass from the analogical world of the computer biology in the digital world .
Now , let 's ask us : we can regenerate life , or new from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest genitalium that can autoreum in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome for creating a little more smaller .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we take a look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple than our .
I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at a time , is very improbable that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to progrew was synthesize this chromosoma so that they could be able to get some of these questions .
And so we started the adventure of " Can we synthesize a cromosome ? "
Can chemistry to produce these big molecules that we never have been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can we make a cromosoma ?
A cromosoma is just a chemist of chemical material .
The speaker that we 're able to digitalize life is growing to exponential .
Our skills the genetic code , instead , rather , procrete greatly , but it 's improving .
And our most recently recently recently , they 're going to have exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process require a lot of pass , starting with a bioetic review before we began to the first experiments .
But we found that DNA synthesize that is very hard .
There are tens of thousand machines the world that producing small DNA , of the longer segment , of the latest is a process process process , more the segment is longer , the more errors .
So we had to develop a new way to assembly assembly these framments and correct the errors .
And this was our first tattempt , to start by digital information , and that 's the Phi 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills that kills .
We designed the framments , effectively the correction of errors and get a molecule of DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material inert and we put it into the bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this genetic code and produced the viral particles .
The viral particles have been required by the cells , they were back and destroyed the E. coli .
I 've been talking about recently oil with membranes of oil industry , they 're just compressed with this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the bigger things .
We wanted to build the whole cromosome of the bacteria .
They 're over 580 mysquare genetic code .
So we thought I 'd build it in cassettes of the virus that we can change the seven of the virus , so that we can change the components of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 accurately was a mile for every 10 thousand feels .
We found , resequency it , 30 errors . If we had that original sequence we never would be able to be able to do it .
One part of the process is designing 50 letters that they overwhelming segments that are overcome with all the other segments of the segments of them to work together .
We try to be the only one here .
You probably have an obvious that we put on the photos .
Think of it . We have a genetic code based on four letters : A , G and GG and Time .
Three of those letters together code about 20 minothacids , and there is a specific order to each amount of the letter to every amount of letter .
So we can use genetic code to writing words , framework , frages , thoughts .
What we 've done at the beginning was autograph to do .
Some have been delivered by the fact that it wasn 't poem .
We designed these segments to just just until it up with it .
There are enzymes that repair them and put them together .
And we started assembly assembly , starting with segments from five to segments from segments to segments , unending them to 24 miles letters .
We 've all step produced these abundance sequency , so that we 're sitting them down to create a extremely robad process -- you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems like the tabellon a basket .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 thousand , more than 100 thousand , they don 't grow more directly in the Ecoli .
We get to the limit of the modern instruments of molecular biology .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination , which in biological biological , that in biology is using DNA can stand to repair the DNA can bring the segments .
Here is an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radioden , it can absorbed three million rad rading .
You can see in the super requarter as his chromosoma is destroysome .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly like before .
They have thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely seedge .
They can live under empty .
They 're absolutely certain life exists exists , and you moving into space , and you move to find new water environments .
In fact , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built these processes , just using these processes , just using the lifetime to insert .
The leaved to assemble it .
This image was not taken with a microscope electronic microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It 's a big molecule that we can see it with a light microscope .
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publish we 've done very little time ago .
They 're more than 580,000 genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined structure that they 've ever made of the man .
It has a molecular weight to 300 million .
If we stop with a caratter 10 without spaces , you know , it would like 142 pages , it would just like 142 pages to transvisual this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it ? How do we activating it ?
Of course , you love a virus is a guys .
It 's a little bit more complicated when they use bacteria .
It 's easier even when it is about eucarious eucarious as our : you can just extract the nucleus and insert another , which is practically the clonation process .
In the archaeeeasy is integrated instead is integrated inside the cell , but we have recently demonstrated that we can do a transplant transplant by one cell and activating it .
We had a cromosoma starting from a microbial species .
The two are different as humans from the men .
We 've added a few genes that you can decide what choose to choose for this chromosome .
And then , then the skiolden with the enzymes ,
And when we put it in the cell was study -- and we appreciate our sophisticatoos -- the new cromosoma is going inside the cell .
And we were thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we 've tried to spingering us in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms .
We found that many species have added species have added a second or a third cromosome from some of a thousand new tracts of new tracts of the species .
So who think about evolution as a gene , as a gene , you know , it doesn 't understand a lot of biology .
And there is a lot of enzymes called restription that advoctopus that would be digital DNA .
The cromosoma that was in the cells , it doesn 't have one .
The cell phone that we have inserit-cell phone that we have inserit-like cell .
And it 's expressed , and he recognized the other chromosoma as an material , and masticated with only the cell and the new cromosome .
it became blue because of the genes that we 've got insered .
And in a short time , all the characteristics of a species have been going to allow , and it turned of all in a new species , based on the new software that we 've insered in the cell .
All proteins are changed , membranes are changed , and when we read the genetic code what we 've been transfer to what we 've been transfer .
Now , this could look at genetics , but it could be honey software DNA , we can change things in a lot of things .
Now , I 've already explained that here is not talking about genesis -- but progress to go from three and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion .
Why do that ?
I think it 's obvious when we think about our necessity .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people at nine billion in the next 40 years .
Right for example : I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 , there are four years , there are four .
We 're going to have problems now to find food , fresh water and cleaning , medicinal and gas and a half billion people .
It 's even more tough to nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon than 30 billion ooil , more than 30 billion oil baries .
That means millions of baries a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process them to reduce them , it 's going to be huge .
In the most of CO2 emission of the CO2 of these materials that ends in the atmosphere .
And so , thank you to scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are designed for the future .
The electronic industry is just a dozen about components , and think of how many different things came out .
Our limits here are basically data from the biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , thanks to these rapid metods of synthesization , that we call combine combinatory genomics .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million cromosomes a day .
Think of it processing these 20 million different genes or to prove the processes to produce either optimize or drugs , new vaccines , and new vaccine , and new vaccines , and more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology , and more biology .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for possibility to survive , production , chemical or fuel , production of vaccine ,
This is an instantaneous instantaneous instantaneous programmed on that we 're working for being able to sit and design species to the computer .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how they will be .
We know exactly what the genetic code .
We 're now concentrating on the fuel of quarters .
You also have seen that extract ethanol from the grate was a finished finished experiment .
We have a lot of seconds and third generation that will be surround by sugar birthium like either than than either than the eightan or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact of the food and limited without more than food and limitate the cost of food and limitate the availability to transform the CO2 in matter , so we 're working for design cells that can achieve this , and we think we could have the first carbon dioxious carbons .
The light sunlight , with CO2 is a metodown-to-the-floor -- but in our discoveries all over the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we have described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2500 feet of depth water temperature .
They record from CO2 , using molecular hydrogen as energy source .
We 're trying to figure out if we can incanallow CO2 , which can easily be transported by tubes , converting that CO2 in fuel , to drive this process .
So , in short we might be able to increase what the basic question is , what the basic life is Nooobic , and we have the goal modity , and we have the goal of replacing the whole oil industry .
Extally . If you can 't do it from TED , where you can ?
It would be a major source of energy .
And also , we 're working on the same ways to use the same ways to create instantaneous vaccines .
You 've seen this year with influence , we 're forth forth of a year and a dollar in less , when it 's about finding the wind is to find the wind .
I think that this is going to change building vaccinable vaccinable in ances .
This is how the future could start to look change , and now , the tree of evolution , accelerating the tree of synthetic bacteria , and indeed , and indeed involved .
We 're so on the way to improving people .
Our purpose is to do a long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
I 'll just show you , the most rapidly possible , a lot of work , some fundamental work , the new technology that we 've taken to Microsoft , in the way , and it 's just a year ago ago . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment that you can interact is local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of digital gabytal photos with a kind of zoom and continuous , for a panoramic sandscape , disponing , disponing the images like we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these sorts of data or images .
Most of them are digital photographs , but this is a examples from the Bioooowner of Congress , and relower in the crowd of 300 megapixel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen on any time . It 's also an architecture .
This is a whole book , example of not data .
This is the Dickens of Dickens . Each is a colonna represents a chapter .
To show you that it 's about text and not images , we can do something like that , to make something like that , to make a real representation of the text , not a photos .
It could be a little way artificial to read a little electronic book .
It 's not about it .
This is a more realistic example . It 's about a For the Wordian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and beautiful experience of reading the version of a magazine , or a quotidian , which is for nature , which is for nature a molteam , which is a lot of a half .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of The Guardian .
We created a higher advertising high-solutionary advertising -- much more higher than what you use in a normal publish publish -- and we put extra the extra deal .
If you want to see the characteristics , you can see them here .
Or other other model , or even the techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to iminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that that means to put up on the pop-up and the porks , and other porks like , you don 't have to be necessary .
Naturally , mapplications is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if we don 't say that we have contributes to this field up .
These are all the streets in the U.S. suethy subjects of NASA .
So , let 's go to something else .
This is actually , in the web , and you can go to the web ; you can go to the web .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research interesting computer in Noah Snavely , a student of University of Washington , with Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve , the Microsoft Research .
And it 's from Seb , gestite by Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this guys , where we can go from one image to the other image and have this kind of experience to the other and have this kind of experience .
But the space of the images here has actually a meaning meaning .
The algorithms of visualization computers have recorded these images together , so that correspond to the real place in which the images -- all of these imaging screens , and these are taken by the Lagen Roccious Desiesian -- they were taken . So , you see elements of a sweet . And so the da-standandandandandandscape , and these are all linked to space .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space .
I want to spend directly to one of the original Noaholding -- and this is from a prototype of Photosynnnthrow that we 've done for the first time , you know , the technology is the key to show you what this technology is the key behind this technology , the Photosynth . And it 's not necessarily evident . And it 's not necessarily existing the environments that we put in the website .
We had to worry about legal aspects and forced .
This is a rebuilding of the Notre of Notre Dame images from Flickr . Baast Dame in Flickr , and you get images of the shirt , other campus and you get images in the magic , and so on . Each of these arancions represents an image that is discovery appear to this model .
So , they 're all pictures from Flickr and they were all connected to the space level in this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this very simple way simple .
You know , I 'd never thought I 'm going to end up with Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying this kind of accouncience here .
I think you can see that it 's about a lot of different types of kinds of switch : from those phones to the SLR phones , a number of meaningful , must , in this environment .
And if I can , I try to look for those strange .
Many , they 're wood block , etc .
And somewhere here is a series of photographs -- here .
This is a Notre Notre Dame recorded correctly .
We can move from the poster to the vist physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the entire connected -- from the whole memory of visual vote -- and connect all of those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , more than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the earth that emerges .
Think of this as a such as Stephen Lawler 's work of virtual Earth .
It 's something that growing in complexity as as people to use it , and the advantages for people to grow the use .
Their pictures are handed with insert meters ,
If somebody is the idea of assigning all these saying saying the name , my photos of Notrich chthedral of Notrich Dimproviously , and I can use it in the space , and I can use it in that metaphor , in that metaphor , in that metaphing , and have a social experience of cross-mobile cross-moed experience of cross-mobile red and red by cross-moed , cross-cross-mobile .
Naturally , a consequence of this are virtual model of all interesting , in the earth , and collecting not just from an airplanes , and satellite images and similar , but from college , but from the college memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand what ? What your software is going to be able to do is that there , in the next few years , all the shared photographs from anyone in the entire world will be practically connected together ?
BAA : Yeah . What it 's doing is basically discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the basis on content of the images .
And what it becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of semantis that many of these images are possible images that many of these images are possible images .
As when you get a research on the Web , you digits a srase and the text on the web page has a lot of information about the images of the picture .
Now , what if that is it happening if that pictures up to all your pictures ?
So , the amount of interconnection and the amount of wealth that is really huge . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the major pleass when you travel and one of the delicies of the research that they don 't forget the anti-traditions , between who he has no forget the anti-traditions , the past of the pleass , the drive of rain , driver , he 's driving with plants .
Basti think that Jaguar travel even beyond the Via Lattea , or that the old Inuit , or that the old Inuit still , or that in Himalayas , the budddists are still follow the Dharma , to remember the importance of the Dharma , to remember the major of the anthropologies , and that the idea that the world that the world that the world that the world that we live in the absolute , but it ,
the consequence of a particular set of adaptations that our own own own own is bad , or a lot of generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
Everybody is born . We do .
We 're suggests of initiation .
We need to death the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprise and ballize --
We all have an art .
What it hits is the putting ral rhythm of the song of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they are the Penan of the Borneo , or the following of the Haiti of Haiti , or the guerriors of the Kenya settries , Kenya sthree-d-heart cammammmmouth , or a cammammmmarize in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey of travel in the desert a month ago , or a yak of yak , or a yak of yak Qomolangous , on the mother of the world .
All of these people teaching us that there are other ways to existing other ways of thinking , other ways of modes , other ways of modes of thinking , other ways of being moved in the world .
And , if you reflect a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
And along , the world 's cultures of the world , a spiritual life and cultural life that has the planet and cultural life that is important for the planet and is important to the well-being and the planet as the remote note as a neighborhood as a neighborhood as a neighborhood .
And you can think about this cultural record like an etnosmooth and you can define the lately realized the total of all the concepts , dreams , moved , ideas , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuition ,
The ethnosphere is a patrimony of humanity .
It 's the symbl of what we are and what we can be in how inquisitive .
And because the biosphere was a very large consumed by the way , etnosatic and purroothnosatic and purroothnice .
No biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent of all species has been or the high of the extinction of simply because it 's false -- in the most apocalyptimistic -- and you don 't even even even as close to the hypoeth -- that of the cultural diversity .
The index of all of that is , of course , the language .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a vocabulary vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the shake of the human spirit .
It 's the midddle that the animal of every culture is coming in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a forest , a thought , a spiritual ecosystem .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we sat Monterey , at least half is not sleeper in the ears of children .
They don 't have more teached to children , which means , unless you know , unless you won 't wild something , which is already death .
What 's more sad than the sad than the silence , of being the last to talk a language , not to have a language , not to have a language of the wisdom of the promise , or ancient the promise the promise of children ?
This orrunning was the state of somebody in the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , an old mues , and it 's taking the last last syllabes of an ancient language .
And I know somebody to say , " Isn 't it better ?
The world would not be a better place if we 're going to talk about the same language ? " Bensim , then we talk about yoruba . We talk cantonese .
Let 's talk about key .
You 're going to cover a tract thing that means you can 't talk about language .
Today , I would like to do a journey through the labor --
a little journey in the etnosatic to give you a little bit of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of existing truly different ways of existing existing .
Let 's take for example this Barasana , in Amazon , the sector , the popular of anacony , who crees the myth of the snake of the swave of the snake of swave .
It 's a popular that is not able to distinguish the blue , because the blue is identified in the time the forest is identified in the time forest , which depends the popular .
They have a strange language and a matrimonic language , he said , " You have to marriage a language . "
And all of that radical in the past past , yet the particular one is that in these exists that are in these families that are talking about six or seven languages , no practice a language .
They 're limited to listen to listen and then start to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , which I lived , the Waorani , the Wake of Ecuador , a popular that has been the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have taken a committing contact .
They did it down from the high photographed them in a very popular population , forget that this popular population of pluvial forest .
They collected the photos , they turned them to search of a shape and , not finding nothing , they have concluded that they were treated to the display , and they killed the five missionarious missionary with the lance .
But Waorani not only killed the straneous thing .
They killed in them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We 're risalites at eight generations and found two natural death , and when we stand to know , they have loved that one of them was invited so that he was invited so that he died , and then killed him . And then they killed him . And then they were killed with an amazing knowledge of the forest .
The crawings were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the first 1980s , I was assigned a very interesting task when my Harvard professor of Harvard asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti me if I want to go to Haiti me a base of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and impossessare that I used to do the zombies .
To give a sense of miraculous miraculous , I should have to understand the Vodoun culture and that Vodoo is not magic .
It 's pretty much of complex metaphysical vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to say big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Budddism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has not been religious . And instead of yes . And instead of not a religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of the cluster , deep the tragic concept of slavery .
What makes the voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , you know , you know , the spirits .
They can be invited by Great Acqua Great , they respond to the dance of dance and replaced temporary to the soul of the view of the way , which for a brief across the god .
So , the voodooists like , " You know white , white , you know , God .
We 're saying in the temple and forget God . "
And the moment you 're going to be , is the spirit that you 're driving you , how can you do the bad ?
So you 're incredible at these incredible events : following voodoor in the state of trance that touch , they 're touch a rather strongly demonstration of the power of mind , when it 's catalyed in a state of extreme extreme .
And in all the people who have lived the most extraordinary of the most amazing of Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta , in Colombia sector sector .
Each ancivilization of the tyrance civilization that once had been living on the planning of Colombia in the waiting of the conquister , the popular was walking on the waiting .
In a blood continent , this popular , this popular never been conquisted by the spagnology .
And so , in fact , they have government by a cler-often , but they 're very extraordinary .
The young people are brought away from the families to three or four years , and they live secreged in a good world , and they have secreged in a good world and sheet in the ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years of the proposition to reproduce the nine months of gestation that spent in the usering of the mother , now are metaphorically in the usering of Great Mother .
And so , so that time , they accultured to their society , values that predict their predict and just their predict their predict and just their predict , they keep the cost , and they 're going to say , " Halance .
At terminal the earthquake , and they 're suddenly taken out and for the first time in life , at the age of the age of the first ones of the first wrong , the run of the first wrong , when the sunder the beautiful beautiful , when the sunlight is the wrong valley , everything that they learned theory . It 's been confired everything that they learned behind , and says ,
" Go ? I 'm told you .
It 's amazing . It 's to you protect it . "
It 's called larger brothers and say that we , the minor , we are the minor , we are the colpatures of the world .
This is intuition is extremely important .
When we think about indeed populations and the environment , we 're in the invote , and the old story of the noble selective , which is a razy concept in its simplicity or perhaps we 're closer to the Earth .
The ingenes are not feeling , or indebull .
There is no space for these things in the paluds of Aststage or the gelids of the Tibet , but thanks of the Tibet , but in the way , and they created a mystical mystical wintuition : the concept that the Earth can only live in the war that the Earth can only live in the war . It can only live because it 's infection .
What does it mean ?
That 's a boy of Ande that a boy of Ande that the mountain is a spirit of Apu who will drive his destiny is going to be a human destiny different human report and will have a very different report and it will be a very different rock of Montana who growing up with a boy of Montana who grows that a male mountain is a mass of a path amer , and you 're going to be waved .
That 's the dead of a spirit or a mineral waste is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the relationship between individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forest of the Britannica Britannica creding that the forests served to be cut .
And that was made me a human being from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the forests of Hukuk and the short of paradise and the stories of paradise and the spirits that live in the north of the world , spirits that they 're dealing in the world , spirits .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different , different , you can start to understand some of their sensitive discoveries . We take this plants .
I took this picture to open in the northern Amazon Nororthes .
Maybe some of you 've heard about ayahuge , the most powerful pricing pricing of the repertoire of the sciamanic repertoire .
What does it fascinating the ayahuge is not the physical potential of the substance , but the process . It 's composed to two elements .
He 's a legacy , this legacy legacy that contains a series of betacarboline , harmine and hares , reading harm-moles , reading .
Take the only plant is a blue smoke that altery a little bit the consciousness , but it 's mixed with the leaves of a family said Psychotria redis saying ,
This plant contains switch , very similar with serotonin the serotonin the serotonin the methoxyltryltryltrypamine .
If you 're ever going to see the nass on the nass of the nass that do a lot of set , which is extended methoxyltryltryltryltryltryltryline .
And so you 're going to be in the nose is like being shooted by a little bit like being shooted by a smoke of path path and landing on a sea of electricity . It doesn 't create a destroke of reality .
I had often often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who brought the psychedelic , with his discovery of fungi , in Mexico .
I think I 'm not going to be able to do these tripamine like hallucinogens because if you 're not going to tell anybody of being hallucinated . And the tripamine . And the tripamine , they can 't be horely horely because they are money from a physical enzyme that 's naturally in the intestine , detailed , and it 's unknown in the intestine , deterased by a clear , detection , and it 's not very high examinosent .
It 's possible to absumerely if you just have a little bit of other substances that money the MAO .
Now it 's the beautiful : : Icarboline that are in this liana liana are inhibitors of MAO , the same kind of the same kind of potential , which is such a 80,000 species of plants , like these people are being found two dead raints , but if you combine in this way , they can create biochemical version that is summous about the sometimes of parts ?
We use the big euit of proof the error and error , that can infruit .
But if we wonder to the Indians , they 'll tell us , " The plants are talking . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuash , who are distinguished in the forest , and that our eyes would be revenues in the same species .
If we wonder how they are they going to be tasonomics say , " I thought I 'd think of plants , I don 't know all ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take the 17 varieties in a night of bunch of bunch and each night with a tone .
With this is not sleeping to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting to contate the stami .
Now , [ you know the problem is that even the ones of us who have heart the people who have heart people who are pitting their popular , but in a reduced way to the margins of history in our real world , and pass beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it will not remembered for his wars or its innovations , but rather than like the early that we stopped and we have been used to huge , and activally aboently destruction of the biological diversity of the biological diversity of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians don 't stopped to be Sioux when they put out of it and falling and falling as Americans have not stopped to be Americans when they put out of Americans , when they put out of horse and calved .
It 's not the change or technology that they minattempts the integrity of ethnosatic . It 's the power .
The during the domination of domination .
And if you look at the world , you 'll find that these are not cultures that these are not cultures destined to disappear .
They are living creatures and dynamics dynamics that existence from identifiable forces that go beyond their ability .
The indeed with the Patria of the Penan Patria --
a popular noades in Sarak , in the souest , a popular who lived on the forest , a popular who lived in the forest until generation , and now reduced to the services of the rives of the rive of the rives , where you can see the rive of the rives , the naves of the MCinese Merday , where naves the Middle MCerodies , where naves the holes of naves ,
Take the standing woooden the woooden .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that have come to the gold .
If we move on the Tibet mountains of the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard of politics .
As you know the genocide , physical extinction of a popular , is convicted to universal level , but the ethnocide , the destruction of the lifestyle , not just convicted , it 's not conditions , but it 's also a cell of development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet is suffering of the Tibet until you 're part of the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China , in China , in the Western Tibet , coming to Lhasa with a young who is connected to a young , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what we feel about .
6,000 sacres sacres in polyes and crazy .
1.2 million people killed by the military military during the Cultural Rivolution .
The guy of this guy was ascritical to Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to the time of the Chinese invasion .
Her , it 's smote with Sua Santity during the death that he brought the popular in Nepal .
Her mother was impresoned and his colpath was rich .
It was taken to hide on caring on the age of two years , hidden under his gonna because he could not live without him .
The sister , who did the same , was in the field of reeducation .
And one day has washed a couple of a coffiguring switch , and , for this transgression , was put on the works for seven years .
The Tibet can be insopatable , but the spirit of the Tibet is holding .
And then , all of course , it 's all reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the world monotony or we want to according the policymatic policymac or of the diversity ?
The big anthropologa Margaret Mead , before he said that his biggest later was that , in our way to go to this amores of the world , we 're going to see the whole gamma of human imagination , we 'll think , but one day we 'll see a sleeping of the soner , but one day day we 'll see from a sleeping soner of the soner , even that there were other possibility .
And it 's umiliating our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The Neolitics revolution , who gave us agriculture , who did enced us to the seed culture of the seed culture of the seed , and we talk with the prosh prose of the cler , creating the gerarchy of specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has been 300 years .
That shelf history doesn 't suggests that we have the answers that we have the answers that we have to have the challenges that we have to get .
When these are cultures of the world is asked what it means to be human , what it means to be human , they say with 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all risky the possibility of being what we are are : a conscious , that it has to make all the people and all the garden can transporing . And there are great optimism .
I took this picture on the northrow the north of Baffin , when I went to the hunt of the Balin the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , he tells me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The government is not always been kindly the Inuit and the 1950s and in the ' 50s to stand in the ' 50s , we 've require them .
The grandfather of this man reflected to go .
The family , teaching for his life , brought him all the arms , and all of his aces .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't themselves the cold ,
The bad of the sliterally were made of fish bad skin the skin skin .
The grandfather than this man didn 't intimise from the arctic night or the library that suffering .
It 's gathered off , and it turned the pantalones in the skin and defected in your hand defected in their hand . When the sets are congelated , they work with a mob .
It sprayed on the door of this cut caccess and when they became solid , he killed a dog .
He washed the dog and created a brid , with the cash house house handed a sleeped , he imbrid another dog , and it 's disappeared on the banker , and it 's disappeared on the banker ,
We want to talk about cavarsely with nothing ? [ Rism ] And this , in different ways , [ Apausi ] is the symbl of the Inulience of the Inuit and all the people in the world .
In the 1999 government , the canady redded by Inuit , the total control of a larger area of territory area of California and Texas , and Texas mitted .
It 's the new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's an independent territory . They 're all the minerary resources .
One spendes of how a nation-state can recognize with his popular .
And , finally , I think it 's rather obvious at least who of us was in these remote remote on the planet , remote that they don 't have remote remote .
For somebody is home .
They represent of human imagination that are treatment to the high of the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , like the dreams of the children , become part of the geography of the hope .
Finally , we have National Geographic . We convinced that politicians will never get to nothing .
We believe that polemiics --
[ Applauses are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the world , maybe we 're the best institution to tell the world . Each our site . Each our website .
156 countries transmit our television canal .
Our revided , you know , how much people are .
Our work is travel to bring our audience to bring our audience in places of wonders , the cultural world from which they 're going to go away from how they have seen , hope , huge , they will be able to be in the central diversity , and multicultural world : the existing of life in a plurala world and multicultural .
where the wisdom of all the popular wisdom .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope that I hope you 've already heard and evidence to evidence some connects , in case , not the notakes them born .
I want to start with what I call " the " official dogma . "
Is the official dogma of what ?
The official dogma of all industrial society , the dogma is the official dogma is : " If we want to massive to benefits of our citizens . " The way to do is massive individual liberty . "
The reason is , from a side , in the fact that freedom is in itself a value , is precious , useful , and it 's precious , useful , essential for humans .
And the other one is that if we 're free , if we 're libes , each of us can act for all that massive to our well-being , no one that decided to our well-being ,
The way to massive freedom is massive freedom .
More choices , the more people are , and more than they are free , and more , the more of the well-being .
This , I think , it 's so propected in society that nobody would dream to put it in doubt .
And it 's also deeply radical in our lives .
I 'll show you some examples of what progress has made possible possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I permit a simple note about conditions .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without the 10 variety of oil and the 12 oil and 12 acetes , and 12 acetes that you can buy for you a huge number of conditions in the field that none of the 175 of pronts is your degree .
Here is what supermarket .
And then you go to electronic store to buy a stereo : cassine , CD , lector , radio , radio , radio , plag , plag , the CD , radio , the CD , radio , radio , radio , plag , radio , the CD , radio , the CD , radio , the CD , radio , and you can go to buy a stereo :
And in this single electronic negotie , there 's a big number of components .
We can do six and a half million different combinations using the components that there are only one store .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Others , the world of communications .
I once a child , when I was a child , you could get all the phone services of the phone services that were provided by mom Bell .
It was wasn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , between the other , was that the phone was that the phone would never break .
These template ,
So , we have a variety of phones , especially in the phones .
Here 's the mobile phones of the future .
My favorite is the midddle , MP3 , cut of the nose , and the shape , and the sheer for the crash .
If you don 't know that in the store under the store in the home , you 're going to be able to be .
And what happens is that people enter in the stick and does this question . And you know , what is the answer ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the acquists , is the same thing to be explosion of choices .
Ausequence health . It doesn 't happen to the United States you waiting to the doctor and the doctor say what you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and doctor says , " OK , we could do A , or B , or B " has these benefits and these risks , " B has these benefits and these risks . What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Does , what would I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , and these risks , and these risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you can rebad if she was me , what would do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not like . "
The result of the result of the maled , expression that makes it look like a beautiful thing .
But actually , it 's not that a move the weight and responsibility of taking decisions from somebody knows something , which is doctor , to somebody else -- and almost of course , and almost of course , it 's not conditions -- and it 's not in the ideal decisions to take decisions , which is not in the ideal .
There is a huge marketing of pharmaceutical products , direct people like me and you , that if you think about it doesn 't make sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why we have publishing them ?
The answer is that they want to doctor , we call the doctor for asking to ask them to change the recipe .
Something that is the fundamental as is our identity is a question of choice , how you see in this vignize " we don 't want to proach children . We don 't want to proach the children . " We don 't want to proach the identity : we have to invent .
And we can reinvent how many times us .
which means that every morning , at the risvey , you have to decide that kind of person wants to be .
I spect the family and marriage , a time the common time , sent the common , sent almost for anyone , was that he was moving the most possible possible , and he started to the most possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not when , and not even what to do after .
And it 's really about it .
I teach very smart students , and I do 20 percent of work than a time .
And not because they 're not brilligent , not because they 're diligent .
but why are they impensierites , I mean , " Would I wish , I would be married or not ? I should have it now ? "
" Would I wish to marrier ? " I have to think about the children or the career ? "
They are logative interrogorants .
And they try to answer these questions , even if this implicts , not completely compasitions that asked and not get a beautiful vote to my examples .
And they really have to do it . They are important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl , who was a cluster , because it allows us to work every day , every day , from every corner of the planet , and transply-.
And in parently parently , there 's a corner , and I 'll not tell you what , where the WiFi works .
I don 't say , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible freedom of choices that we have about the work ? It 's that we have to decide , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our child play , with the mobile phone , the mobile phone in a tax , Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the notebook ,
And even if they are spent , every minute that we see our child , we see our baby , we 're also asking , " I have to answer to this called ? "
" I have to say this letter ? I have to abbol this letter ? "
And even when the answer is no , " all this makes the experience of your child , very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the ones , and big things , and large materials and large materials and lifestyle , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Obout , there were some possibility , but it wasn 't all about choice .
The world of the world world is like this : The dilemma is : Is it a site , or negative ? "
The answer is , the answer is Sholding .
We all sorts of positive them , so I 'm going to talk about the negative ones .
And all of this choice is two negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxically is that produces paralysis that produces instead of liberation .
With so many options of which choose to choose , becomes very hard to do it .
I give you a meaningful example : a conduct on the plans of volunteer .
A colleague has access to the Vanoloes , the gigantic data , with about a million clients of pension , with about a million clients imperved in 2,000 companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offering in more , the lower of adesion , the lower of two percent .
With 50 funding on the offers , there is 10 percent of adesions than when they are available to when they are available . Why ?
Because with 50 funds of the way to choose , is sick , it 's sick to decide , and the choice is remainly remaintain .
And at questions , and I still questions , questions , questions , and questions , and of course , and questions , and of course , and of course , and of course , and questions , of course , and questions , and of course , and questions , and of course , and questions , and of course , and questions , and of course , and I would never get to questions , and of
You know that doesn 't just mean that these works mangering to mangering food for canoes because they don 't have enough money , it means that the decision is so ostic that they 're losing the funding of complementary work .
It wasn 't going to go , they 're losing to five dollars a thousand dollars for the work dator , which would be well disposed to true them .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world like this .
" finally , " ethugly , " ketchup , senaps or maionese ? "
You want to take the right decision , if it 's for eternity , if it 's for eternity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong source , and or the wrong conditions .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoid the paralysis to do a choice , and at the end , we 're less satisfied by the result of how we would have been with less options of what we would choose .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions in which choose , if you buy one and it 's not perfect , and it 's not perfect , you can imagine that you could do a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us industry , and the reduced the smart , and the replaced the soul the recently involved the decision ,
And even when it was a good decision .
More choices are , the easier , the easier of any dawn detail that 's insodings of the choice .
Also , there is what economists call constood .
Dan Gilbert asked very well as a lot of things that we 're doing things that we 're doing things that we 're in the way that we compare .
In the rest , when there are many options that are possible options , it 's easy to represent the exists of the option of the option that is choices .
Here is an example . I school with all the ones that are not New York .
But that 's what you probably think .
There is this bad with the Hamptons .
A place of luses .
It 's beavailable . Ottimate day . It 's all for them .
Nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , malth , it 's August . "
" All my neighbors to Manhattan are forth . "
" I could talk about front of home . "
And it spend two weeks , from the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking things where it wants .
The constood is decrease the satisfaction for what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And more than the options that we have to consider , more the characteristics that are going to be returned against how expensive opportunity .
Here is another example .
This vignize us a lot of things .
It talks about to live the moment , and maybe living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you 're choose , you know , you know , you know , you don 't do others .
The things that we don 't choose are tactive to attractive that they can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : it 's growing expectations .
I tried it on my skin buying a new jeans .
I 'm just like jeans .
And , once the jeans were just like , buy them and bestivestivestivestivestive , they were dissixed , just after they were putting them and work , and they were going to go well .
So , I went to buy a new when the old ones were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
And the committed said , " He wants to slim phit , he 's relaxed to him ? "
Do you want to make it with the box or with the books ? "
" Do you want to be strapped ? "
" Soting them takes a large , hundred blaw , " Bodddle blaw .
I was smart , and after a little bit , I was able to say , " I want the guess of the kind of thing that was , " I want to be the only kind of tried jeans , and then I went out of the blocks , and then I went out , the best couple of jeans that I 've ever had .
It was the massive . And all that choices I had got the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was worse that I was like all the choice , I was very high , jeans , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was waiting , I waiting . I waiting nothing when there was only a guy , but when it was in 100 different , and it was like , but when I saw 100 different , so it had to be perfect .
What I was bought , but not perfect .
And after I had compared that choose to what I was trying to do with what I was trying to introducative .
The add options in life of people who don 't do the expectations that these have respond to the excellence of the options of the same options .
And this will produce less satisfififation , even when the results are good .
No one in the marketing world , if you realize it .
Because if they knew , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth is more about this .
" He was better when he was worse " The reason why he was better when he was worse , he was that when he was worse , when he was worse , you know , when he was worse , you know , I think , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , when he was worse , he was even better .
And the world that we live in -- opulents , and the citizens of citizens , the massive that we can hope is that the things are at the high-expectative .
You never have surprised to your expectative , because your expectations , the mies are waitable .
The secrets of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse expectative , " Yes , you want . "
I mean -- small authobiography -- that I 'm really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't do better , I couldn 't do , I didn 't have accounted .
But to do not always have a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of the comprate of jeans is that when there is just that when you 're not satisfacts , and you wonder , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " The answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a insoddisatisfacing , and you 're asking the responsible , it 's the responsible , it 's the responsible , is the responsible to you .
You would have to do better .
With hundreds of available variety , there are no excuses for the insuccess .
So when people are going to decisions , even if the result is wallow , they feel introduced and they give the colcolcolors to themselves .
In the last few years , the depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a meaningful factor -- not the only , but important -- of this depression is that the depression of the depression of the depression of the people because standards are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that colcolcolor is them .
So the final result is that we 're better , general , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it is completely fake . It 's not true .
There is no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than haven 't really affected , but it wasn 't even more than you have a little bit better than you .
There is a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure that we 've been playing that we 've been playing the level where the choices are improve our life .
Now , from political point of view -- I 'm almost finished -- from political point of view , the political nocity is the following .
What 's allows all this choice in industrial society is the material .
There are many places in the world , and you know about it , where the problem is not they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too a little bit too little .
So the factory of the modern I 'm talking about is a smodern existence of the modern , recently society .
And what does depriming and arrage is this : Steve Levitt talked about how much those expensive and discovered out of how much those expensive baby are inuseful . It 's a spre-money .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendious , it 's not just involved .
They 're in a short of them .
They get worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows us choices were reverse to those where people have too poory , it would not just be able to improve , but also our life .
This is what economists call a paretian improvement .
A redistribution of the redirection is good at all -- not just the poor -- because of this choice in excess that it comes back .
For conclude , " wonderful , you can become everything you want --
You know , people of culture , think , " What does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get to a glass of glass . "
" A imagination castrated , a limited vision of the world -- "
And I 've been interested in this , at the beginning .
But then , think , instead , instead , I realize that that fish the long-gone .
Because the reality of fact is that if you eat me , you 're sent the boat , so that " you don 't get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you buy the boat so that all divent possible to decrease .
You 're going to get the paralysis , and you 'll reduced the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too much , maybe even for fish , and even even the fish , and of course , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic symbolic and , themselves , for the rovement .
Thank you very much heart .
