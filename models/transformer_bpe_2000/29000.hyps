I 've shown this last year I showed these slides to show that the glacial glacial heat , which for almost three million years had the size of the United States continental , it 's refted 40 percent .
But this is the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the throw of the ice .
The artica glacial calots is , in a way , the heart of the global climate system .
You can expand to inverther extensions .
The next slide is going to be a fastern lower to be 25 years .
The ice gets are signed in red in red .
You see , you walk up to the blue .
That is the ice in winter , which is the winer , which is summmer .
You can see that the ice ice ice ice ice ice , and five years , is like the blood , which is like blood , which is like the blood here .
In 25 years , it was spent by so .
This is a problem because the warming interest in the glacier of the glaciers around the ocean artical quantities of coal congeled that , switches , they 're transformed in the microbes .
I spect to the totality of the atmospect of global warming , that amount of global warming , that amount of the world 's double .
In some deeply laghi laghi , in Alaska , the methane is already rebullting out of water .
The professoressize Katey Walter of Alaska , a team was rected with a team taka bottom of the score .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You 're good . The question is if we 're going to be .
A reason is that this termic exchange surroyed Greenland from the northermal .
This is a glacial reme .
The brought her levels .
This is the Kangerlushaq , in the southwest of the Greenland .
If you want to know how the sal level of the sea level of the ice of the ice of the ice on land on terraferred .
These corrings are increasing rapidly .
On the other side of the planet : Antartica , the biggest block of the planet .
The month last month , the scientists have diquared that the balances of the ice is in negative , and that Antarctica , which is particularly fastern ises , and it 's particularly fastern .
Eququeue to six feet of the level of the active level .
On Himalayas , the third biggest blowing ice , you see new laghi laghi , which few years ago were glaghers .
Fist percent of the world 's population will be population as population as well as the slide .
Sull Ande : this glacier is the source of the water source of this city .
The brought it is increased .
But when it decreases , the same happens to the water .
In California the snow on the Sierra Nevada is diminuit of 40 percent .
Biins are in crime .
Ppredictions , like you read , are floor .
The growth of the world 's growing to a remarkable increase in the figure .
The environmental disasters are increasing out of the normal and without precedented .
Four times more number number of times in the last 30 years , I 've been respect 75 .
This is a whole sustainable thing .
If you look at it in the historic consequences .
In the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 24 hours of tons in the ocean every day .
Look attentially the area of Pacific , from the Americas Pacific , and on both the parts of the substitute , where there is a south impoor of the oxygen ocean .
The major cause of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent of fossils .
Oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions , together at China .
And it was proposed to build many other central power .
But we 're seeing a change of direction .
These are the annoullate projects in the last few years and some proposes of alternative .
In every way , there 's a politics in our country .
The coal industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting coal , which is a clean , which is a bone .
And that image me to reminds me something --
I 'm going to be in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion lights of carbon dioxide .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second bigger flow of scories in America .
It happened around the Natal .
The nature of one of the coal industries of one of the coal industries was this .
Video : Frosty the carbon is a purpose , and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's going to grow our economy .
Frosty the carbon is and more and more public .
It 's good at the price , adorable and workers are the styppull .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest mineral societies is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'm going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Aleance for the Proteition of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one side .
Video : Actor : Actor : Actor 's going to see climate change as a serious threat to our business .
So , our priority is to invest a big amount of money in a effort to make public and confused the truth of coal .
In fact , coal is not sports .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also good .
So not preokay , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
Let me do it .
Video : Actor : Carbone , you 've heard a lot of them to talk about .
So let 's make a turn around in a structure at the pattern of the patterns .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noise , but this is the sound of the coal technology .
carbon consumption is between the major causes of global warming , but the night of coal warming , but the night of coal technology ,
You 're a look , this is the hodial technology of clean .
Al Gore : Indeed , the alternative works is connects to economic questions and to the economic security .
Video : Compractice : America is in crisis ; the national security , the national security .
The field that the lines all : our dependence of fossils , like the sport and oil .
Now , but , there is a new , car , a new , car solution for it .
Repower America : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work , make sure more sure , and help us stop global warming .
It was inally , a solution that you 're going to solve our problems .
Repower America . Scover more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Compractice : It 's about re-in-America .
One of the faster ways to get the end of the faster ways to dependence on comfort that we kill our planet .
What it 's here . Sun future is here . Sun , only one new energy .
What it 's two : Noves investment for the workers of workers .
Compractice : Repower America . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old old African proverbial African says , " If you want to go fast .
If you want to go away , go together . "
We need to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I did an introduction on the LHC .
And I promise to advances on how the machine works .
So here I am . And for those that the other time , there was no LHC is the biggest scientific experiment never tented -- 27 miles of circusters .
His task is to remember the conditions that were under a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
This is simply environment .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
We 're pictures these mini-Big mini-Bang inside .
This is what I work . Yes is called ATLAS -- it 's 44 feet and it 's a 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions .
Ten September 10 last year we have acceserl , we have acceserl the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because it was immense to stand control .
It 's a picture of the first phasm of the first skin of the LHC , enty , entering in collision , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles within the refering .
In other words , when we saw that image 10 10 , the September , we figure out that machine works , which is a great victory .
I don 't know if that was this to make us exultate us , when someone went to Google and saw that the page was this .
What means we had a cultural impact beyond that scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to these dorders here -- these dored drugs .
These files are 13,000 printing when the machine works at the massive of power .
Now , the technicians between you look at the children and say , " It 's not true . I 'm too sound ptiles . "
And instead they can do it because when they 're very cold slies are very cosidden flows .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a temperature inferior to the star of the space between the stars , these files can bring that corporate .
In one of the juntures of the most of names in the LHC , there was a fect fit .
So the files are warming , they 're slightly , and the 13,000 practical practical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think these magnetic magnets more than 20 tons , and that have been moved about 30 cents .
You 're damaged about 50 magnetic .
We had to take them , what we 've done .
We restined them and adusted .
Now , they 're now returning all of their place .
It 's the end of march the LHC will be again .
We 're going to accensive , and we 're expecting data to be right or lights to go to the right data and continue so our adventure to discover what the morning is the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents reacting the debate on the value of science and engineering . It 's easy to be . It 's easy to confuture .
I think that the fact that it 's so difficult , the fact of going to go beyond the limits , I think it 's value .
I 'd like to end with the words of a scientist Inglends , Humphrey Davy , which , I imagine , in defense experiments of its own experiments of his own , Michael Faraday , he said , " Nichael is a very dangerous for the human mind , how much of the human remind as the world , and that 's not a very dangerous , that we don 't have been in nature , and that our monstery , and that our mones are not completely misterself .
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink about when children , you 're going to play with the morning .
While you realize how to reach them and to take them and move them , and move them , learn to think and move them , actually to think and solving problems and manipulating relationships .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , as information is a ushed by our interaction with physical objects , with my conon Pat , and my collaborator , I started asking , " And if we use a computer , I started asking , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only cursor as a digital labor , we could deal with a desktop of digital swital source ,
and we systemard-pleasure ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable , a Siftable computer computer interactive as a birth .
In a few words , a Siftable , a Siftable computer computer interactive as a birth .
You can move with hand , they can see them , " You can see , " among their movement and have a radio and a radio radio radio .
But most of course , I 'm physical objects , like the morning , you can move simply to further .
The Siftable is a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate information .
And as they become more physicists , conscious , the same , of others , and as they become more physicists , conscious , of how we move , we can explore new and fun and fun new slower and fun .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurated to show the video : if it including it in a direction , the video video rrun so , if you including the other side .
These interacts are relation-aware of other .
If you 're interested in what they 're interested in what they 're going .
If they 're surrounded , and they can act a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , and they can act a little bit .
They are also their movement and inclination .
We realized one of the interesting implications of the interaction of the interaction was the power of the communals , to squid , for example , " to put a color like a color like it .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurated as secks and I can use them to color in that central color in that central .
and I can use them to put them in color in that central color , where they mix .
We can get a lot of them , we can put a little place .
You also are beautiful possibilities to learn , like languages , the mathematics and games where people can try to do things fast , and see the results of the results , and you see the results of the results .
Now , I 'm --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a equations of equations .
Here we have a game of words that is half between Scarabeo and Boggle .
Pratically , at every turn turn out of a letter in any Siftable , Pratically , at every turn table , in any touches on every Siftable , and while trying to go to buy words him on a direction .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you can get a new set of letter and new ability to try .
Thank you .
Here 's children came to the game in the Media Lab , I did it so that they tried them and turned a video .
They are very fairly .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people a lot of education .
You 've got to say , " You know , " Compones of the words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's how other people are trying to .
This is our younger testers , there on the right .
It really wanted to impact them .
They were only morning , for him .
Now , this is a cardboard application .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of the languages .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving Siftable , they sold their associated .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving Siftable , they sold their associated .
So , it 's doing sung .
Video : Sun is source .
David Merrill : Now he brought a tractor in the scene .
Video : The arancient treator .
In the work ! Yes !
So I school with the Siftable and put them close to bring their neighbors --
Video : Bau !
and by inventing your story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It 's a story with the final , and it can decide him how you fly .
DM : It 's a story with the final , and it can decide him how you fly .
Video : Volunger : Volunger .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool , recently , to be made of recently , to walk and exected music .
It 's a tool , recently , to be a recently , to sample and execture .
Siftable here are growing from suons like base , based and the bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also insert these sounds in a sequence to compare to your pleasure .
And it just to move it to just doing a touching , and a sequence .
These are actually actually that you can control from the vive and filter .
I 'm going to a particular sound and then including to advice .
And then there are the general effects as time and fly , which you 're going to the whole sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : DM : DM : We 're going to put a base in two Siftable , we 're going to put it into a series , we add it , we add other base .
Now I put a lower line .
Video : DM : Now I add some percussions --
Video : And I 'm going to put the filter of the bacteria , so I can control the effect from vive .
Video : DM : I can fast the whole sequence the whole sequence inclinating the whole sequence by one side .
Video : And I 'll add the filter to the flower to expression more expression .
Video : DM : I can recombine the sequence .
So I don 't have to plan it first , but I can improvising it , and it 's longer or more cord .
And now , finally , I can move the whole sequence with the whole sequence inclining to the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new murdering men interface more and more more more more more more than our brain and body .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this patterns , and some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmitted is that it 's coming this new generation of project to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world as we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the hour to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writer .
I 'm to writing books is my profession , but it 's more than that ,
It 's also love and my love the fashine of my life .
And I don 't expect that I can change .
But , I said this , something particular happened in my life and my career , who brought me to remember the entire report to realibring the entire relationship to this work .
The particular thing is that I have recently written this book , this biography called Mangia , Prua , Ama , which , diversity , for some reason , for some reason to the world and become a big sensational , and became a big sensationship , became a lot .
And the result is that everywhere 's going to go , people treat me as if I was convicted .
It 's true -- condannated , condannated .
They are now worried and say , " Don 't have fear of the fear of you couldn 't do better ?
Do you don 't have to go to writing for all life without power to be able to create a book that can be able to create a book that can 't do somebody ? "
what can it important someone ? "
It 's rassure , you know .
But it could go worse , to that part of the 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a adolescent -- I was a adolescent -- I wanted to be a writer .
I went to meet the same reaction , by fear .
And people say , " Don 't the temes I didn 't have success ?
Don 't you fear that humiliation of the rifute you killed ?
Don 't you fear to do this forward for all life without the way that nothing is going to be out and die on a heart cumulate dreams with the feet of fallic fallic fallic fallic ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I 'm afraid of all of those things .
I 've had been fear .
And I also fear of many other things that people might not have to have .
As the algaxy and other things .
But , as I think about writing it , and I wonder , I was asking me , and I was asking me , why is it ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone has to expected to be spent by a work that you feel born to do .
But what is there so particular in the creative impress to make us nervous about health health health care about the mental health care about health and other people don 't do ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember one in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if it was afraid to be engineer ?
It was never -- that block of the engineer John , how do that ?
Do not work that , that 's that , right ?
Onestly , chemical engineers like group , they don 't certainly , in the chemical reputation of being alcost .
We have enough that writers , we have enough this reputation , and not just writers , we have this reputation of being enormous instable mentally .
And I 'm not going to look at the sad of the magnificent deaths of the magnificent minds , just in the 21st century , they died young and often for them .
And the ones that are not suicipate data seem to be real dissatisfidons .
Norman Mailer , before I die , before he die , he said , " Every my book was killed a little more . " A extraordinary affermation about work about the work of life .
But we don 't buy , when we heard these things , because we heard these things that somehow we 've completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering is in some way , and the art , at the end , at the end , at end , it 's going to be able to hard .
And the question I want to take all to everybody today is : I agree with this idea ?
It 's good for you , because also look at the same one centimeter , it 's not good for me for anything .
I think it 's hate .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encourage our great creative minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start to the feeling heard that suppose I 'm in my career .
That is , you know , you 're pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I 've got about 40 years .
I 've got yet about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely to be that any time I 'm going to be judated by the world as the work that was using after my last book .
I 'm going to be slavery , because we 're all more or less friends here -- is that my greatest success is my biggest .
Oh , Gesus , who thought .
You know this is the kind of thinking about a person thinking that leads to be a person to start run theless in the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep continue to continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question is , how ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflections , that the way to work to continue to write is to create a psychological courious , OK ?
I have to find a security distance of security between me , which I 'm written , and my natural reaction on which is going to be able to get . And as I was trying to all the scale of how to do it began to look through the time , trying to find other societies to see if they could have some other societies to see if they could have the best ideas and sane .
about how to help creative people to managing to managing inerent people to help creativity .
And that research me to ancient Great and ancient Rome .
Seguitem because it was a circle and then back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity was from men , OK ?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit about it divine and that was being being humans from someone who 's slightly distant and unknown .
The grew of creativity of these spirits of creativity .
Sococate , wonderful , it was credemand , it was a demon that elargives wisdom from the distances .
Romans were the same idea , but they called that spirit species of spirit .
which is great , because the Romans didn 't really think that a genius was not really someone who was particularly smart .
They think a genius was this kind of entities that had lived kind of divine death , in the middle of a study , a little bit like the elfter Dobby , and that was going to be out of the job of the artest and to model the outside of that work .
It 's a -- here , that 's the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological costruction that you protected from your work .
And they all knew that was so that it worked , right ?
So the anti-to-certain artists were protected by certain things , like , for example , right ?
If your work was exceptional , you couldn 't take all the goodds all the goodds , they knew that you were helped by this genius .
If your fallives , it wasn 't all your college , right ?
They all knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people han concepts in the West creativity in the West for a long time .
And then Renascisance came and everything changed , and this big idea ; we meet the human being in the center of the universe , and we meet and the misters and more and more and more and fleef space to the demers that write you from distraight .
This was the rational of humanity and people began to think that creativity was completely by ishared .
And for the first time in history , you begin to refer this or that artist as a rather than a genius as a rather than one person .
And I must tell you , I think it was a big herror .
I think that allow someone , one simple person to believe being like a recipient as the source , and the source of all my devices , creative , inosconciate and ethernal and ethernal is a responsibility to Africa 's a very big psychches to humans .
It 's like to ask someone to inguiate the sun .
It shape and it 's completely the ego and creates all these inextremendous inextactations on performance .
And I think it was this pressure to have this pressure to have artists in the past 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it is , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it fun ?
Maybe back to a more ancient comprehension of relationship between humans and mistery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't sell 500 years of rational thinking in a talk of 18 minutes .
And there is people between the audience that would sollevered suspected suspects on the notion of the notion of , you do people follow the slightly or hand-to-their projects .
I 'm probably not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I 'd like to take is -- why ?
Why not think that way ?
Because it 's more sense of everything that I 've ever heard to explain the exasperformance of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who I 've ever taken to do something -- so , basically , all of this -- it doesn 't really understand .
And , in fact , it can sometimes it seems to be completely paranormal .
I did this meeting cently with the extraordinary poetesse Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years old , but it was a poem for all life and told me that during his childhood in the Virginia , working out in the Virginia , and he was hearing it in the fields , and it was hearing .
He told me that was like a fragorous air track .
And that was rotles to be from the landscape .
He was heard of it was because he was so throw the land under his feet .
He knew I had one thing to do about that point and it was , words like a major . "
And so it was going to be clean and he was wouldn 't have to make something else that we can make a piece of paper and a match fairly and a match crowd and to sweet it and deal with it on the page .
Sometimes couldn 't fast be fastern enough , so that he was wild and run without able able to get into the home and poem the rotles was through and he would continue to rotles through the landscape , trying to be a round , trying to be a other poet .
And then there were those times -- this piece of time -- this piece , I would never forget -- there were moments where it was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running at home and he was trying to check and the poem was going through , and he was a hundred their hand and he said , that was as if you sleep with the other hand and and the stepply .
He was the poem from the tail and reput it in his body and transport to his body and transport on the page .
And in these cases , the poem was presented on the perfect page and it 's the last word at the first word .
So when I felt that -- it 's a crazy , it 's exactly equal to my creative process .
I 'm not not all my creative process -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a music , and my way to work is , and my way to work is ; you wake up at the same time every day and go and go and go and go on and go on and go on and go on and go on and go and go and go on and go and go to work and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and and go and and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go up and
But even I , in my head , I 've striped against that thing , at sometimes .
And I 'm image that many of you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , many of you , you know , you know , a lot of you , many of you , you know , you know , a lot of you , many of you , you know , you also have a lot of you , many of you , you know , many of you , you know , you know , a lot of you , many of you , han .
You know , even though the work and ideas came to me from a certain source , I could not honestly .
What is this thing ?
And how can we relationate to do it so that we don 't enjoy to lose the head , but , rather , that does it remakes us ?
So , as I 'm the best example of the best example of Tom Waits , which I 've interviewers , which I interviewed a different years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of the artist went back contemporary contemporary , trying to control , trying to control , to manage , to control these species of creative inhorized inhorized .
But then I invest , he got up , and one day as he was driving on a autostrada in Los Angeles , changed all for him .
He was going to fast quickly and all of a sent tract this little switch of melody , which was in his inspiration , and the wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and the desider , but it 's not as a wonderful , and it 's not as to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a matit , it doesn 't have a matter .
So he begins to hear this kind of old anxiety is growing in him , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to obsessed by this song lower .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , I was stopped .
I 'm going to make the entire process and he did something completely new .
I 'm just looking at the sky and he said , " Scuses , don 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" You know , " Is it the song ?
If you really want to exist , back to a more opporter when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you go to important someone else today .
You 're going to disturban Leonard Cohen . "
And his work process , he was changed after this .
I don 't work , the work was still dark like .
But the process , and the fish was that was required when the genius was re-hed when the genius , the genius out of the problems and flipped it back to where it was , by remainly , and he was doing it from , he was doing that it didn 't have a interified thing and returned .
but it was beculiar this peculiar pattern , wonderful bularre a conversation between Tom and this strange and this strange and this strange that allowed was not Tom .
So how much I feel that story started changing a little bit of the way I worked in and already saved me once .
This idea , I save me when I was writing " Mangia , Prega , Ama , and I advanced in one of those cave disperation where we all work on something and we can 't start to think that it 's going to be a disaster , which is going to be a disaster , which is going to be the book .
Not just bad , right the worst book .
And I started thinking about gains this project .
But then I reminded to Tom who was talking about the air and I tried to do it .
So , I got my face in the handard and I realized my common to a vacuum of the room .
And I said to high , " You know , what , you 're going to think if this book is not going to be brilliant , not be interactly college , right ?
Because as you see , I 'm paying all I have , I don 't have more than that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to present you and make your part .
Okay . But if you don 't do it , I don 't know what it .
I 'm going to write the same because it is my work .
And I 'd like to be recorded that I 'm presented to do my part of this is , because -- at the end is so , OK -- secos ago , it 's so -- secos ago in the deserts of Africa people were south to the clear of the middances and music and musical acred to go on hours and hours .
And they were always magnificent , because the balleras were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every once , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists was actually transendent .
And I know that you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you 've all seen , at a certain point , a performance like .
It was like the time stopped , and the ballery , and the ballery through a kind of bral bral and nothing about it , as the 1,000 before , but all of the time , it was trined .
And suddenly , it doesn 't appeared as a human .
But it turned out from the divinity and under the fire in the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , at the time , the people knew what was called it with his name .
They were their hands and began to cancer , " Allah , Allah , God .
That is God , you know .
Curious known -- when Ms invading the south of Spain , preserved this habitude with their and pronounce changed in the cheating from " Allah , Allah , the role , Allah , the role , " which you can hear in the runds or flamer .
In Spain , when a artist has done something that impossible and magic , " Allah , the words , words , I was , " Big , magnific , " I 'm going to understand , " I 'm going to go -- a God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But the problem is comes the day after the dancing dancing , when you wake up and discover that are the 11 of Martedyes and discover that are the day day morning of God is there .
It 's just a mortal with a mortal gran mal lots , and maybe it 's never going to get to that altitude .
And maybe anybody can be the name of God again as it goes , and what is to do with his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful recilions of the most painful recognization .
But maybe it has to be so angot-force , if you can 't believe , indeed , the most extraordinary aspects of your being being from yourself .
But it was just that you 'd think they 're very prested from a inimaginable source of this squisite part of your life that you have to have to someone else .
And , you know , if we think it all changes .
And so I started thinking about , and it 's certainly like this , and it 's certainly like this , I was working on the book that I would publishing soon , and dangerous , and oddangerous , followed , and it 's just followed to be in my great success .
And what I have to continue to say when I feel elected by this is , not having .
You don 't go . It 's just your work . It 's just your work .
Continua present-inhert for your part , any way , whatever ,
If your work is dancing , bad .
If the devine , absurd genius to do decide to let me go down some kind of wonderful , for one moment through your efforts , then you go , " On it . "
Otherwise , you do the same your dance .
" Ole ! " Oh , " Oh , you know , you know .
I think about it , and I think I 'm going to teach it .
" Ole ! " at yourself , I just for himself , I had had a huge and head tals to make you continuous .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And as you know , I 've talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean and discovery of new genes .
Now we 're starting a new path . We started digitalize biology and now now to go into the biology and now we 're entering in a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We 've always been trying to bring big questions .
" What is life ? " is something that many biological biologists , I think they have tried to understand vary lifting .
We tried different approaches , reducending the minimum of terms .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to move from the analogical world of biology to the digital world .
Now we 're asking : can we regenerate life , or new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest genome that can autome in lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create one more more smaller .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of the way of the 500 that I 'm here .
But when we give a look at its metabolic map , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes we can eliminate , one at a time , is very improbable that this can bring a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to progrew was synthesize this cromosom in a way to make modify components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " Can we synthesize a cromosom ? "
What can we have the chemical to produce these big molecules that we never have been able to create before ?
And , in case , can we make a cromosom , can make a cromosom ?
A cromosoma is just a chemical piece of chemical material .
The speed that we 're able to digitalize life is growing to exponential exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , rather procreates rather slowly , but it 's improving .
And our more recent results to a exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process is require a lot of pass , beginning with a bioethical review before we began .
But we found that that synthesize that is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines of machines of DNA , the wild of 30 to 50 letters and it 's a degenerative process : more the segment is longer , the segment is more than the segment is , more herrors .
So we had to develop a new method to assembly these fragments and correct the errors .
And this was our first attempt , to start digital information from the genome of Phi X 174 .
It 's a little batters that kills kills .
We designed the fragments , actually , the correction of errors and had a molecule of DNA , about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this chemical piece of chemical material and we put it into the bacteria , the bacteria have started reading this gene and product the viral particles .
The viral particles have been required by the cells , are back and they 're back and destroyed the cell .
I 've been talking about recent with membrals of the oil industry say that they have certainly compressed this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where software can actually actually build his hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in the bigger .
We wanted to build the entire chromosom of the bacterium .
It 's more than 580 miles of genetic code .
So we thought we 'd build it in a seven of the virus of the size of virus , so that we could change the cassettes to understand what they are the living of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard accurately was a mile for every 10 miles .
We discovered , 30 herrors . If we had that original sequence . If we used that original sequence we never had been able to work .
One part of the process is to design segments that are over 50 letters that are overraphic segments with all other people in 50 letters to make a little bit more small inside that works together .
We try to give them one unique here .
You probably have read that we put a lot of floor .
Think of it so : we have a genetic code on four letters : A , G and T.
Three of those letters together with the codifying about 20 lots , and there is a specific order to each lots of them .
So we can use gene code to write words , framework , framework , framework ,
What we did about the beginning was autograped to do .
Some of them were deliver from the fact that it was not poem .
We designed these segments to just to join them to just join them .
There are them and put them together and put them together .
And we started assembled to assembled with segments from five to segments from five to seven miles to segments of 24 miles reading to be a segments of 24 miles letters .
We have these sequence segments in abundance so that we can get them to sequence these squence , so we 're trying to create a very very robustood -- as you see in a minute .
We 're looking for authomatize the process .
So , this looks like the tabellon a basket .
When we get to these very long segments very long , more than 100 miles , more than 100 miles , they don 't grow more directly in the E.
You go to the modern limit of the modern limits of the molecular biology .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination recombination , which is using biology to repurpose DNA can bring the DNA can bring the segments .
Here 's one example .
This organism , called Deinocockohard radioduring three million rad .
You can see in the suddenly requarters like its chromosom .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly how it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely .
They can live under a vacuum .
They 're absolutely certainly , that life exists in space , and you could find new environments of water .
Actually , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we 've built these processes , by simply using the evidence of segments to insert .
The evidence is assemble .
This image was not taken with a microscope with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a lot of a lot of this big molecule that we can see it with a read .
These are pictures that they cover a six period of about six seconds .
This is the advertising we did a little time ago .
It 's more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the biggest molecule of a definitely defined structure .
It has a weight of 300 million .
If we stay with a 10 without 10 without spaces , you would like 142 pages , it would just take 142 pages to transform this gene code .
Now , how do we do it work ? How do we activity ?
Of course , you know , a virus is a game from kids .
It 's a bit more complicated when they 're using bacteria .
It 's easier , even when it 's biggest ekariote as our : you can just extract the nucleus and put another , which is practically the cloning process .
In the archaea , the chromosom is instead of integrated inside to the cell , but we have recently demonstrated that we are able to make a transplant transplant of a cell to another and activity .
We can get a cromosom from a microbial species .
The two are different than men from the topi .
We 've added some gene in a more way that I could decide what choose for this chromosom .
And then slave it with the ends in a way to kill all proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was stuit -- and you know our sophisticatoms -- the new cromosom was going into the cell .
And we thought we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to spingering us in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that many species have added species have added a second or a third romosom from some part , added in a thousands of new tracks to that species .
So who think about evolution as a gene as a gene as a modified with a lot of biology .
It 's the ones called " restription of restription that they 're digerisn 't going to be digerising .
The cromosom that was in the cells don 't have one .
cell cell phone that we put it .
It 's expressed , and recognized the other chromosom as expressed material , and we were returned with only the cell and the new cell ccell cell and the new cell ccell .
it blue because of the genes of genes we put .
And in a short lass of time , all the characteristics of a species , and it turned out of all the way , and it turned out to the new species , based on the new software that we put in the cell .
All proteins are changed , the members are changed , and when we read the genetic code exactly to what we 've been transfer to what we 've been transfer .
Now , this might seem alchemy genetic , but it 's software , but it 's software enough to a lot of things .
Now , I 've already explained that here is not talking about genesis -- but progress to this from three million years and a half years of evolution , and I 've said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion .
Why do that ?
I think it 's obvious when we think about our necessity .
We 're going to spend from six billion and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right for example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each one existing in 1946 , 40 years , there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicinals and walks for six billion and a half billion people .
It 's more dying to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion baries of coal baries .
That means percent million baries a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to reduce them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to hold all the whole emission of CO2 from these materials that floor of these materials that 's going to the atmosphere .
And today , thank you to scientific discovery of the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they are the designed for the future .
The electronics of electronics is just a dozen about components , and think about how many different things came out .
Our limits here are basically by biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have the techniques , thank you to these rapids of synthesization , that we call combinatory genomics .
We 're able to build a big robots that can produce a big robots that can produce a million cromosomes a day .
Think about this 20 million genes or different genes or to try to get the processes to make either either either either or drugs , and new vaccines , and we can change , and to create more biology , and create more biology that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for a chance of survival , production of chemical or or fuel , production of etc .
This is an instantaneous instantaneous instantaneous program that we 're working to be able to be to to be able to to be able to to make species on the computer .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly what the genetic code .
We 're now focused on fuel of quarters .
You 've also seen that , you know , from the grate was a lot of bad experiment .
We have fuels of second and third generation that will be enough to sugar to the sugar fuels than the either value or different types of butanol .
But the only way the biology can have a lot of a lot of impact without increase more impact the cost of food and limitar the cost of the food and limited the availability to be able to transform CO2 in matter , so we 're working on the cells that can achieve this purpose , and we think we could have the first carbon diogeneration in about 18 months .
The solar light sunlight with CO2 is a metodoctor -- but in our discoveries all over the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deept-deep-feet deeption , about 2500 feet of the water .
They 're metane they 're using a molecular hydrogen molecular as energy .
We 're trying to understand if we can figure out CO2 , which can be easily transmitted by the way , converted that CO2 in fuel , to drive that CO2 in the fuel , to drive this process .
So , we think we could be able to increase what we could increase what the basic question of what is , " which is life is Nice , vercomparison , we have the goal of the whole industry .
Yeah . If you don 't do it from TED , where can you do it ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And also , we 're working to use the same methods to create vaccines .
You 've seen this year with the influence , we 're always back of one year and a dollar in less when it 's a dollar in less ,
I think that what you can change building fought vaccines in a lot of an ancient .
Here 's how the future could start to look at changing , and now , the tree of evolution , accelating the evolution with bacteria synthesize , and finally finally , and finally finally eucariote .
We 're so so from the best people .
Our purpose is to be a long time to live long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'm going to show you , the most quickly possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we 've taken to Microsoft , in the way , and it 's Seadragon .
It 's a environment that you can interact is to local level that you can interact with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of digital gabytells of digital photograph and continuous fast for a fast switch , disponing , disponing the images how we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big amount of information that we see , how big these are collected or the images of data or the images .
Most of the ones are common photographs , but this is a slide from the Biooeca of Congress , and reached in the three-migapixel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that limits of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen on your screening in any time . It 's a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not not with the data .
This is the Casa desolate of Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
To show you that it 's about textboard and not of images , we can do something like that , to really make something like that , to make a real representation of the textbook , not a picture of the textbook , not a picture .
It could be a way a little artificial to read a book electronic book .
I don 't have advice .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of The Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and beautiful experience of paper of a magazine , or a quotidian , which is for nature , which is for nature a lot of half .
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of the Guardian .
We created a higher advertising .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see them here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that that means to put up to the end of the pop-up and other symbounds , I don 't need to be necessary .
Of course , the map is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if I don 't say we have contributes to this camp .
These are all the streets in the United States .
So , we go to something else .
This is now actually alive from the web ; you can go to the web .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research an interesting research computer in fact , a student of Washington , with Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Seitz of U.S. .
And it 's from the web , gested by Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of pattern , where we can go from one image to a picture and have this kind of experience to multiple .
But the spaction of the pictures here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization of computers have registered these images together , so that they correspond to the real place in real place that the image -- all scared by the Lagen 's fashion Montagne Roccious saves -- are been taken . So , you see elements of a light-flightenesious imaging panic , and these things are all accomplished to the space .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more spaces .
I want to go directly to one of the original data of Noahhhimself from a prototype of Photosynthhotosynth that we have done for the first time the scorce extremely scorce -- to show you what I think is the key behind this technology , the Photosymptotype . And it 's not necessarily evident .
We had to worry about legal aspects and forward .
This is a reconstruction of the catthedral of Notre of Dame pictures from Flickr . Baast digitar , and you get images of types in the magicians , other people in the magicions , and so I 'm going to say , and I say , " You know , one of these arancions represented a picture of this .
So , they 're all pictures taking Flickr and they were all lined to the space space level in this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this way simple .
You know , I would never have thought I 'm going to end up working for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying this kind of accountioning .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different types of different types of square of different switch . And then , in fact , it 's a meaning number , must , in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try to try those strange .
A lot of them are block , etc .
And somewhere here is a series of photographs -- here it is .
This is a poster of Notre Dame recorrectly .
We can move from the poster to the vision of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do with social environment . This is now taking data from the entire memory -- from the entire college of the entire spot , from visual view -- and releases all of those data together together .
All those pictures become lined , more than the som of the parts of the som of the parts .
You have a model of the land interest that .
Think about this as a prolungment of Stephen Lawler on the War 's work .
It 's something that growing in complexity as people are using it , and the people are using it , and the vantages for people to increase with use .
Their pictures are smart with lots of people .
If someone is the idea of the idea of those sants say , my name pictures , my photograph of Notre of Dame suddenly , you know , and I can use it as a kind of involved in this space , and I can use it in that space , in that metaphimself , using the universe , using the photograph experience of cross-moot-red experience of a cross-mobile cross-mooth .
Of course , a consequence of all this is virtual models of all interesting , and they 're not just going to be able to be seen and satellitaries and satellitarian images and satellitarian images and satellitery .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software is that you 're going to do is that a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs , all the photographs , everyone in the entire world will be related together ?
AA : Yeah . What 's doing is actually discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the basis in the content of the images .
What is a very interesting if you think about require security of semantic information that a lot of these images are possible .
As you do a research of images on the web , you digits a sentence and the text on the website , and the textbook on the webspot of pictures .
Now , what if that is that is the picture of all your pictures ?
So the amount of semantic interconnection and the amount of reception and the amount of wealth that is really huge . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible . It 's really incredible .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the major pleass when you travels and one of the delicies of the ethnographic research is the power of living between those who didn 't forget the anti-traditions , the past in the wind , the touches in the rain , the vigets of the rained plant .
And the thinking that sciamounans are travel over the Via Lattea , or that the Inuit is still a lot of meanings , or that the Inuit is still a sense of meaningful , or in Himalayas the deaths of Dharma , to remember the major of the major eventually , and that the idea that the world that we live in there is not a sense , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set set set of choices that our strops has done , very well or a lot of generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
We all hire . All procrease .
We are suggests of beginning .
We need to deal with the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprising and whallize --
We all have art .
What it hits is the particular rhythm of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they 're the Penan of the forest Borneo , or the following of Haiti , or the jacks of the Haiti , or the Kenya settlements of Kenya settlements in the heart of the Ande , or a cammouth in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak of the Qomolangma , on the Everest , the mother of the world .
All of these people teaching us that there are other ways of exists of some other ways of thinking , other ways of music in the world .
And , if you think , you 're a second , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
Insized , with the world 's cultures of the world 's cultures of the world 's spiritual life and cultural and cultural life that has flies the planet as the planet as the biological ragela as a biological ragela .
And you can think about this ragnature as a cultural ethnosmoke , and you can define ethnosphere , the total nosphere , dreams , mitted , dreams , ideas , inspiring , inspiring , inspiration ,
The ethnosphere is the patriage of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in as a species .
And because biosphere was free consumed by the way , as a further has happened to ethnosfurther and purpounds much more .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species was or is on the hort of simply , because it 's false , because it 's falmost apocalypocalypothesis -- and I don 't even close to the most optimistic diversity -- and you don 't even even have close to the most optimistic diversity .
The index of all that is , of course , the language .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not just by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
One language is the pattern of human spirit .
It 's the middle of which animal of every culture is in the material world .
Every language is a forest of mind , a backin , a spiritual chance .
And of those 6,000 languages , while we 're sitting in Monterey , at least half of those 60s .
They don 't come to teach children , which means that it means , unless than wasn 't going to be in .
What is more sad than being the silence , the last few sad to be the last few to talk to a language , not to have a language of wisdom or to ancient promise the children ?
This is a hard of someone in the world every two weeks , every two weeks , one weeks , one elderly dying with the switches in the last last syllabe of a ancient language .
And I know somebody say , " Isn 't that that ?
The world would be a better place if we 're going to talk all the same language ? " Well , then we talk to all yoruba . We talk about switch .
Let 's talk about kogs .
You 'll cover a tract of a thing that means not to talk about your language .
Today I 'd like to do a journey through the ethnosphere --
a little journey in the ethnosfetnosh of what we 're losing .
A lot of us forget that when I say , " different ways of existing truly different ways of existing .
Let 's take for example , this Barasana books , in Amazon settle-wild board , which creds at the midddle of the switches of the slatte of the swalking slatte in the swalking sunt .
It 's a popular that is not able to distinguish the blue color from the green because it 's time to the celests is identified in the forest , which is the people 's popular .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial language , detailable , " you have to move a different person . You have to talk about different language .
All of this has radical in the past , yet the particularity is that in these families that are talking about six or seven language because of marriage sees of myself , no one language .
They 're limited to listen to listen to talk .
Let 's take one of the most interesting tribes that I 've lived , the Waorani Eastern Ecuador a population , a incredible population that has had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have tried a commercial contact .
They did it write from the high photographed them in a few who were popular , forget that this population of the forest pluvial forest .
They 've been collected the pictures , they turned to the research of a shape and , not found nothing , they have concluded that it was that was a dealing with the lance .
But the Waorani killed only killed the strange .
They killed between them .
54 percent of mortality was caused by themselves .
We 're eight generations and we found two cases of death and found two cases of death and when we were injected to know , they have a lot of them aging , and then they killed it . And then they killed it the same .
The cters were able to recognize the urina animal from 40 steps and to recognize the species .
In the early 1980s , I was assigned a very interesting task when my professor of Harvard , asked me if I wanted to go to Harvard to intruly intruly the base of Duvalier and Tontonton Macoutes , and impossessing in Macoutes , and impossessing me in order to make the zombiombic .
To make sense of miraculous , I 'd had to understand the Vodoun culture and that Vodoun 't magic .
It 's pretty fairly of a complex metaphysical vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to say , the great religions of the world , what would say ?
Cristianism , Islam , Buddddism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has not been religious lifetian . And instead of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts .
What makes the voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , you know , the spirits are born .
The spirits can be invited by Great Acqua , they respond to the dance of dance and they replace at temporary the soul of the vive way that for a brief across the goal .
So , for this voodooists love to say , " You know , white , you know , God .
We say in the temple and divention .
And from the moment you 're , is the spirit that you 're going to drive you , how can do you be in the bad ?
So you 're looking at these incredible events : following voodoo in the state of trance that touch dying unfuocated a demonstration rather than the body in the body of mind on the body when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme , when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme .
Of all the people who have lived the most extraordinary people are the Kogi of Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta , in the Colombia sector .
It 's ancivilization of the tyranna civilization that once were living on the characters of Colombia in attention to the conquister massive players was on the mainering plug .
In a mackicked continent switched , this popular popular , this was never conquitation by the spages .
And now , they have governed by a clero , but their formation is very extraordinary .
The young people are being brought by the families to three or four years , and they live in a good world and secreged in a world made of good stone and hundred stone of the ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , I 'm going to reproduce the nine months of gestation that spent in the user of the mother , are metaphorically in the user of Great Mother .
For this time , they 're acculturated to values of their societies , values that they predict and only their predict and their precious prayers -- or to say the cost ecological ecological .
At terminal the earth of this incredible beginning , are improviously taken out and for the first time in 18 years , they see a high . And in that account of the first cut , when the sun of the beautiful landscape , when the sun of beautiful landscape , all the way beautiful behind , all of the splendor . The precise is behind of this incredible indge , and says ,
" Vison ? I 'm like I said .
It 's amazing . Now is you protect it . "
It 's called the major brothers and say that we , brothers , we 're the colpitches , we are the colpath of the world .
This is a level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about ingene populations and environment we think about the Rseau and old history of the noble self-vage , which is a razy razy in his simplicity or maybe Thoreau and say that we say that these populations are closer to the Earth .
The populations are not feels or not feels from nor indebuld .
There is no space for these things in the malaries of Aststopped or winds of the Tibet , but because of the time and the riters , they created a mistic of the Earth 's Earth 's based on a bottom of the Earth , but on a much more such such as well as well as a very well , because it 's infection is because it 's infection is .
What does it mean ?
That means that a boy of Ande who growing Ande who growing the mountain , and it 's a spirit that the mountain is a human destiny , and it 's going to be a different relationship with the mountain or that place to be a different relationship to a mung of Montana and a boy , and it 's a fun , and it 's a mury of rock , and it 's a murther than being scratch of Montana , and it 's going to be screwind to be .
Whether it 's the hour of one spirit or a mineral was irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that define is the metaphor , and the natural world .
I grew up in the forest of the Columbia Britannica credating that forests served that forests served to be cut .
What has made me a human being from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that forests are the forests of Hukuk and the beak stories of Hukukuk and the spirits of paradise and the dog dog wners who live on the extreme , and beyond the world , spirits that they 're dealing with Hukukukuk and the stories of the world , and the wakid .
If you start to look at these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of their sensational discoveries . We take this plant .
I 've been taken this to open in the northirdly Amazon .
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayahuasca , the most powerful practical repertorium of sciamanic repertoilet .
What makes the layer macological layahuash is not the farmacological potential of the substance , but its elaboration . It 's composed by two elements .
From a hand , this lethnosis that is a series of rather racarboline , harmine and harmers and harmine , slightly hucinogenes .
I mean the only plant is a plant is a blue smoke that alters a little bit the consciousness , but it 's michoices with a leaves of family said Psychotridis said .
This plant contains sad powerful , very similar switch , very similar to serotonin the sypamine-methoxypamine-methoxypamines .
If you ever see Yanomami , you know , you know , the nose of the nass that make a different set of species , extent methoxylyptamine .
And I 'm going to be in the nose is a little bit like being disappeared by a sweet square burning by and landing on a sea of electricity . Risate it . It 's a destortion of reality .
I often I often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who was psychedelic was , with his discovery of fungi in the 1930 in Mexico .
I 'm going to do my thesis , you can 't classify these triployed as hallucinogists because if you 're not told anybody to be hallucinated . And triptamines can 't be hort because they 're money from a supply because they are money from a supply in in the intestine , detailed .
It 's possible to absumerely if you just to have them with other chemicals that denately money in MAO .
Now , it 's beautiful : Poline carboline that are inhibitors of MAOs , the same kind of the same kind of need to be able to be able to a tripamine . The question is , smile source -- in a 80,000 species of plants , how these popular popular spopular , which is such a version of biochemical , which is such a version of parts of parts of parts of the parts of parts ?
We use the great euit of proof the proof and error , which can be infruit .
But if you ask Indians , they 're going to say , " The plants are talking about . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuash , which is distingue , and that our eyes would be going to be in the same species .
If we ask them how they are they 're going to stbilish tasonomy , they 'll tell us , " I thought of plants , I don 't know that ? "
The solution is : you take the 17 varieties in a night of lunder a moon and each night with a different .
With this is not sleep to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that contact .
Now , [ it ] the problem is that even those of us who have to heart people who have heart people are pathoreses , but somehow reduced to the margins of history in the world , and it 's going to be .
In fact , the 19th century , between 300 years , it 's not reminded for its own innovations , but rather than the innovations , but rather as the era that we stopped and we have huntered and we have abbringing activity of biological diversity of biological diversity of biological diversity . Now , the problem is not the change .
All cultures through the secoli have been involved in a dance for new life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians have no stopped to be Sioux when they put out of the arc and fits as well as American have no stopped to be American have been American have been American have been when they 're part of American have been American people who stopped by the way and cales .
It 's not the change or the technology that integrity . It 's the power .
The during flight of domination .
And if you give a look at the world , you 'll find that these are not cultures of these are not cultures .
They are living creatures and dynamics spint out of identify that they go beyond their ability to adaptation .
Which is that it 's disboscening in the patria of the Penan --
a popular no-made of Sarak , in the souest , a popular popular who lived free in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to the service and prostitution on the rives of the rivers , where you can see the river the river referenced by lifests , and the navi wills , where the navels of the navels ,
You can fit to fit , the statement of the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that are come with the discovery of the golden .
If we were on the mountains of the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard of political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physical extinction of a popular , is condanned to universal level , but the ethnocide , the destruction of the lifestyle of life , not just is condanned , but it 's a strategy , because it 's it 's a strategy of development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet of the Tibet until you 're not part of the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China , in the Western Cina through the Tibet , from the Tibet , and by a young link , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what the statistics is that we hear about .
6,000 sacres sacres sacres in chickens and further .
1.2 million people killed by military military during the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was abcritical to the Panchen Lama .
which means it was killed to killed to the template of Chinese invasion .
His , it was smoke with Sua Santity during the diaspora who brought the popular in Nepal .
His mother been impressed and her colcollege was to be rich .
It was brought to hidden towards two years old hidden under his gonna because it would not live without him to live without him .
The sister , which has done the same , was in reducation camp .
One day has been walked up a fasm a fasm rat Mao and , for this transgression , was mitted to the works for seven years .
The pain of Tibet can be insometimes , but the reinside of the people 's population is from the population .
And then , all you reduce it to a choice .
We want to live in the world of the monotony or the world , or we want to acght the polymicromate world of diversity ?
The great anthropology Margaret Mead , before I die was told her her biggest fear was that , in our go to this vision of the world , we 're going to see the whole gamm of human imagination , but one day we 'll think about it from a limited of the human imagination , but one day , even as we 'll get from a sleep from a sleep .
And it 's humiliating our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Neolitical Revolution , who has gone agriculture , which made us suck to the seed of the seed of the seed , to replace the sler of the skie , creating the gerarchy of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has been 300 years .
That squals a story not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we 're going to deal with the millennia that we 're going to get .
When these miric miric miriades of the world is asked what it means to be human , respect with 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all all risky the chance to be what we are : a kind of conscious , which is to make all the people and all the gardins can transport . And there are great moments of optimism .
I 've been taken this picture on the extremity of Baffin , when I went to hunt hunt with Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The canady was not always gentle with the Inuusees and in the 1950s to stand in the 1950s to stand in the 1950s , we have rinchiused them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refused to go .
The family , I was told for his life , and took him all the arms , and all his attitude .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't have cold , they 're not cold ,
The slexes in origin were made of fish , were made of heavy of the slems .
The grandfather of this man didn 't intimise from the artica or or the library that was suffering .
It 's gathered away , it 's calculated the pantalons in foca and defected in your hand . When the did I have been congelated , and they did it , and they 've been congelated ,
He spred on the door of this caccept of this caccailed and when I became solid , he killed a dog .
He wasn 't choices and created a bridle , with the cash cash of the house has created one of the sleth-dog , and it 's disappeared on the banker ,
We want to talk about cavarsely with nothing ? [ Rism ] and this , in different ways , [ Apaushi is the symbbol of the Inulience of the world 's resilience of the world .
In the 1999 , 1999 government canaw , the total control of a bigger area of territory area of the bigger of California and Texas mitting together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's an independent territory . They were all the mineraries .
One splends of how a nation-state could remember with his popular .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious to the one of us was in these remote zones of the planet , remote that are not remote remote .
For someone is house .
They represent human sections of the human imagination that are hard to the dawn of the templates . And for us all , like the dreams of our children , becomes part of the geography of the hope of the hope .
Finally , we have National Geographic we are convinced that politicians will never get nothing .
We believe that polemiics --
[ Applauses ] don 't they lost , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the world , and maybe we are the best institution of the world . Every month 35 million visitors . Every our website . Every site , our website . Every swebsite .
156 countries transmit our television canal canal .
Our revided by millions of people .
Our work is traveling in the ethnosphere to bring our audience in a wonderful cultural world
where the wisdom of all the people can contributing to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some of some things I written in this book that I hope you 've heard and proverse to evidence some links , in case , I don 't notice them .
I 'd like to start with what I call " the dogma official . "
The dogma official dogma official dogma .
The dogma official dogma dogma societies . The dogma official dogma is official dogma : " If you want to massimilar the citizens . "
The reason is , from a side , in fact that freedom is in a value , it 's precious , useful , , essential for humans .
On the other is that if we 're free , each of us can act for all that massimilar to do everything that massimilar our well-being , without any decided in the name .
The way to massimilar to freedom is massimilar the choice .
More choices , the more choices , more are flies , and more is their freedom , is their greatest .
This , I think , it 's so deeply radical in the society that nobody would dream to put it in doubt .
And it 's also deeply radical in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress you can .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I 'm going to make a simple note about condition .
In my supermarket , there are 175 condments , without 10 varieties of oil and 12 acestravel and 12 acks and 12 acks , and 12 acks , and 12 acks of the huge of condition in the winners that nobody of the 175 , already ready ready to your degree .
Here is what supermarket .
And then you go to the electronics store to buy a stereo stereo : CD , lector , radio , radio , plag , radio , plag , radio , the printer .
And in this single negotid of electronics , there 's a big number of components .
We can make six million and a half of different combinations using the components that there are only one store .
You need to admit that there is a lot choice .
Other travels : the world of communications .
Once I was a child , you could get all the phone services of the phones that were provided by must a mom Bell .
It was wasn 't bought .
One consequence of that , between the phone was that the telephone was never going to break .
These templates .
Now we have a variety of telephones , especially between the cell phones .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is the middle , MP3 , cut of the nose , and foreign crowd to the burning burning .
If you don 't see it in the store in the store , you 're going to get you to .
And what it turns out that , is people enters in the negoties and ago this question . And you know , you know , the answer ? The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't make any things .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the aquends , is the same explosion of choices .
Assistency sanitarian : It 's not going on in the United States and doctor , you know what you have to do .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and doctor says , " Okay , we could do A , or B , or B , " A has these benefits and these srisks , " Be has these benefits and these risks . What do you want to do ? "
You know , you know , " Dotter , what I should do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these benefits and these benefits and these benefits . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you can rebad , " Dotter if she was me , what would do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not like . "
The result of the result of the mality , expression that it makes it seem to look like a beautiful thing .
But it 's actually not that a move the weight and responsibility to make decisions from someone knows something , which is about doctor , to someone else -- and then it 's not really sick -- and so it 's not in the ideal condition to make real decisions of true .
There 's a huge marketing of drugs , drugs to people like me and you , that if you think about it doesn 't have any sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do they say ?
The answer is that they want to doctor , we call the doctor for asking them to make us recipe .
Something about this fundamental as is our identity is a question of choice , how you see in this vision . " We don 't want to force children . We don 't want to force children . They 're not going to make the right time .
And we can reinventing how many times you aggrath .
which means that every morning , at the morning , you have to decide that kind of person wants to be .
I 'm spect to the family and marriage , a common perspective time , sunged almost for anyone , was that was that was that was that was more soon as possible , and he was beginning to make the earlier possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not even when , and not even what to do .
And day , all , all is really to play .
I teach very smart students , and I 'm 20 percent of work than a time .
And not because they 're less brilligent , because it 's less diligent .
but why are I impensierites , I 'm going to ask , " I should I wish or not ? I should I do it now ? "
" I should say , I would think before ? I have to think before or the career ? "
They 're interrogatives .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even though this implies not completely to do the tasks and I don 't get a good vote to my exercise .
And they have to do it . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're fortunate , like Carl , because the technology allows us to work every day , every day , every day , every single day , every single day , from the Hotel Randolds older .
And in parently , there 's a corangle , and I don 't tell you , where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work ? That 's continually decided , if we have to go , continually decided , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our child playing , with the cell cell phone in a cell , the Blackberry in the other , and the nothing , and the notebook , the notebook , and the notebook , and the notion .
And even though they are all spent , every minute minute that we see our child rotate , we 're also asking the game , " I have to answer this call ? "
" I have to answer this email ? I have to absolute this letter ? "
And even when the answer is , " no , all this makes the experience of your child , very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the things , and big things , and big things , materials and life , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Obs , there were some possibilities , but not all was a question of choice .
The world today is it looks like this : The dilemma is , " Is it a good thing , or negative ? "
The answer is , it 's Sholding .
The slightly slightly , so I 'm going to talk about the negative ones .
All this choice , two negative effects of these things .
The first one , paradoxally , is that produces instead of liberation .
With the options of floor of choose , becomes very difficult to do .
I give you a meaning example : a study study conducted on fairly .
A colleagues had access to the Vanheald data , the gigantic funds , with about a million clients of funds , with about a million clients of implots of money in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the lower than two percent .
With 50 source source , there is 10 percent in less than adesions than adesions as they are available . Why ?
Because with 50 sours of the flows , is maledicely difficult to decide , and choice is remaintain the inept .
And at questions , and again , questions , questions , and of course , questions , and of course , I 'm never going to ask .
You know that it doesn 't mean the workers are going to mangering food for canoes because they don 't have enough money , it means that the decision is so hating the decision is so hating the funds of complementary the funds of the work .
Not participating , they 're losing to five dollars for year from the work , which would be well as a worker , and it would be well disposed to true .
So , the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world like this .
" And finish , for ethernity : ketchup , senaps or or maionese ? "
You want to take the right decision , if it 's for the right decision , right ?
You don 't want to choose the source sat , and even the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoid paralysis and do a choice , and we 're not satisfacts from the result of how we would be we have to have to be with less options of how we would be had to do .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many condent condent of them , if you buy one and it 's not perfect , it 's not perfect , it 's not perfect , you could make a different choice that would be better . And what 's going on is that the alternative imagined us industry , and the report removed the decision by the decision to sfy the switnessing is to reduce the decision ,
And even when it was a good decision .
More choices , there are , more is easy to dispilefy than any detail that 's insod-.
And also , there is what economists call constery opportunity .
Dan Gilbert asked very well as a lot of stammed as the value we 're going to do with .
In the rest , when there are a lot of possible options , it 's easy to represent the characternative characternative , and be less satisfacts of the option that is choice .
Here 's an example . I school with all those who are not New York .
But that 's what you probably think about .
There is this cople to the Hamptons .
a place of luser .
It 's becoming . Ottim . Ottim days . It 's all for them .
Not nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , malth , it 's Augofts . "
" All my neighbors to Manhattan is . "
" I could talk to their front to the front of home . "
And it 's pass two weeks , and it 's losing -- the chance of parking -- the chance of parking things where it wants .
The constery opportunity is decrease for what we have , even when choice was an excellent .
And more are the options we have to think , more the characteristics actions are going to be against how expensive opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This vision tells us a lot of things .
It 's about living the moment , and maybe of living slowly .
But the most important point is that any of you choose , you choose to do , you know , you know , not do other .
The things that we don 't choose are many active attractive attractive what we do .
Thirst point : it 's growing about the expectations .
I tried it on my skin beating a new jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were only like , they buy them and wild vestivestivestivan , were dissimulate , and they were caught a lot of times , and they were going to go well .
So , I went to buy a new when those old old old old old old those were went , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The commit said , " You want to want to slim fits , fit , fit ? "
Do you want to want to the cernight ? " Stonewashed , " or " ached , " or " swashed ?
" Do you want them to be strapped ? "
" You otto want them to want to take off off . Bass the blaw , " Continured .
I was sitting , and after a little bit , and after a little bit , I could say , " I want the kind of -- that was the only kind of , " I don 't have any idea what it was , so for a hour jeans , and then I went out of the jeans , and with the best pair of jeans that I had ever .
It was the massive . I had the whole choice . I had the best .
But I felt .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was going to be worse is that with all of the aspectop-aspectations were altic , jeans had to be perfect .
I began to expectations . I didn 't expected anything about exceptional existed when it was one kind of a kind , but when I saw 100 different , and I was like 100 different .
What I was bought , but I didn 't perfect .
After I had compared that choice with what I was trying to do with what I was trying to be insatisfied .
The addition of options in life of people do not make that increase expeccellence than the options of the same .
And this is going to produce less satisfy , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing if you realize it .
Because if they knew , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more like this .
" You were better when he was worse . " The reason you were better when he was worse was better when he was worse was that when he was worse was still possible meet to meet .
And day , in the world we live in -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the expectancy -- the massive , we can hope is that things are at the altitude of the expectations .
You never have surprised because your expectations , because your expectations , you 're ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here is , " Basse aspectative , " Yes , you want . "
I mean , a little autobiographical moment -- which I 'm really sposed and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't have to do better , I don 't have to have .
But , you know , it 's not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of jeans , and it 's only that kind of jeans is that when you don 't satisfacts , and I ask you , " Why do you ? "
" Who is responsible ? " The answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy one insod-to-satisfacing , and you ask you who is responsible , it 's as a clear that responsible .
You 'd like to do better .
With hundreds of available varieties , there are no fairly for the success .
So when people are making decisions , even though the result is , they 're going to insoftware , and they give the colcollege to them .
In the last few years , the depression of the depression of the industrialized world .
I think a meaning factor -- not the only one , but important -- this is the only one of depression is that people have deludent experiences because the standard are too high .
And when they need to explain this situation think that colcolors is them .
So the end result is that we 're better , in general , we 're better , but we feel worse .
Let me reminds you .
This is the official dogma , what we all all take for good and it 's completely falready .
There is no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than haven 't better at all but it 's not a lot better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magical value . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been super-based by a piece of the level where choices are best life .
Now , from politician -- I 've almost finished -- from politician , the politician is the following .
What it allows all this choice in industrial societies is the material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too poor too .
So the face of the easy of the modern facility of modern , reminds societies .
And what it does to be like , and the arrage is this : Steve Levitt talked about how those expensive and discovers for bimbers are inuses . It 's a spring money .
I mean these choices , complicated and dispendious , it 's not just unuseful .
They are a deleteries .
They make it worse .
If a little bit of what in our societies allows choice was reversed in those where people have too populest people , it would be not just their lives better .
This is what economists call a paretary improvement .
One refined refined it 's good at all -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice in a way that comes back .
To conclude , " Fild , you can become all you want to be --
You know , people are about culture , you want to think , " What does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make anything in a wind . "
" A imagination castrated , a limited vision of the world --
and I 've interpreted it so , at the beginning .
But then , think , instead , instead , I realized that that that fish the long-lifetime .
Because the reality of fact is , if you eat the boat , so that , so that , " all you don 't get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the bocket so that all you can decrease as a satisfation .
Accer the paralysis , and you 'll reduce the well-being .
They all need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too , maybe for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some sphere is a recipe for infection and , for the roine .
Thank you for heart .
