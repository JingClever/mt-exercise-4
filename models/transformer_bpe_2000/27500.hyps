I showed this last year I showed these slides to demonstrate that the glacial glacial , which for almost three million years has had the size of the U.S. continental , it 's reduced 40 percent .
But this subjects that gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice of the ice .
The glacial glacial cleaning is , in a way , the heart of the global climate system .
It 's winter and reverse it .
The next slide is going to be a quick carlated on on the last 25 years .
The ice perennia are signed in red .
You see , they get down to the blue ,
That 's the ice in the winter , which is the summer .
You can see the ice cosid-year-old ice or more , is like the blood , that 's like blood here , that 's like the blood here .
In 25 years , it 's been from so , to like that .
This is a problem because the scale of the interest is the lacier of the ocean , where there are huge amount of coal congeled that , meled , they 're transformed in the microbes .
And the totality of the totality of the atmospherical atmospherical , that amount could be super-double , that amount of the world .
In some laghs in Alaska , the methane is already rebulating from the water .
The professority of the University of Alaska of Alaska of Alaska team pressed with a team clar on the scored .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You 're good . The question is if we 're going to be .
A reason is that this termal exchange surface of the Greenland from the northermal .
This is a glacial fied glacial .
And he never reached it never had to levels .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the West Southwest of Greenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea level of the ice of the ice , here is where you get to the sea .
These corrups are increasing rapidly .
At the other part of the planet : Antarctica of ice of the planet .
The last month of the ice scientists have diclearly is in negative , and that the Antarctica , and the Antarctica , which is particularly free in in some island islands , is particularly free .
Equeue to six meters of the free , like Greenland .
Himalayas , the third biggest block of ice , they see new laghi , which few years ago were glacier .
Four world population was half of the world 's population half of the world 's population .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the water of the city .
The brought it is increased .
But when it decreases , the same happens to the same access to the water .
In California the snow on Sierra Nevada is diminuit 's diminuit .
The backkkkay are in cribe .
predictions , as you read , they 're gravi .
The growing growing saw cities in the world leads to a remarkable increase incendes .
The environmental disasters are increasing a return out of the normal and without precedental and without precedental .
Four times more number of times the number of years , than the last 30 years I 've been doing 75 .
This is a listening of all sustainable .
If you look at it in the stories of historical , if they can see the consequences .
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 24 million tons of tons in the oceans every day .
Look attentily the area of the East Pacific , the American area , the American , and the west , and on both the seats of the Indian oxygen west in the oceans .
The major causes of global warming , with the deforestation , which is 20 percent of fossil fuel .
The oil is a problem , and coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the most emissions , with the most emissions , together at China .
And he was proposed to build a lot of other central mix .
But we 're seeing a change of direction .
These are the annoullates projects in the last few years and some alternative alternative versus .
And every way , there 's a lot of politics in our country .
The coal industries of the oil and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting coal coal , which is a bone .
And that picture of me remember something --
I 'm going to be Natal , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion liters of coal switches .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second largest flow of scories in America .
It 's happened around Natal .
The nature of the coal of the coal industries was this .
Video : Wicarbon is a kind of allegror is a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's going to grow our economy .
Frosty the carbon is and more and more clean .
It 's a good price , adorable , and the workers are keep the stypenddium .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest ministrator society is Massey Coal . This is his amministrator .
Video : Don Blanker : I 'm going to be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Protection of Clima has launched two campaiged campaiged .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Atore the COLergy see we see climate change change as a serious thing to our business .
So our priority is investing a great amount of money in a public public to make public and confused true to reach up the truth of coal .
It 's actually , coal is not sports .
We think it 's clean -- it also a good way .
So not preokay about climate change .
Let 's go to us .
Video : Atman : Carbone , you 've heard a lot of it .
So , you get a turn in a pattern in a structure that 's about the coal of the coal clean .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little bit of the coal technology , but that 's the sound of the technology of clean .
The coal of the coal is between major crule of global warming , but the remarkable technology of clean that you see changes everything .
You see a look at it . This is the hodial technology .
Al Gore : In the alternative , positive alternative economic security and to the national security and the national security .
Video : The America is in America is in cribe ; the economy , the national security , the national security .
The field that the lines of all : our dependence on fossil fuel , like the coal and oil and oil imported oil .
Now , there 's a new new , car , car solution for used to use .
Repower America : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A to reput America to work in the work , make us more safe , and help us to stop global warming .
It was inally , a solution that you can solve our problems .
Repower America . Scover than you .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's about re-energy to America .
One of the faster ways to get the end of the dependence from combustible combustic that kills our planet .
What 's the future is here . The future is here . I just like , a new energy network .
What it 's a little bit of the investment for bought to work ben retribual work .
Comvice : Repower America . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A vear of the African said , " If you want to go fast , you go to the fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
The year at TED I did an introdution in LHC .
And I promised to return to the way to travel .
So there I 've got to the other time . And the other time there was not , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever -- 27 miles of circumference .
His task is to remember the conditions that were less than a billion a second one one million of the universe -- until we have to 600 million times a second .
It 's just environment .
This is the machine under Ginevra .
We hhit these mini-Big Bang inside the relativelies .
This is what I work on . It 's called ATLAS -- it 's 44 meters and it has a diameter of 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions .
Ten September September year we have access the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was causes of immense to control in the room of control .
It 's a picture of the first picture of the particles that had all made the turn of the LHC , enterally , by a part of the LHC , and spread particles in the lad , and spread particles inside the relator .
In other words , when we see that image 10 , the 10 september , we understand that machine worked , which is a great victory .
I don 't know if that was this to get us more or more or this , when someone went to Google and saw that the initial page was this .
That means we have a cultural impact beyond to the scientific impact .
It was a week after , there was a problem with machine , I had to these dorges here -- these dorges dored dorges .
These files are 13,000 amps when the machine works at the power of power .
Now , the technicians between you look at the bottom and say , " It 's not true . They 're too throws . "
And they can do that when they 're very cold slies they become the cosidden flows .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a time time to the space of space between stars , these files can bring that corrate that corrate .
In one of the guntures of the most of the names magnetets in LHC , there was a fect of fabbrication .
So the files are screes , and the 13,000 press of the press of electricity .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnets more than 20 tons , and that they 've moved about 30 centimeters .
They 're saying about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we had to do .
We restined them and advertising .
They 're returning everybody to the place underground .
And the end of the end of the LHC will be again .
We 'll accinate it , and we expect to get the data to right or lights , and we continue so our adventure to discover what the morning is the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these incidents reaching the dibate on the value of science and engineering in frontier of science and engineering . It 's easy to concentrate .
I think that 's so difficult , the fact of going to go beyond the limits , I think that 's the value of things like LHC .
I would like to conclude with the words of a Inglese scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , I imagine , in the defense of the experiments of his own puple , Michael Faraday , said , " Nichael is so dangerous for human returns that the ideas of the human return to the ideas that are not in nature , and that 's not completes in nature , and that our tripushes are not new ways that our monsters to be completely new monknew , and that our monkey worly-new works of the ideas of the ideas of the ideas of the world , and that are , and that 's ideas are new worms are , and that our world , and our world , and the ideas are not be complets of the ideas of the ideas of the ideas of the ideas are new worth of the ideas of the ideas of the
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to rethink about when you 're children , you play with kids , play with the morning .
And as you realize them and you get them and deal them , and take them and move them , and they 're actually learning to think and solving problems captures and manipulating relationships .
The space spatial is deeply connected to the way we understand the world around us .
So , as information is a very inspired by the uses of our physical interaction with objects , and my conon Patts , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only cursence of the mouse as a cloud , we could deal with a desktop of the digital ,
and systemard-pleasure ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , and building the answer , and building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable , it 's a big computer interactive interactive as a cookie .
In a few words , a Siftable , it 's a big computer interactive interactive as a cookie .
You can move them with your hand , they can see " between them , " I hear their movement and they can be a screen and a radio radio .
But absolutely , they 're physical objects , like the morning , you can just move them .
The Siftable is a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physical , consciously , of the movement , of others , and as they become more physical consciously , of how we move , we can explore new and fun new slide and fun new interaction .
I 'll start with a simple example .
This Siftable is configurated to show video : if it 's in a direction , the video role like this , if you 're going to the other side back back .
These interactive rats are conscious of the other .
If you 're looking at , they 're interested in what they 're going to do .
If they 're surrounded , and they can get a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , and they can get a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power of the data , to give us a color like a color like it .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurated as sect and I can use them to color in that central color in that central , where they missing .
and I can use them to collect color in that central , where they mismissing .
If we 're too much , we can reput a little bit to place .
It also 's also beautiful possibility of appreciating , like languages , the math and games where people can try to fast things fast , and see the results of the results , and see the results of the results .
I 'm now --
This is a Fibonacci sequence that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a game of words that 's half between Scarabean and Boggle .
Pratically , at every turn to remember a letter to every turn on the Siftable , at every turn to remember a letter to every turn a letter on every Siftable , and while you try to understand words him on a diary .
And then , after about 30 seconds , you get a new set of letters and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here 's children came in the Media Lab , I did them , and I did them , and I took them a video video .
They 're very much .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don 't have to people many education .
You 've only say , " It 's going to say , " It 's going to do it .
That 's how other people who are trying to .
This is our younger header , there on the right there .
It really wanted to impact them .
They were only morning , for him .
Now , this is a application of a carddboard .
We wanted to build a device for the apprints of languages .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving Siftable , they 're just liften .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving Siftable , they 're just liften .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sunlight is source .
David Merrill : Now he brought a tractor in the scene .
Video : The tractor treator .
Bel work ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes !
So I school with the Siftable and put up near-to-cut can interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
and by using their story .
Video : Hao !
DM : It 's a story with final opened , and he can decide him how it goes .
DM : It 's a story with final opened , and he can decide him how it goes .
Video : Voly , gat .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool , realized , to be a tool , to walk and execk music .
It 's a device , recently , to be able to walk and exectle music .
The Siftable here are suund as well , based and the battery .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also be insert these sounds in a sequence to bug your lifting .
And it just to move it to just do a " and a sequence . "
These are actually that you can control from the vive , like reverbs and the filter .
It 's a particular sound , and then including it .
And then there are the effects as time and volume , and it 's applying the whole sequence .
We look at how it works .
Video : DM : We 'll start putting a base in two Siftable " in " two Siftable , we 're going to address , we add other base .
Now I put a line of basically .
Video : DM : Now I add some percussions --
Video : And I 'll put the battery to the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the vive .
Video : DM : I can fall the whole sequence by one side or by one side .
Video : And I 'll add the filter of the bottom of the bottom to get more expression .
Video : DM : I can recombine the sequence .
So I don 't have to planning it first , but I can improvisate it , and it 's longer or more corta .
And now , finally , I can smoking the whole sequence by by by the Siftable "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new human human human human human human face and more like to be our brain and more more more more like how our brain and body works .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this pattern , and also some possibility that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that new generation of the protecting generation of objects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk with all of you .
I 'm a writing .
I 'm writing books is my profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and the love and the fascine of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , he said this , something particular happened in my life and my career , which took me to recoaling the whole thing with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called " Manogy , Prega , Ama " which , diversed from my precedented , for some reason that in the world and become a big sensationally , sensional , became a lot , sensional , wil-sely , became ,
And the result is that everywhere now , people go treat me as if I was condanned .
It 's true -- condannated , condannated .
They 're now worried about now and they say , " Don 't you fear more than doing better ?
Do you 're not fear to continue to write for all life without being able to create a book that can important someone ? "
what can it important to someone ? "
It 's rashing , you know .
But it could go worse , part of that I remember 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a adolescent adolescent -- I wanted to be a writer .
I went to meet the same reaction of the fear .
And people say , " Don 't you get it ?
Don 't you fear that the umiliation of the refree refed you ?
Don 't you fear of well-willing to be able to get this and die on a heart of dreams with a dreams of fauling with a bought of faulure to falliment to falliment .
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I 'm fear of all of things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also fear of a lot of other things that people could not have to be .
As the others and other things spent things .
But , as I think about writing that what I thought and wondering about the last multimely is why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's a lot that anyone who has to expected to be spent by a job that you feel to do .
But what 's there so particular in the impress of creative impress by the mental health of the health of other careers do not do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember of only one in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he was fear to be engineer ?
It wasn 't it -- that block of the engineer John , how does it ?
It doesn 't work like that , you know ?
Onestly , chemical engineers like group don 't certainly , in the secoli , driven reputation of being handed handed .
We have enough , we have enough this reputation , and not only writers , but creative to every gender , we have this reputation of being huge instable mentally .
And it 's not recently about the sad of the magnificent dead of the magnificent minds that only in the 20th century , they died young and often for them .
And the ones that they don 't have suicipath to be really dissatisfied by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he died in the last interview said , " " I 've been a little more " " " " " extraordinary affermation about work at work .
But we don 't buy the way we feel that because we heard these things that in some way we 've been completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering is in some way , and the art , at the end , at end , at the end , it will will be a hard to rate .
And the question I want to bring everybody here is : you 're right now : You 're agree with this idea ?
It 's good , it 's just about this thing -- because he also looks at a centimeter of me , it doesn 't really well for anything .
I think it 's hath .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encourage our great creative minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case , in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start fire out of the support of the support of the surrounded I 'm in my career .
It 's just like , you look at , they 're quite young , I 'm pretty young , I 've got about 40 years .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely to write that any thing I 'm going to be judged by the world as the work that I was going to spend my last book .
I 'm going to be slavery , because we 're all more or less friends here -- that my greatest success is to my walks .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start behind a person to start gin the morning and I don 't want to do that .
I would like to continue to continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question is , how to be ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflections , that the way to work to continue to write is to create a psychological costrap , OK ?
I have to have a way of security between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural anxiety on which is written reaction that can get . And as I was trying to all the time to do it , and I 'm trying to do this year , and we found other society to see if they could have the best ideas to be the best ideas and more health of my ideas and more switching .
in how to help people create creative to manage the risks of creativity .
And that research has led me to the ancient Great and ancient Rome .
I 'm just because it turns out to the circle and then back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity was from men , OK ?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit of the becomes to divine and that came to men by a few source , and unknown , to the slightly and unknown .
The greenhorge bits of creativity of creativity of the " demons . "
Socrate , wonderfully , he believed to have a demon that elarged wisdom .
Romans were the same idea , but they called that kind of spirit with a genius .
which is great , because the Romans didn 't really think that a genius was really a genius to be someone who was very intelligent .
They need a genius was a kind of a divine that was literally lived in the walls of a divine , a little like the Dobby , and that came out of a artist , and that came out of the job of the artist and pattern of the job of the artist and the result of that work .
It 's the distance of -- here is the distance of which I speak about -- that psychological costruction that you protected from the results of your work .
And everybody knew that it was so that it worked , right ?
So the anti-clear artists were protects from certain things , like , for example , right too much , don 't ?
If your work was exceptional work was not evil to take all the goods , everybody knew that they were helped by this genius .
If your failure work , it wasn 't all your bad , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable .
And so people han concept creativity in the West for a long time .
And then the Rinasciation came and everything changed , and it was born this big idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe of the universe of the universe of the universe of the misters and no longer leaves to write devicials that they write from divinity .
This was the principle of human rational and people started to think that creativity was completely by iliity .
And for the first time in history , he started to refer this or that artist as a genius as a kind of a kind of a person with genius .
And I have to tell you , I think that was a big mistake .
I think I allow someone , just to believe that a simple person to believe that it 's like a recipient , and the source of all of my divins , creative , inconcible , inconcible , and a responsibility of a lot of humans too large to the fragile human psychc .
It 's how to ask someone to inguess the sun .
It 's a beautiful distores and completely all these insumed inextable to performance .
And I think it was that was this pressure to have artists in the past 500 years .
And if that is true , and I think that 's true , and I think that 's the question is , and now ?
We can do it different ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery .
or no .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there is probably people between the audience that would be a suspects of scientific , that you know , insom that they do people do spect their own projects .
I 'm probably not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I would like to take is -- why is not ?
Why don 't you think that way ?
Because it 's more sense of everything that I ever heard to explain the exaspering impreve-dibility impreve-dibility process .
A process that , as anyone who ever ever ever ever ever loved to do something -- so , everybody here -- it doesn 't understand rationally .
And , in fact , it can sometimes it seems to be completely paranormal .
I did this inmet with the extraordinary poetetesse , Ruth Stone , who has been a poetesse for all life and said that was a poetesse for all life and said that during his childhood in the Virginia , and he felt it , he was working out in the wind , and I felt it , in the field of life , and he was going to be a landscape .
He said that he was like a fragorous of air .
And that was rotating to rotating her to the landscape .
It was to be , because he was a way to be a way to be a land-often .
He had a only thing to do to do that point and it was , " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " "
And so it goes back to home and come home and he wouldn 't have to make some piece of paper and a couple of paper and a fairly , while the traphion , and I would take it to a piece of paper .
Sometimes he couldn 't be fast fast , so he goes and it goes to get into home and the rotolar rotolar and he would continue to rotolar into the landscape and he would continue to rotolar through the landscape , how she said , " one else , how she said , " another poet . "
And then there were the time -- this piece of the way I would never forget -- there were moments where it was almost losing , OK ?
So , he was running to house and and he was trying to paper and the poem was going through , and he was going to a match in the way , and then he said , " He was like , that if you 're smoking with the other hand and the step .
He was offered the poem from the tail and reput it in his body and transpent the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page and it 's called but the last word at the first word .
So when I felt that I thought -- it 's a role , it 's exactly equal to my creative process .
I 'm not a process of creative -- I 'm not a condition !
I 'm a music , and my way to work is to work is ; you wake up to the same orary every day and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go to work and go and go and go to work and go and go and go to work and go and go to work and go and go to work and go and go to work and go and go to work and go to work and go and go and go to go and go to work and go and go and go and go and go to work and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and
But even I , in my head , I 've striped against that thing , I was a bad .
And I imagine that many of you , many of you , the han fact .
You know , even if the work work and ideas came to me from a certain source I could not be honestly saperus .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relationate to it so that you don 't lose your head , but , rather , what does it do you get to snans ?
And as I think about it , the best example of the Tom Waits , which I have is the Tom Waits , which I interviewed a lot of years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of the artist moving back , trying to contemporary these species of creative totally interized these species of creative totally interized interized .
But then I invected , he 's calculus , and one day as he was driving on a car to Los Angeles , he changed everything to him .
It was going to fast and all of a traction of a sent of melody , which comes in his head as inspiration , elusive and straining , and the wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and it 's not how to take it .
It doesn 't have a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a math , it doesn 't have a paper .
So he starts to hear this kind of old anxiety growing in him like , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'll be obsessed by this song .
I 'm not enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , they stop .
It was the whole mental process and he did something completely new .
He just looked at the sky and said , " Shush , don 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" Do you look like that 's a song now ?
If you really want to be back back to a more opports when I can take care of you .
And I go to important something more than another today .
You go to disturban Leonard Cohen . "
And his process workers to change after this .
I don 't work , the work was still dark like work .
But the process , and the weight that was re-leaved when the genius , the genius that was causes out of him , the genius that 's causes and flew it back from , and he remainly remained that he had to be an interized , and come back .
but it 's just a little bit of the peculious , bears a conversation between Tom and this strange thing that it was not Tom .
So how I hear that story started to change a little bit of the way I worked and already worked and already me .
This idea , I was writing , when I was writing " Manogy , Ama , " and fall in one of those cause of the disperation where we 're working on something and we can 't start to think that it 's going to be a dispersed , which is going to be the worst of the books that is the worst of the worst who is the worst of the worst written .
not only bad , just the worst books .
And I started to think about gone this project .
But then I remember of Tom that was talking about air and I tried us .
So I get my face in the lack and I realized my commments to a vacuum vacuum of the room .
And I said to high voices , " Well , what do you get to know if this book is not going to be interacting with my , no ?
Because as I see I 'm going to put it all I have , I don 't have more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to present and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I 'm not flew .
I 'll try to writing the same because it 's my work .
And I would like to please that I 'm shown that I 'm shown to do my part of the North , " Why it 's so , I sat the witch of North people were saying for damage of the moon , dances of the midddamage of the sacred , dances to hours and hours .
And they always were magnificent , because the ballerins were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every once , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists becomes actually transpendent .
And I know you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you have seen that , at some point , a performance like that .
It was like the time it stops , and the ballery walking through a kind of a balerine kind of a balerine , like 1,000 nights before , but all of the 1,000 nights before , but all of the 1,000 nights before , but all of it .
And sudden not appeared as a human .
But it 's accinitiate from the divinity in the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , the time , the people knew what was called it with his name .
They knew their hands and started to canter , " Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , God . "
That 's God , you know .
Curios known stories -- when the Morinvaders the Spain , I got this abitude with them and pronounce in the centuries of " Allah , Allah , Allah , " Allah , " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " Ole , " " " " " " " " " " " Ole , " " " " " " " " Ole , " " " " " " " " " " Olay , " The words , " The south , " The south , " Hump
In Spain , when a artist has done something impossible and magical , " Allah , " Allah , " the word , " Allah , " I 'm going to recognizes , " " The scorce of God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But the problem is goes after the day , for the ballery itself , when you wake up and discover that 's 11 morning of Martedans and scorce God is no longer .
It 's just a mortal with bad gran to the ginoccurred , and maybe it will never hear to that already altitude to that altitude .
And maybe no one will switch the name of God still while it 's going to do with his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painctions to do in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angos to be so anutt if you can 't believe , instanding , the most extraordinary aspects of your own .
But you just believe that they 're going to be a flip of this source of this squisite part of your life that you 've got to go to someone else when you 've finished .
And , you know , if we think it all changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly how I thought for different months in the work of the book that I can publish soon , the dangerous , spent , spent , dangerous , I was going to do that , I was going to think that 's a great success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel elected by this is , not having fear .
It doesn 't flew . It 's only your work .
It 's a present to your part , any part , any of it can be .
If your work is balling , balance .
If the divine , absurd genius to get to leleave some kind of wonderful , for one moment through your effort , then " then
You do , you do the same dance .
" Ole ! " at yourself .
I think I have to teach it .
" Ole ! " to yourself , even only to get love human heads and tals to hold you to deal with a lot of them to present continuously .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And as you know I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean and the discovers of new genes .
We 're starting a new path . We started digitalizing biology and now starting to the digital code we 're going to go into a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We always have tried to get big questions .
" What is life ? " is something that many biologists I think they 've loved a little bit of livels .
We tried different approaches , reduced it to the terms .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treating the human genome of biology in the digital world of computer computer .
We 're going to ask : we can regenerate life , or new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genitalium that can autoreum in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create one more smaller .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 of the way that I 'm here .
But when we take a look at his map map , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
I records , this is simple .
But when we look at all of the genes we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very improbable that this can bring a living cell .
So we decided that the only way the only way to progrew that was synthesize this chromodify way to get some of these questions .
And so we started the adventure of " " " " we can synthesize a cromosoma ? "
It can be the chemistry consciously we 've never been able to create before we get these great molecules that we never get to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a cromosom , we can get a cromosom ?
A cromosoma is simply a piece of chemical material .
The speed that we 're able to digitalize life is growing exponential exponential .
Our skills of the genetic code , rather procredit , rather slowly , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results that they get the branch on a exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process has requires a lot of pass , beginning with a bioetic review before we started the first experiments .
But we found that DNA synthesize that 's very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines in the world that make small segment of DNA , the longer of 30 to 50 lective longer , the segment is more than the segment is longer , the segment is more errors .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correct correct .
And this was our first attempt atory genome , to start from the digital information genome of Phi 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills batters .
We 've designed the frments , effectively the correction of errors and get a molecule of DNA , about 5,000 lets lets .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material inert and we put it in the bacteria , the bacteria have started read this genetic code and to produce viral particles .
The viral particles were re-leaved by cells , they 're back and destroy the Ely-holds .
I talked about recent with a members of the oil industry , and they say that they have certainly compress that they 're really understood this model .
They 've got more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in big .
We wanted to build the whole cromosom of the bacteria .
They 're more than 580 miles readers of genetic code .
So we thought we 've thought of a seven of the virus of the virus , so that we can change the casses to understand what the components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard accuratess was a mistake for every 10 mistake .
We found , we resequency , 30 mistakes . If we used that original sequence , we would never be able to do that work .
One part of the process is designing long , long , and then , that 's a lot of segment to have all the other segment of 50 letters lets to build more small craft to work together .
We try to the only one here .
You probably have read a lot of you read that we put on the file file .
Think it up so : we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , C , C , Gs and T.
Three of the reading lectal , and there 's a specific order to be a specific order to letter every lower adminoacid .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frames , frames , thoughts .
What we did at the beginning was autographed .
Some of them were because of the fact that it wasn 't poetry .
We 've designed these segments to just une them with enzyme .
There are enzes that repair them and put them together .
And we started assemble to assemble parts , beginning with seven to seven mile , and then we can make a seven to a segment of 24 mile letters to get to 72 mies reading to 72 mile letters .
And we have these sequency sequency in a step , so that we 're trying to create a very robustood process of extremely robustood -- you 'll see in a minute .
We 're looking for authomatizing the process .
So , this looks like a basket of a basket .
When we get to these very long segment , more than 100 mile , more than 100 mile , they 're not going to grow directly in the East .
It goes to the limit of modern tools of the molecular biology .
So we looked at other mechanisms .
We knew , we had another mechanism called " homologa , which in biology to repair the DNA can be able to repair the DNA .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , it can absorbed three million rads .
You can see in the super-high requarter as his chromosom is destroyed .
In 12 -- 24 hours , it 's been reassembled exactly how it was before .
They 're thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms you can sat completely .
They can live under vacuum .
They 're absolutely certain that life in space , and you know , you know , to find new water environments .
In the true , NASA has shown that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processes , just using the least design with the segment of segment to insert .
The least assemble to the automatically .
This picture was not taken with a microscope with a microscope , but with a microscope with a microscope .
It 's a lot of the great molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that they cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publish that we did .
They 're more than 580,000 lets of genetic code .
It 's the biggest molecule of a defined structure that man ever created by man .
It 's a weight molecular weight to 300 million .
If we stammal with a 10 without spaces , you would like 142 pages , they would just like 142 pages to track this genetic code .
Now , how do we do it ? How do we activity it ?
Of course , you love a virus is a young young guy .
It 's a little more complicated when they use bacteria get .
It 's also simpler when it 's simpler cells as ekarote as our : you can just extract the nucleus and insert another , which is basically the clonation of clonation .
In the bacteria , the cell cell is instead of integrated inside to the cell , but we have recently demonstrated that we 're able to do a transplant with a cell to another and activity .
We can have a cromosom parting by a microbial species .
The two are different as humans from the topi .
We 've added some gene more so that you could decide what choose to choose for this cromosoma .
The men with the sciols with the encies in a way to kill all proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was stupendent -- and you 'll open-up our sophisticatoomic graph -- the new cell cell cell .
And we were we thought we could not go beyond , but we tried to spingeres more in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that a lot of species have added that a second or a third cromosom from some of thousands of tracks to that species .
So who think about evolution as only a gene to evolution as a gene that it doesn 't understand the biology of biology .
They 're called the DNA restriition of restriition that advantage of the DNA .
The cromosoma that was in the cell doesn 't have one .
The cell cell cell that we 've inserit-cell .
It 's expressed , and recognized the other chromosom as a very expressed material , and we found us with only cell cell cell and the new cell cell .
It blue has become blue because of the genes we put .
And in a short time , all the characteristics of a species , they went to , and it turned all of all of a new species , based on the new species that we 've been insered in the cell .
All the proteins are changed , the member member changes , and when we read the equival code exactly to what we 've been transfer to what we 've been done .
Now , this could look at genetic , but we 're going to be a genetic DNA , we can change things in a way of such things in a way of such .
Now , I 've already explained that you don 't talk about genesis -- but we 've been progress from three million years and a half years of evolution , and I 've already said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian , where they 'll be created new species of this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's quite obvious when we think about our needs .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion to nine billion in the next 40 years .
Just to give an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 , they 'll be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh and clean , clean and bal-half billion and a half billion and a half billion people .
It will be more tough to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion coal , more than 30 billion baries of the oil .
That means percent million baries a day .
When we try to find biologic processes , or any kind of process to rempize them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep connected of all the CO2 emission from these materials that it 's in the atmosphere .
At day day , thank you to scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they 're designed to think that they 're designed to be the future .
The electronic industry only only , a dozen about components , and think about how many different things came out .
Our limits here is basically by biological reality and our imagination .
We have techniques , because of these metods of rapid synthesization , that we call genomics combinatory .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a lot of cromosomes a million cromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes or or to try to get eight of the processes to produce eight or drugs , new vaccines , and we can change , and we can change , thank more biology . And create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology ,
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for possibility of survival , production , chemical or or fuel , production of vaccines .
This is a few of some software programmed that we 're working on to be able to seat and design species to seat and design species to computer .
Well , we don 't know how they will be .
We know exactly what the genetic code .
We 're now focusing on quarter of quarter .
You 've also seen that that extract ethanol from the grate was a event .
We have a lot of second-third generation that will be soon as soon as a very high value as the higher value of butanol .
But the only way biology can have a lot of impact without increase to increase more impact the cost of food and limitarm the cost of food and limitaren 't going to be CO2 in matter before , we 're working for working for cells that can be able to get this , and we think we could have this discovers , and we think we could have the first couple of months .
The light sunlight sunlight is a metodownis a metodownstood -- but in our discoveries all the world , we found different metods .
This is a organism we described in 1996 .
It lives in the ocean , about 2500 feet of depth of the water .
They 're using the CO2 CO2 using multiple hydrogen molecular source .
We 're trying to figure out if we can meet CO2 , which can easily be translated by tubes , convert that CO2 in the fuel , to drive this process .
So we think we could be able to increase what we could be able to increase what the basic question of the basic question , " which is Nice , we have the goal of the goal of the obic industry .
You know . If you can 't do it from TED , where can you ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And we 're working on using the same metods to create vaccines of instantaneous wells .
You 've seen this year with influence , we 're always back to a year and a dollar at least when you 're going to find the vaccine , right .
I think that you can change building fighting vaccines to a lot of fighting .
That 's how the future could start to look at change , and it 's changing evolution , acceling the evolution of synthetic , and then finally cellusterating eucariote .
We 're so much as the improving people .
Our purpose is to do enough to live long enough to try to do it . Thank you .
First of all I 'll show you , the most rapidly possible , some work of the new technology that we 've taken to Microsoft soft in the following a year ago , exactly . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment where you can interact is to local level that remote with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of gabyte picture with a kind of photostant and continuous , for a panoramic speed , and then , for a panoramic speed , how we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big amount of information that we see , how big these are collected data or images or the images .
Most of the photographs , but this for example is a scanning scanning from the Bilibrary of Congress , and then restens in the mom of 300 megapixel .
It doesn 't do any difference because the only thing that limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any moment . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data doesn 't images .
This is the Dickens of Dickens . Each colonna represents a capitle .
And to show you that it 's just about text , and not images , we can do something like this , to make a real thing of this , to make a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read a book .
It doesn 't you consider it .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of The Guardian .
Each big picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and beautiful experience of a card version or a quotidian , which is for nature of a quotidian , which is for nature a moltedian .
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We created a fasules higher advertising -- much higher than what you use in a normal advertising -- and we put you into a normal advertising .
If you want to see the careful of this car , you can see them here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on screen .
We hope that it means to put the end of the pop-up and other cheries like that , I don 't have to be necessary .
Of course , the maping is one of the most obvious applations for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't have to tell you that we have contributes to do this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. Holls a geospspspspspspatial of NASA .
So now we go to something else .
This now is actually the windly vive to the web ; you can go to the web .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research at the Noah Snavort computer very interesting research from Noah of the University of Washington of the U.S. of the U.W and Rick Siskeliskels of Microsoft Rick . " A very good collaboration .
And it 's from the Web , gested by Seadragon .
You can see that when we do this kind of pattern , where we can go from a picture and have this kind of experience and have this kind of experience to multiple solution .
But the spact of the images here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization computers have registed these images together , so that corresponding to the real place in real place that images -- all screen to the Grases on Montagne Roccial Montagne Roccious canadesiesian -- they 're taken . So , you know , you 're going to see elements of a slightly , and these things are all the space space that you 're all connected with the space level .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some much more spatial .
I want to go directly to one of the original data Noahholding -- and this is from a previous prototype of Photosynth that we 've done is really the scorce gaxed , to show you what this technology , the technology Photosympth , technology Photosympth . And it 's not necessarily , looking at the environments we put in the website .
We had to worry about legal things and forth .
This is a rebuild of the Notre catthedral of Notre of Dame in Flickr . Basta digitar . Basta digitar , and you get images of types in the maglies , other campus and saying . Oone of these cons represents a picture that 's discovers a picture of this .
So they 're all pictures from Flickr and they were all connected to the space space level in this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this way simple .
You know , I would never have thought of wind-work to Microsoft .
It 's very gratificing to receive this kind of according here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different types of different kinds of photos : from the phones to the phones of the SLR professional number of meaning , must , in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try to look for those strange .
Many of them are block , and that 's that .
You 've got a lot of photographs -- there 's a series of photographs -- there .
This is a Notre of Notre Dame recorrectly .
We can go from the poster to the vision of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This now is taking data from the supply collective data -- from the inter-memory of the visual -- and you connect all of those data together .
All those pictures are connected with them , more than the sum of parts .
You have a model of the Earth is that it emerge .
Think about this as a couple of Stephen Lawler 's work on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as a lot of people as it , and the advantages to the use of the use of increasing with use .
Their picture are marbed with a path , and they 're dealing with other people .
If someone is the idea of the idea of the things that 's name , my picture of Notre of the chthedral chthedral of Notre catthedral chthedral of all of these data , and I can use it as a point to immerged in that space , in that space , in that metaphing the picture of everybody , and have a cross-moed social experience of cross-moed ,
Of course , a consequence of all this is virtual models of all interesting models of the earth , collected by any interesting , and satellitaries and satellitary images and satellitarian , but from the memory collective .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : I understand that what your software is that you 're going to do is that a certain point in the next few years , all the photographs , all shared photographs anyone in the whole world will be related together ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing in practice is to discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And he 's doing it in the basis on the content of images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the receptending of semantic information that 's a lot of these images are possibly .
As when you do a research of images on the web , and the text of the web has a lot of information about the web has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what happens if that pictures you connects all your picture ?
So now the amount of semantical interconnection and the amount of receive that is really huge . It 's a very huge classic .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible . It 's really incredible .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the major please when you travel and one of the research of the research etnographic research is the power of living between who has no anti-traditions , between the past , the wind of the past , you touch it in the wind , you 're going to drive plants .
Basti to think that Jaguar travel even beyond the Via of the Via , or that the Milka , or that the Milky 's still colms of meaning , or that in Himalayas , the budddgen of Dharma , to remember the importance of the Dharma , and the idea that the world that the world that the world that the world we live in the liar of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our own standing is done , well or bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of essential tracts .
We all hire . We all try . We do .
We 're subjects to retending .
We have to deal with the inexorability of death , so it doesn 't surprising and whallize --
We all have a art .
What it hits is the specifically rhythm of the song of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they are the " " Borneo the Borneo 's Voodoo Haiti or the Vodoo of the Kaisut Kaisut Kisut in Kenya , or a wander in the Curererring in the middle of the Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak of the Qomolanganger in the Everest , the mate of the world .
All these people teaching us that there are other ways of exists of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of mustard in the world .
And if you reflected a second , it 's a concept that you can give you hope .
And then , the miric of cultures of the world , they create a spiritual life of spiritual and cultual that has volves planet as the planet as the planet as the ragnature as a biological ragnature .
And you can think about this cultural ragagagagagagagagagagagagagagagagger-sum , inspiration of all the concepts , dreams , mites , ideas , inspirations , ideas , inspirations , inspirations , inspiration , inspiration ,
The etnosphere is the patrimonium of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how species .
And because the biosphere was a very quickly consumed altrees and purpose much much more quickly .
No biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent of all species was or is on the hord of the beyond of the beyond of the biologist of biological diversity -- in the field of biological diversity -- and you don 't even even close to the most optimistic diversity .
The index of that is , of course , the language of the language .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the shake of the human spirit .
It 's the middle of which the animal is going to be in the material world .
Each language is a forest of mind , a raind , a spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we sat at Monterey , at least half of the kids .
They don 't get more teacher to kids , which means , unless you won 't walk , and until you won 't willing .
What 's more sad than being the sad than being the silence , of being the last to talk about a language , not to have a language of advancy or to ancient the promission of kids ?
This orring was the state of someone in some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks , every two weeks of a moment , and a moment with the latest syllables of a ancic language .
And I know someone who is going to say , " Isn 't better like that ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we 're all the same language ? " Benism , then we talk all yoruba .
Let 's talk kogs .
You 'll be a trackle thing that means not to talk about his language .
I would like to do a journey through the labeled ethnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosphere to give you a little bit of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of existing exists . " I mean , " different ways of exists .
Let 's take for example , this Barasana bombs in Amazon , the settle-aconia popular anaconda , which creds to the west of the site of the satte of the site patents .
It 's a popular that 's not able to distinguish the blue of green because the green line of the green because the forest is identified in the forest , which depends on popular .
They have a strange language and a matrimonial , detes " " " " " " " " " You have to move a different language . "
And all of this radical has radical in the past , yet the particularity is that in these families that are talking about six or seven language , and it 's seven language of mysts no one language .
They 're limit to listen to hear and they start to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waorani Waorani Ecuador , a popular popular that has been the first contact in 1958 .
In 1957 five missionar , they 've loved a factor of a made .
They did it write from the high photographs that were in a few who were adichevoles , forest that this population population had never seen anything of the pluvial forest .
They collected the picture of the Earth , they spent the research of a form or a figure and , not to be anything , they have concluded that it was a diavy , and they killed the five missionary with lance .
But the Waorani doesn 't just kill the strange of the foreign .
They killed between them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We 've rised up to eight generations and we found two of natural death and when we insisted to know , they had a lot of them to know , they had a lot of invected that one of them , and then they killed it in , and then they killed it in the same .
The crazers were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the first 1980s , I was assigned a very interesting task when my Harvard 's professor when I was asked if I wanted to go to Haiti to Haiti to intruly incrazy , the basic society of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and I impossesser to get the speed of the speed of the speed of the speed to the willing of of the speed to the fast in the first 1980 , I was assigned to get to Harvard to get to the wild of the first of the first 198
So to give a sense of miraculous , I would have to understand the Vodouth culture and that Vodoo is not magnitude .
It 's pretty than a complex metaphysical view of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me about the great religions of the world , what would you ?
Christianesimum , Islam , Buddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent comes up , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious foundation has no religious foundation . And the Vodoo is not that the distillate of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of slavery in the tragic slavery .
What makes the voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So the lives are hijumped to the spirits .
The spirits can be invited by the Great Acqua , they are respected by the dance of dance and they replace to the soul of the vive of the way that a brief a way that for a brief across the goal .
So , the voodooists are love to say , " You know , white white white you go to a talk about God .
We say in the temple and divention the temple and divention .
And from the moment that you 're going to be the spirit that you 're driving you , how can you do you 're going to do you ?
So you 're looking at these incredible events . And you follow voodoo in the state of trance that touch units of the power of mind unfuoes a rather of the body in the body of the body when it 's cataled in a state of extreme , when it 's cataling in a state of extreme .
And in all the popular that I lived the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada de Sierra Nevada de Sierra Marta , Colombia sector sector .
It takes a very hard civilization that once lizes on the planning of Colbia in the caraibia in conquists , the population was going to the vulcanical that you erve on the planture .
In a blood continent , blood continent , this popular , that 's never been conquisted by the spagnology .
And they 're now government by a clero , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people following the families from the families to three or four , and they live secregated in a world that good and shares in a couple of years .
Two draw periods of nine years to reproduce the nine months of gestation that spent in the mother of the Great Mother .
So , that 's all of time , they get accultural values of their society , values that their predict and only their predict , they keep the cost of the cost of the cost ecological ecological .
At term of this incredible begination , they 're improvisually taken out and for the first time in their life , at age of the age of the first wrong of the first clay of the wrong of the first cutes , when the sun crossed , the sun valley of beautiful landscape , everything that they learned in the splending of the behind of this incredible behind of the splending , and says ,
" Yeah ? I 'm told you .
It 's amazing . It 's now to you protect it . "
They 're called the major brothers and say that we , brothers , we 're the holds of the world .
This intuition is extremely important .
When we think about ingene populations and the environment we think about the Resau and old story of the noble self-vage story of the nearest vage , or maybe we can invote and say that these popular population are close to the Earth of us .
The Ingenous population is not feeling within the indebull .
There is no space for these things in the paluds of the Astage or in the winds of the Tibet , but thanks at time and returns , created a mystical of the Earth based of the Earth 's known , but on a very well near-knowledge , but on a blue neighbors -- the concept that the Earth can only live in human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
It 's a little boy of Ande that a boy of Ande that mountain is a spirit of the mountain . Apu that 's going to drit his destiny different , and it will have a different race with the mountain or that place , and it 's going to different , and that place to be a little bit of Montana , who grew Montana 's Montana , and it 's a mass of being sscared .
That 's the demate of a spirit or mineral was irrifying .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the report between the natural world .
I grew up in the forest of the Columbia Britannica credating that the forests served to be cut .
And that 's made me a human being beautiful from my friends Kwakiutl that the forests are the forests of Hukuk and the short of paradise and the stories of paradise and the downbald of the world , spirits that live in the world , spirits that they 're in the earth of Hukukwakiutkutl .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of them sensationally , you can get this plants .
I took this picture to open in the nordoctor in the nordoctor .
Maybe some of you have heard of the ayahuashumpity , the most powerful substance of the sciamanic repertoial repertoial sciamanic .
What macological is not the potential of the physical potential of the phrain , but his elaboration of the substance , but his elaboration from two elements .
As a hand , this leaving leaving a series of radius , hars and hars moles , slightly hologiene .
And if you take the only plant is a blue that 's a blue that 's a little bit of consciousness , but it 's misceled with the leaf of a family said , " The coffee of the coffee said , "
This plan powerful plant , very similar switches , very similar to serotonin the mithoxyltryplyplyplyplyplypltamine .
If you ever see the Yanomami , the nase of the sustainance that make from a different kind of species , anched methoxyltryptyltryltryltryltryptyltrylthoxyltryptle .
And then the polly-s-up for the nose is a bit like being disappeared by a fire paper of pushed paper . And then you get to land-up a degree of electricity . It doesn 't create a distortion of reality .
I wrote a lot with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who waiting the man was psychedelic , with his discovered fungi in in the 1930s in Mexico .
I 'm going to do my tesis not to be a classroom , as you can 't tell these triptles because if you 're not telling one of being hallucinated . And triptles can 't be hallucinated . It can 't be hored to be sentences because they 're money from a enenenzy that 's naturally in the monaminossize .
It 's possible to take a way of just if you just get a little of chemical things that denaturate MAO .
Now it 's the beautiful : the beautiful , which is in this liana are injumps of MAO , the same kind of the same kind of power , to be able to be the triptamine . The question is source spontaneous source , how these people are are not , but if you combine two died morphotos , but if you combine two two died morphooochemical version that 's sumer to the sommma of parts ?
We use the great eupherror of proof and error , which can reveal .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " The plants are talking about it . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , the 17 varieties of ayahuahuahumped , and that our eyes would be in the forest species .
If we ask them how they are they they are saying , " I thought of plants , " I thought of plants , I know about plants , I don 't know all all about ? " I said , " No .
The solution is : you take 17 varieties in a night of lun and each other , and each other , and each other , they 'll have different .
With this doesn 't have laurea at Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that to contate the stami stami .
Now , the problem is that the problem is that even the problem is that the people who are in heart popular popular popular , but in some way to the margins of history in the history of the story in our real world , and it 's more .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it will not remember for his wars or his innovation , but rather like the time we stopped and abbraced activity , and we have abbracing activity of biological diversity of biological diversity of diversity and cultural cultural diversity of the planet .
All of the cultures through the seats have been involved in a dance for new chance of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians don 't stop being Sioux , when they put from the arc and fit as they 're part and flies like Americans don 't stop being Americans when they put from horse and hot .
It 's not the change or technology that they minaces the integrity of ethnosphere . It 's power .
The during the domination fly .
And if you look at the world , I 'll find that these are not cultures that these are not cultures cultures are not cultures .
They 're living and dynamics and dynamics spints out of identify that they 're beyond their ability to adaptation .
Which is that it 's disboscars in the patria of the Penan --
a popular named Sarak , in the Sarak , in the Asian popular that has lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now reducing the service of the reserve of the rive of the re-rive re-rive re-jected , where you can see the uphycle of the Mar Cinese Mar Cinese Mareas , where the Meriday Cinese Meridiononond , where the navi Meridiond , where the Meries the horary Cinese Meries ,
It takes the wood to fit with the wood drew of the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that they came with the discovered of the golden .
If we move on the mountains of the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard of political domination .
As you know the genocide , physical extinction of a popular , it 's a universal level , but ethnocide , ethnocide destruction of life , not only is condannated , but it 's not only under celebrated , but it 's a strategy of development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet of the Tibet until you 're part of the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in the China in the West in China through the Southeast Tibet , I get to Lhasa a young connecting young , but only came to Lhasa I realized what we feel about .
6,000 sacres sacres reduced to polly-holding and .
1.2 million people killed by the military military during the Cultural revolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical to Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to the time of the Chinese invasion .
His , he was smoke with Sua Santity during the diaspora that he 's led the popular in Nepal .
His mother was impresoned and his colpattern was being rich .
It was brought to hidden age in two years , I heard of two years born under his gonna because he couldn 't live without him .
The sister , which did the same , was mesh in reeducation .
And one day he walked a day that 's coffiguring a shap of Mao and , for this transgression , was mession to work for seven years .
The pain of the Tibet can be insuit , but the reinside of the popular of the population is present .
And it 's the end , it all reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the world monocromatical world or we want to across the policicromate world of diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he died said that his greatest pattern was that , in our way to love of the world , we 'll see the whole of human imagination of human imagination , we 'll see the whole of human imagination , but one day we 'll see us from a sone-mentation of human imagination , but one day we 'll see from a sonce of a sonce .
And it 's ulilights of our species is that it 's been for 60,000 years .
The Neolitical Revolution , who has given us agriculture , which did us suck to the seed cult of the seed cult cult , and we 're talking about the sler cult of the cler of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has been 300 years .
That shares that we have no suggests that we have the answers that we have to all the challenges that we should be able to deal in the millennia to come .
When these miric miric miric cultures is asked what it is to say to be human , they say with 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all risky the possibility of being what we are : a conscious species , that has to make everybody , and all the gardins can transport . And there 's great moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the northern extremity of the isola Baffin , when I went to hunting the damage of the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , I told the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The government canadan was not always gentle with the Inuit and in the 1950s to stick our suprematia , we 've restered them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man refected to go .
The family , I tementioned his life , and he took them all the arms , and all his attens .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't teach the cold , and they 're not cold ,
The sled-sled-in origin was made of fish holds .
The grandfather than this man didn 't intimise from the artical night or or the library that was suffering .
It 's gained , it 's calculated the pantalons in skin and defected in your hand . When I did it . When I did the tan , they 've worked by a lama .
He 's spred a spred of this cut and when the slamp of this cut and when they became solid , he killed a dog .
He waiting the dog and created a bunch , with the cass of holds , and he 's got a sled-clands , and it 's disappeared on the ballows , and it 's disappeared on the bal-handed .
We want to talk about cavardless with nothing ? [ Rism ] And this , in different ways , in different ways , and Apausi is the symbol of the world .
In the open canador 1999 government that 's the total government has gone of territory area of the bigger of the larger California and Texas mitting together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's a Independent territory . They all the minerary resources .
One splendido you like a nation-state can recognize with his popular .
And , finally , I think it 's quite obvious at least to people who 's been in these remote zone of the planet , it 's not remote remote .
For someone is house .
They represent of human imagination that are human imagination that are about the high of the time . And for us all the dreams of these children , how the dreams of these kids , becomes part of the hope .
For finally , we have National Geographic we are convinced that politicians will never get to none .
We believe that polemiics --
[ Apasian ] no persuits of opens , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell stories of the world . Each our website , 35 million lived .
156 countries transmit transmit our television .
Our revided the millions of people .
Our work is travel in the way to bring our audience in places of wonders that are cultural anthropolow-up and multicultural revelation of the world 's revelation : the world 's world 's deserve to exists of the world : the world of the dest of life in a pluralists , and multicultural world
where the wisdom of all the popular of all popular to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I 'm going to tell you that you 've already heard and try to evidence some connections , in case not .
I want to start with what I call " the dogma official dogma . "
The official dogma official dogma of what ?
The official dogma official of all industrial societies . The dogma dogma official : " If we want to massive : " If we want to massive " The way to do it is massive . "
The reason is , by a side , in fact that freedom is in the same a value , it 's the precious , useful , essential for human beings .
As the other is that if we 're free , everybody can act for all of us to do everything that massive our well-being , without any of any of the well-being , without any of the name in our well-being .
The way to massive freedom is massive to freedom .
More choice , people are free , and more than they are free , and more than their well-being .
This , I think , it 's so depth to the society that no one would have to be able to deep it in doubt .
And it 's also deeply radical in our lives .
I 'll show you some examples of what progress has been possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I allow me to be a simple notes for insalt .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without the 10 oil varieties of oil and 12 acetes and 12 acetes that you can buy to make you a huge number of conditivast in the surrounding circumstance that no one of 175 already ready ready ready ready for your degree .
That 's what supermarket .
And then you go to the electronics to buy a stereo stereo , CD , lector , radio , radio , radio , radio , plane .
And in this single electronics , there 's a great number of audio components .
We can do six million and a half of different combination using components that there are only in a only store .
You need to admit that there is a lot of choice .
And the camps : the world of communications .
Once I was a child , you could get all the phone services of the desire , to break that they were provide by mama Bell .
It was the phone , he was not buy it .
It 's a consequence of that , between the phone was that the phone has never break .
These template time .
We have a variety of the phones , especially between the phones .
Here 's the mobile phones of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cut holes of the nass , and the burges to the crug .
If you don 't know it 's still seen in the store under home , you 're going to get .
And what happens is that people are in the stick and do this question . And you know , what is the answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So in other things that are much more important than the bubbers of the bubbers , you get the same choices of choices .
Audge health care : it doesn 't happen in the United States that you go to the doctor and doctor tell you what you need to do .
Instead , waving to the doctor , and doctor says , " OK , we could do . A " And they said , " His these benefits and these risks " Be benefits and these risks " " " B has these benefits . What do you do ? "
You 're the say , " Dotter , what would I do ? "
And the doctor says , " It has these benefits and these risks , and these risks , and these benefits . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebats , " Dotter if she was me , what would do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not her . "
The result of the maled result of the maled , expression that it seems to look like a beautiful thing .
But it 's actually not that a move the weight and responsibility to someone that 's something , which is about doctor , to someone else that doesn 't -- and almost of course , and then not in the ideal condition to take the patient decisions to take the patient decisions of patient decisions to take a very very ,
There 's a huge marketing of products drug products , direct people like me and you , that if you think there doesn 't have any sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do you get it ?
The answer is that they want to doctor to ask us to change the recipe .
Something that 's fundamental as it is our identity is a issue of choice , how you see this vision of choice , " We don 't want to force kids . Sceat their sex at the right moment . " We don 't have a identity of the right time , " We have to invent identity : we need to invent .
And we can reinvent how many times you get us .
which means that every morning , at the morning , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I 'm going to be a family and matrimonium , a time , it 's a common time , it was that you know , it was that you were able to be , and he started to get the most possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when you 're , and not when you 're doing after .
And it 's really to play .
I teach very intelligent students , and I 'm 20 percent of work than I work answer to a time .
And not because they 're less brilliant , not because they 're less diligent .
but why are they impensierites , I 'm going to ask , " Would I have to swo or not ?
" Would I have to spoke out of later ? I have to think before the or to the career ? "
They 're interrogative .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this implicated not to completely to be a beautiful vote to my own examples and not get a beautiful vote to my own .
And they really have to do that . They 're very important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl , " The technology allows us to work every single day , every single one corner of the planet , transpls from the Hotel Randolds .
And it 's a parently , and I don 't tell you how to tell you , where the WiFi works works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this incredible freedom of choice we have about work ? It 's about work ? It 's continuously decide , if we have to work or no .
We can go to see our son , and we can go to the cell phone in a cell , the Blackberry in the other , and the notea books .
And even though they 're all spent , every minute we see our boy , we 're also asking the game , " Do I have to say , " Do you know , " I have to say , " Do you know , " I have to say , " Do you know , we 're also wondering , " I have to say , " Do I have to say , " I have to
" I have to answer this letter ? I have to blow this letter ? "
And even when the answer is " no , that 's " " " " all this makes the experience of your son of very different from what was in other conditions .
So , any part of you look at , little things , and large materials and large materials and lifestyle , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Ovention , there were some possibility , but not all that was a question of choice .
The world of today is this : The dilemma is , " Is it a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is Should .
The positive slightly slide them , so I 'm going to talk about the negative ones .
All this choice , two effects of the people who are actually two negative effects on people .
The first , paradosally , is that produces instead of liberation .
With options between which choices to choose , becomes very difficult to do it .
I give you a significant example : a study conduct on the plans of volunteer pencion flip .
A colleague has had access to the Vanch data , the gigantic society of the funding , with about a million clients of implots , with about a million clients .
What she found was that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the offered of the adesion lower , the lower of walks .
With 50 source of offerts , there 's 10 percent in less adesions than they 're only five to five percent of them . Why ?
Because with 50 source of the scale , is sick , maledfy difficult to decide , and the choice is remained to inmorrow .
And then , of course , and of questions , questions , questions , and of course , and of course , and of course , I would never get .
You know that it doesn 't only only only only that these workers are saying food for dogs because they 're not only going to say that the decision is so ostics that they 're also ostics that the funding is so ostics that the funding of the work of the dator of work .
They 're not going to participating , they 're losing to five dollars to work from the dator of work , which would be bought to be .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too much choices .
And I think it 's like this .
" And finally , for eternity : ketchchup , senape or or maionese ? "
You want to take the right decision , if it 's for eternity , if it 's for eternity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong source , and even the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that if we can avoid the paralysis and do a choice , at the end we 're not going to be about options of how we would have been with less options of how we would have been with less options of them .
And that 's for different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions of those is that you can pick up , if you buy a and it 's not perfect , is easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us industry , and the reduce of the sceles , and the reen reen recognize the decision ,
And even when it was a great decision .
And the choices are , easier is easy to dispilefy than any detail that 's insod-dispiece of choice .
Again , there is what economists call the opportunity .
Dan Gilbert assumpets as well as a value we 're going to do things that we 're going to do things with .
In the rest , when there are many options , it 's easy to represent the characternative characternative , and be less satisfacts and be less satisfacts of option that 's choice .
Here 's an example . I school with everybody who 's not New York .
But that 's what you probably think .
There 's this couple to the Hamptons .
It 's a place .
It 's bedded . It 's all journal . It 's all about it .
Not . But what he thinks is , " Well , that he thinks , that 's August . "
" All my neighbors to Manhattan are away . "
" I could talk to just in front of home . "
And it 's pass two weeks of the idea that 's losing -- every day the possibility of parking where it 's going to be .
The constood is the satisfying for what we have , even when the choice was old .
And more are the options we have to think we have to look , more the characteristics attractive , they 'll return against opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things about things .
It 's about living the moment , and maybe living slowly .
But the most important point is that any of you choose to do , you 're choice to do them .
The things that we don 't choose are active attractive attractive what we do .
Third point : explanning of expectative expectations .
I tried it on my skin skin , I buying a new jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
And once the jeans were only like , they buy them and besty them from besty , they were dissimulated , only after they brought them a life and brought a life and bad , and they were lots of times , they started to go well .
So I went to buy a new when the old old old old old old one , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my wrong test . "
The committed said , " He wants to slim , easphed it , and fit ? "
Do you want to the cernier or with the bottons ? " Stonewashed " or " ached " or " ached " ?
" Do you want to be strapped ? "
" Sotto them want to the blaw , " Bla blap blap . " Blah blaw .
I was sitting , and after a little bit , and after a little bit I could say , " I want the kind of like , " I want to say , " I want to have all of the jeans , and then came out of eans , and then use the jeans , I would have been to say , " I would ever have .
It was the massive . And all that choice I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all the choice of my expectations were altitude , the jeans had to be perfect .
I started waiting for me . I won 't expected anything excited when it was only a kind of a kind of , but when I live 100 different , flew , at least a kind of , at least a kind of thing .
What I was bought , but not perfect .
After I had paragoned that choice with what I was trying to do in the expectations .
The addition of options in life does not make people that increase the expectations that these are responding to options to the options of the same .
And that 's going to produce less sflick , even when results are good .
No one in the world of marketing if you 're connected .
Because if you know , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth is more to this .
" It was better when he was worse . " The reason it was better when he was worse , it was the worst when he was worse , it was even worse , you can met the surprises .
And the world in the world that we live in -- opulents , industrialized citizens with the expectancy of the perpective expectations -- the things are at the height of expectations .
You never have surprised to be surprised because your expectations , the myself is ingigantains .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse , " Yes , " Basse , " You want . "
I mean , small authobiographic moment -- which is really amazing and my wife is really stulot .
I couldn 't have to do better , I don 't have to do better ,
But it 's not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of the jeans that when you 're only the kind of jeans is that when you 're not satisfied , and you say , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " " " The answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do you do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a lot of jeans , and you ask you who is responsible , it 's the responsible , it 's extended to the responsible , is a clear that responsible is ,
You would have do better .
With hundreds of available varieties , there are no fit for the unsuccessful .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is worth , they feel inseven and they 're hard , they feel that they 're saying colate and give the colcolor to them .
In the last few years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- this wave of depression is that people have experiences because people have experiences because the standard of the depression of the depression of the depression of it is too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the collected is their bad .
So the final result is that we 're better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely false . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little choice is better than having it 's better than having it , but by this doesn 't get a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magical value . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been enough that we 've been doing by a piece of the level where the choices are improved .
Now , from the political point of view -- I 'm almost finished -- from political view , the name is the following .
What 's allows all this choice in industrial society is the wealth material .
There are many places in the world , and you know about it , where the problem is not they 're very choice .
The problem is that they have too poor too poor .
So the face of the face I 'm talking about is a while modern exclusive of modern , receive society .
And what it does to do is that , and the arrage is this : Steve Levitt talked about how those expensive and discovers to be inuseful . It 's a spring of money .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dispendious , it 's not that they 're just useful .
They 're also a deleteries .
They do worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows was reversed in the way that people have too much as a few possibility , it would be not only their life to improve , but also , our life .
That 's what economists call a paretan improvement .
A redistribution of the refined , it 's good at all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice in excess that you go back .
And to conclude , " You can become everything you want to become everything you want ,
You know , people who are culture , you 'll think , " What does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get it into a boat . "
" A castrated imagination , a limited vision of the world , "
and that 's what I 've interpreted that , at the beginning .
But then , I realized , I realized that that fish knowledge that fish knows .
Because the reality of fact is that if you eat for the boat , so that " all you can do , " you get not freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the bocket in a way that all you can diminuliitous sfetime .
You get the paralysis , and you 'll reduced well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too much , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the aswithout a few symbols is a recipe for infection and , for roine , for roine roine .
Thank you .
