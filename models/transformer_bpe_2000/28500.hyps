I showed this last year , I showed these slides to show that the glacial glacial , which for almost three million years had the size of the United States , is refted about 40 percent .
However , this subjective gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice .
The artical calots is , in a way , the heart of the global climate system .
You can expand of the sumer and you reverse .
The next slide is a quick fresh of the last 25 years .
The ice lost of lost are signed in red .
You see , they expand , they expand , they expand , they expand .
That 's the ice in winter , which is reveride .
You can see the cosidynamed ice , for five years or more , is like the blood , that 's like the blood , that 's like the blood here .
In 25 years , it 's been from this ,
This is a problem because the scale of the whole thing that the ground of ice the world around the ocean arctic where there are huge amount of coal conglacier , snake , they 're turning into the microbes .
I spect to the totality of the ttality of global atmosphert , that amount of global warming , that amount of global injumped this point of not return .
In some of some laghi labs in Alaska , the methane is already rebully rebulating the water .
The professoresse Katey Walter of Alaska of Alaska team was recently with a team bottom of the score .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You 're good .
A reason is that this termal environment that Greenland from the northern .
This is a glacial reme .
The brought her her levels .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the South of the Greenland .
If you want to know how the sal level of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the land , here is where you get the sea .
These corrate corrups are rapidly .
Adly the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the biggest block of the planet .
The month of the scientists have district that the balances of ice is in the negative , and that Antarctica , and that Antarctica , poor of some issues of the islands .
That is six meters of the hundred feet in Greenland .
On Himalayas , the third biggest block , you see new laghi , which few years ago were glacier .
From percent of the world population will recognize half of the water population .
Sulle Ande : this ice is the source of the water source of this city .
The brought is increased .
But when you diminuges , the same happens to the water .
In California the Sierra Nevada Sierra Nevada is diminuitous .
The backkkkkidney .
The predictions , as you read , are flew .
The growth of the world 's growing up to a remarkable car of the incends .
The environmental disasters are increasing out of the normal and without precedent .
Four times more number of years , in the last 30 years I 've been respect 75 .
This is a whole thing that 's about all insustainable .
If you look at it in historical context , if they can see the consequences .
In the last five years , we added 70 million tons of tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons of tons in the oceans every day .
Look attention the Eastern Pacific , from the Eastonian area , and on both the parts of the Indian subcontinent , where there is a sadical imately impoor of the oxygen oceans .
The major causes of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent of fossils .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the most emissions , together in China .
And he was proposed to build a lot of other central coal .
But we 're looking at a change of direction .
These are the annoullated projects in the last few years and some of alternatives of versus .
Everything , there 's a politics in our country .
The coal industries and oil industries have 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the coal of clean , which is a bone .
And that image of this picture was going to be --
I 'm going to be in the Natal Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion light-scories of carbon swalks .
And you 'd seen it on the news .
This is the biggest second flow of scories in America .
It happened around Natal .
The natalization of one of the coal industries was this .
Video : World Frosty the carbon is a guallegro and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's going to grow our economy .
Frosty the carbon is more and more published .
It 's a good price , adorable and workers are going to be .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest mineral society is Massey Coal . This is his amministrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : Al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima 's Proteition , and I launched two campaign .
This is a part of them , a part .
Video : Atore the COLergy , we see climate change climate change as a serious thing to our business .
So , our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a effort of public public and confused the truly of carbon .
In fact , coal is not shork .
We think it 's clean -- it 's also a good way .
So , you don 't preokay climate change .
Let 's do it .
Video : Atches , you know , you 've heard a lot of it .
So , let 's let 's go to a turn in a structure of the pattern of the coal .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noise , but this is the sound of the coal technology of clean technology .
The coal consumption is between master causes of global warming , but the night of the carbon .
You have a look at : this is the hate of the clean technology .
Al Gore : In the end of the national alternative issues is connects to economic issue and the national security .
Video : Compractice : The economy , national security , the national security .
The file that the flows all : our dependence of fossils , like the coaling and oil oil .
Now , but , there 's a new , a new , car solution for used .
Repower America : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A piano to reput America to work , make sure , make sure , and we make sure , to stop global warming .
And , it was , a solution that you can solve our problems .
Repower America . Scover more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : Compractice : It 's about reflip to America .
One of the fastest ways to get to dependence on the dependence of the comfortable that killed the planet .
What 's the future is here . As the future is here . I mean , a new net energy .
So , what 's two : Noves investment for burning jobs for retribes .
Compractice : America . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old African old African said , " If you want to go fast , go from the soles .
If you want to go away , you go together , "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
The year at TED I did an introduction on the LHC .
And I promise to add it to the car .
So here I am . And for those that the other time , there were no , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever -- 27 miles of circuster .
His task is to recreate the conditions that were less than a billion to the universe -- to 600 million to the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
This is just environment .
This is the car under Ginevra .
We 're pictures these mini-Big Bang Bang in the relationship .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- it 's 44 feet and has a diameter of 22 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building , so you can see the proportions .
The 10 September September year , we have the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was causes of immense to the control of the control .
It 's a picture of the first particles that had done all of the LHC , both of the LHC , both of course , with a LHC , and spread particles in the lads .
In other words , when we see that image 10 September , we knew the machine works , which is a great vitty .
I don 't know if this was to be exultate us , when someone went to Google and saw the page was this .
That means we had a cultural impact beyond that scientific impact .
It was a week after , there was a problem with the car , had to these dorries here -- these dorries sleep .
These files are 13,000 prints get when the machine works at the power of power .
Now , the technicians between you look at the bottom and say , " It 's not true . They 're too table . "
And instead can do that when they 're very cold slies are very cosidof becoming up .
So , at less 271 degree , a temperature , in the wore of the space between the stars , these files can bring that corporate .
In one of the guntures of the nveallew in the LHC , there was a fabrication of fabrication .
So the files are surrive , and the 13,000 prints of the electricity .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think these magnetets more than 20 tons , and that have been moved of about 30 centimeters .
They 're damaged about 50 magnetets .
We had to take them , what we had done .
We restinated them and adjusted and adjusted .
Now , they 're returning all of them to their place .
And the end of march the LHC will be again .
We 're going to accintroduced , and we expect to get data to july , and keep so our adventure to discovering what the morning for the morning of the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents reaccess the dibate of science and engineering in the science and engineering in frontier . It 's easy to confuture .
I think the fact that 's so difficult , I think it 's a very difficult of things like the LHC .
I 'd like to conclude with the words of a Inglens , Humphrey Davy Davy , which , I think , in defense of the inuses of the inuses of the involved of the puple was Michael Faraday , said , " Nient is a lot of human mind as the return that the ideas of science are definitive , that we don 't have any of the world 's new world-called " and the worldwighes , and that are not a whole whole whole whole whole whole word . "
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to rethink of when , children , you play with the morning .
And as you understand how to realize them and snake them , and move them , learning them and move , learning to think and solve problems capability to solve problems .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , as a information information inspired by our physical interaction with physical objects , and my conon Patts , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only cursor of the mouse of the digital polluty that we could have a little bit of the information with both hands on a desktop of the information with both hands ,
and we sistemard-pleasure ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computers is a big interactive computer interactive as a biscoscope .
In a few words , a Siftable computers is a big interactive computer interactive as a biscoscope .
You can move them with your hand , they can see , " in their own movement and they have a screen and a radio screen and a radio radio .
But most of them , I 'm physical objects , like the morning , you can move to simply further .
The Siftable is a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they get more physical , consciously , the other , and as they get more physical , consciously , as we 're going to be more physical , of how we move , we can explore new and fun interaction .
I 'll start with a simple example .
This Siftable is configurned to show video : if it 's in a direction , the video will raise like this , if you 're going to figure out the other side back .
These interactive ritrats are aware of the other .
If you 're interested in what they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they 're surrounded , and they can get a little bit of .
If they 're surrounded , and they can get a little bit of .
They have a lot of their movement and inclination .
We realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power of the data , for example of the data , for example , " to put " a color like it . "
In this case , we have three Siftable configurned as a seck of vernice and I can use them to the color in the middle , where they mised .
and I can use them to put them in the central color in that central , where they mix .
We can get too much , we can put a little bit of it .
They are also beautiful possibilities of learning , like languages , the mathematics and games where people can try and see the results where people can try and see the results of the results , and you can see the results of it .
Now , I 'm now --
This is a Fibonaces that I do with a equations of equations .
Here we have a game of words that is half of Scarabeo and Boggle .
And , basically , at all of the turn of a letter to every Siftable , Pratically , at every turn turn of a letter to every turn of the letter of the Siftable , and while certainly he 's control on a direction .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you get a new set of lectons and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
So here 's children came up to the Media Lab , I did so that they tried them and turned a video video .
They were very flied .
And one of the interesting things of this kind of application is that you have to give people a lot of education .
You just say , " So , " Compones of the words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's how other people that try it .
This is our young head head , right there .
It actually wanted to impact them .
They were only bring mors , for him .
Now , this is a interactive application of a interactive cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for the languages .
It can put new personics new characters in the scene , sold the Siften , and they 're going to be able to put up .
It can put new personics new characters in the scene , sold the Siften , and they 're going to be able to put up .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The Sun is smile .
David Merrill : Now he brought a track in the scene .
Video : The arancient treattor .
By work ! Yes !
So I school , I school , I school , and put them close to bring the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing your story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It 's a story with the final wind , and it can decide him how it comes .
DM : It 's a story with the final wind , and it can decide him how it comes .
Video : Volabs , gat .
DM : The last example I 've got time to show you is a tool , recently , to be able to figure , to figure out and execececk music .
It 's a tool , recently , recently , to sampling and exececures music .
The Siftable here , they 're going to be like base , based and the bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also be insert of these sounds in a sequence of the pleasure .
And it just fly to the touch a squence .
These are actually , you can control from the vive , like the reverbs and the filter .
I 'm going to a particular sound , and then including it .
And then there are the effects as time and fly , and fly , that we apply to the whole sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : DM : We 're going to put a base in two Siftable Siftable , " we 're going to a series , we add the base .
Now I put a line of bottom .
Video : DM : Now , I add some percussions --
Video : And I 'm going to put the philtrue of the battery , so I can control the effect of the view .
DM : DM : DM : I can fall the whole sequence of the whole sequence of time .
Video : And I 'm going to add the filter of the bottom of the flower to expression .
Video : DM : I can recombine the sequence . "
So I didn 't have to planning it , but I can improvise it , it 's more strange or more short .
And now , finally , I can sleep the entire sequence inclining to the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new interface men interface , and more more more more more than how our brain works .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this pattern , and also a few possibilities that we 're going to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to show you is that we 're going to get this new generation of project to interact with digital media , that will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writer .
I 'm to figure out books , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and my love the fasinner of my life .
And I don 't expect that can change .
But , I said , something particular happened in my life and in my career , which brought me to realibrate the whole thing with this work .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called " Manogy , Prega , Ama , " which , diversity , diversity of my precedented books , and it came a great sensational , herently , wildly , wildly , wildly , wildly , international .
And the result is that everywhere , now , people treat me as if I were condevicted .
It 's true -- condanned , convicted ,
They 're all going to me to be worried and say , " Don 't you fear to be able to do better ?
You don 't fear to continue to write for all life without more to be able to create a book that can important someone ? "
what can do to be ? "
It 's rassure , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a adolescent adolescent -- I was a writer .
I 'd go to meet the same reaction of the same reaction .
And people said , " Don 't temes , I don 't have success ?
Do you know , you know , the umiliation of the refected you ?
Do you know , you 're going to be able to do this for all life without there and die on a heart of a drive dreams with the douth of drive , with the floor of fallic floor of failure ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I 'm afraid of all of those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also fear of many other things that people could not have to have .
As the other things that are sentences .
But , as I think about that and I was going to write about what I thought , and I was going to be , why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's gone that anyone who has been expected by a work that you feel born to be switched by a work that you can do .
But what is there is so particular in the creative impress of the health care about health care to mental health care about mental health , in a way that other career do not ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemistry engineer and I don 't remember of one in his 40 years of activity where the was asked if she was asked to be engineer ?
And it was never -- that block of John , how do it would go ?
Does you know , you know ?
Onthesightly , chemical engineers , they don 't have certainly , in the chemical reputation of being alcost .
We have enough writers , we have enough this reputation , and not only creative writers , we have this reputation of being hustable mentally .
And you 're not going to look at the sad of the magnificent death of the magnificent minds that is just in the century , they died young and often for their hand .
And even those who are not suicipate data they 're really dissatisfaced by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , " I 've been killed to a little more . " A straight " more . " A extraordinary affermation about their life .
But we don 't buy cilly , when we feel that because we 've heard these things that we 've done done a lot of interior , we 've done , and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering is in a way , and that art , at the end , will will be in the anchscious .
And the question I want to take all to all the time is : you know , you know , what 's right ?
You 're good to do that , because he also looked at it from a centimeter distance to me , it 's not good for anything about this supposed .
I think it 's hate .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encourage our great creative minds to live .
And of course , I know , in my case -- in my case -- would be very dangerous to start the heading of the pleasure , I 'm in my career .
That is , you know , I 'm pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I 've got about 40 years .
I still have about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that anything write write about now , it will be judged by the world as the work that I did after my last book .
I 'm going to be square , because we 're all likely to be that my biggest success is the biggest myself .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads to a person to start to behind a person to start to behind the morning and I don 't want to do it .
I 'd like to keep to keep doing this work that I love .
So , the question is , how do it becomes , how ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflections , that the way to work to keep write is to create a psychological costruction , OK ?
I had to have a few way to find a security of security between me , which I 'm written , and my natural anxiety on which can get get to the scorphysical way , I was trying to look across the time , trying to find other society to see if they could have the best ideas and more healthy .
about how to help people create creative people to manage the inherent inherent people of creativity .
And that research a remarkable Great Rome and ancient .
I 'm going to drive because it gets back to circle and then back .
In the ancient Great and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity was that creativity was from men , OK ?
It was creativity of creativity was this spirit of the people who were sitting in the men , and unknown slightly and sharp .
The greenhouse called us spirits of creativity , " demons . "
Socrate , wonderfully , he created to have a demon demand that elevening wisdom .
Romani were the same idea , but they called that spirit species of spirit .
That 's great , because the Romanian , they really think that a genius were actually someone who was a little smart .
They had a genius was this sort of a divine that was actually living in the walls of a divine death , a little bit like the Dobby the elfo Dobby , and that came out of a little bit like the work of the crop of of that work .
It 's about -- here is the distance of -- that 's the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological costrained you from your work .
And everybody knew that was that it worked , right ?
So the artists were protected by certain things , like , for example , narcism , right ?
If your work was exceptional work was not evening , you could all have been helped by this , all of course they had been helped by this genius .
If your work work work , it was not all your work , right ?
They all knew that was your genius to be a hunable .
And so people han concept creativity in the West for a long time .
And then Renascivation came and everything changed , and it was born of this great idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe and mysteries and meant and more and flew space and flew space creatures that write by divinity .
This was the mainly of human rational and people started thinking that creativity was completely report of humanity .
And for the first time in history , you started to refer this or that artist as a rather than a person in a rather of a person .
And I 've got to say , I think it was a big herror .
I think that allow someone , a simple person to believe , like a recipient as the source , the essence and the source of all my divines , creative , unknown , and ethernal responsibility to the psychchches .
It 's like to someone to stay the sun .
Deform and distores completely the ego and creates all of these ingestilic expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pressure to adstroyed the artists in the past 500 years .
And , if that 's true , and I think that is , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and misty .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't square 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there is people in the audience that would sollevering scientific subjects that we have to be able to do the notion of , you know , you know , you know , you 're going to follow their projects .
You know , you know , I 'm going to convince you all about this .
But the question I 'd like to take is -- why not ?
Why not think about that way ?
Because more sense of everything that I 've ever heard to explain the exaspermany of the creative imprevebility of the process .
A process that , as anyone who ever ever tried to do something -- so , all of course , everybody here -- you know , you don 't buy .
And , in fact , it can sometimes sometimes it seems to be completely paranormal .
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poetesse Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but it was a poetesh for all life and told me that was a little bit of the life and told me that was in the Virginia , working out in the field , and he was hearing the landscape .
He said , she was like a fragorous of air .
And that was rotate to her from landscape .
He felt that was going to be , because he was so much a floor of it .
He knew to have a only thing to do about that and it was , " correct , " correct like a matta . "
And so it was back to home and came back to this poetry , and it wouldn 't have to make a piece of paper and a match fast , and a match fast , and a match fastern washed and sweet on the page .
Sometimes he couldn 't be fastonishing , so that it would run and run without get to the home and the poetry was rotates through and she would slow her and he would keep on a landscape , trying to , how she said , " another poet . "
And then there were those times -- this piece of time -- this piece of time , there were moments where it was almost losing , OK ?
So , it was running home and he was trying to the card and the poetry was going through , and he was a hyourself in , and then he said , that it was like , and then he said , " He was like you sleep with the other hand the stepping .
He was the poem from the tail and reput it in his body and reput it on the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be shown on the perfect page and it 's about the last word .
So when I felt that -- it 's a crazy , it 's exactly equal to my creative process .
I 'm not a creative process -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a mule , and my way to work is , and I wake up to the same orary every day and I 'll work and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go on on on .
But even I , in my head , I 've striped against that thing , sometimes .
And I 'm imagine that many of you the han fact .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source , I could not have honestly .
And what is that ?
And how can we relationate to it , but , rather , what do we don 't lose the head , but rather , what do you get to square saying ?
So , as I 'm going to be , the best example of Tom Waits , which I 've been interviewed to be a lot of a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of the articulate recontemporary , trying to control , to try to check these species of creative totally interized creative totally interized .
But then I invecked , and he turned out , and one day as he was driving on a fall in Los Angeles , changed all for him .
He was going to fast and all of a sent tracks , and all of a tiny of major , which comes into its head as it does the inspiration , and trackle , and the wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and it 's desider , but not how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a matrister .
So , it starts to feel this sort of an old anxiety growing in him , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'll remarriage by this song .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , they stop .
I 'll give the whole process and made something new .
And he just look at the sky and said , " Scuses , you can 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" You know , " Do you know , " Do you know ?
If you really want to be there , back to a more opposer moment when I can get care of you .
Otherwise , I save to important someone else today .
You go to disturban Leonard Cohen . "
And his process workers changed after this .
I don 't work , the work was still dark as well as a always .
But the process , and the weighten , and the fish was reef when he took genius , the genius of the genius that was going to fall back to the problems and flew back .
but it 's just about this peculiar , beautiful , beautiful collaboration in Tom and this strange thing that and external thing and external thing that was not Tom .
So , how I felt that story started changing a little bit even where I worked , and I was saved up .
This idea , I save me when I was writing " Manogy , Prega , Ama , " and fall in one of those cave dispersonally , where we 're working on something and we don 't start to think that 's going to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst books .
Not just bad , just the worst book ,
And I started thinking about gaining this project .
But then I remember Tom that was talking about the air and I tried to it .
So I got my face in the short and I recognize my commons to a vacuum of the room .
And I said to high voices , " Sords , what we 're going to know that if this book is not going to be interacted with my , no ?
Because as you see I 'm putting all I don 't have that .
So if you want it to be better , you have to present you and make your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do .
I 'm going to write to write the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to be recorded that I today , I 've been presented to do my part of the world , " Why is that , you know , it 's like , OK -- seat the deserts of the North Africa 's deserts , and music that they were sacred for hours of the middle , and the sacra .
And they were always magnific , because the balleras were professionals .
But every once , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists actually turned out .
And I know that I 'm talking about , because I know you all have seen , a throw performance like that .
It was like the time stopped , and the dancerin the dance of walked through a sort of a little bit of a balls , and it was not doing anything about different from the usually , but all of it was moving .
And in a suddenly , not appeared as a human .
But you accurate from the dierd and under illumined in the fire of the divinity .
And when this was , the people knew what was , they called him the people who knew what was , they call him with his name .
They congone the hands and started cancer , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God . "
That 's God , you know .
And he was a very nice nice -- when Morororrow the Spain , I got this habitude with them and pronce he changed the Soulh , Allah , Allah , the word , Allah , the role , " that you can still feel in the round or flamp .
In Spain , when a arten , a pain , " Allah , the rules , " Allah , " Allah , " Buh , " you know , " here , " you know , " -- a short of God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But , the problem is the day after the dancer , when you wake up and discover that are the 11 of the morning of Martedyes and discover that are the 11 of the morning of the Marteduts and discovered that they 're not .
It 's just a mortal with ginockrock , and maybe it will never get to that allow the high .
And maybe no one will square name of God still as it gets , and what has to do with his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painted recilizations to make in a creative life .
But perhaps not have to be so annote , if you can 't believe , you know , the most extraordinary aspects of your being being from yourself .
But you just believe that they 're going to you to be data from a unimaginable source of this squisite part of your life that you have to go to someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think it all changes .
And so I started thinking about , and I was sure , and it 's as a few months of the book that I was working on publish , I 'm going to publish soon , spented , and I was followed , and I was going to be able to follow my great success .
And what I had to continue to say when I feel elected elected by this is , not fear .
Don 't go . It 's only your work .
It 's required to your part , whatever it can be .
If your work work is dancing , bad .
If the divine , you know , you know , you know , I had to leave some kind of wonderful , for one moment through your effort , then you go , " On ! "
Otherwise , you do the same dance .
And " Ole ! " at yourself .
I think I was to teach it .
" Ole ! " at yourself , even for the humans , and tals tals tals to be able to present continues .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I 've been talking about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean and the discovery of new genes .
Now we 're starting a new pattern : we started digitalize biology and now to start to the biology and now to start to a new phase of biology , we 're entering a new phase of biology , design and synthesizing life .
We 've always tried to bring great questions .
" What is life ? " is a lot of biologues I think they 've been trying to understand vary .
We tried different approaches , reducending boundaries .
We 're digitalizing almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to go from the analogical world of the computer world .
Now , we 're asking life , we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest genitalium of the smallest genome that can autoreplicate into laboratory .
And we tried to reduce the ulterly small genome .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of the 100,000 of the 100,000 that I 'm here .
But when we go to his map metabolic , it 's relatively simple to the respect our .
I record , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one to the time , it 's very improbable that this can bring a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to provide that the only way to provide this cromodify to the components to bring the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the " Can we synthesize a chromosome ? "
Can the chemistry connecting these great molecules that we never have been able to create before we 've never been able to create before ?
And , in case , we can we have a cromosome chromosome ?
A chemistry is just a chemistry of chemistry material .
The speed with which we are able to digitalize life is growing exponential exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , rather prodiscuss rather slowly , but it 's improve .
And our most recent results of exponential curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process has require a lot of passages , beginning with a biothical review before we started the first experiments .
But we found that DNA synthesize that DNA is very difficult .
There are thousands of a thousands of car segments of DNA , of the length of the length of 30 to 50 letter and is a degenerative process : longer segment is longer , the more than the segment is , more error .
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these fragments and correct the errors .
And this was our first trying to be a digital attempt , to the digital information genome of Phi 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills kills .
We designed the fragments , we actually had the correction of errors and get a molecule of DNA , about 5,000 lective letter .
The interesting part is when we took this chemistry of chemistry material and we put it into the bacteria , the bacteria have started to read this genetic code and produced the viral particles .
The viral particles have been releft by the cell , are back and they 're back and destroyed the E. coli .
I 've been talking about recently with membrings of the oil industry , that they 're certainly compressed .
They repected more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can really build his hardware in biological system .
But we wanted to do the biggest things .
We wanted to build the whole cromosome of the bacteria .
They 're more than 580 miles of genetic code .
So we thought I 'd build it in seven in the size of the virus , so that we can change the casses of the components to understand what are the components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequenced this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard of a mistake for every 10 miles .
We found , resequency , 30 mistakes . If we used that original sequence of the original sequence we never had been able to do it .
One part of the process is designing longer segments that are overwhelming segments that are all the other segments of 50 letters to build a little bit more tiny working together .
We try to be a only one here .
You have read you read that we put that on the filigeting .
Think it like this : we have a genetic code on four letter : A , C , G and T.
Three of those reads men together codify about 20 amminoacids , and there is a specific order to share for every amount of lectankydo .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frareas , throw , thoughts .
What we did was the first first thing that was autographs to do .
Some of them were by the fact that it wasn 't poetry .
We designed these segments to just just just just to give them together .
There are enzymes that repair them and put them together .
And we started assemble to assemble parts , beginning with five to segments from five to segments , and a lot of 24 miles reading to be able to be able to make a 72 of the letters .
So , every step we produced these abundance in abundance , so that we 're trying to create a very very very robustood -- you 'll see a very robustood -- you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to do the process .
So , this seems to be the tabellon the tabellon of the basket .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 miles , more than 100 miles , they 're not going to be directly in the Elay .
You go to the modern limit of the modern biology .
So we looked at other mechanisms .
We knew to be a mechanism called recombination homologa , which is using biology to repair DNA can be able to put DNA segments .
Here 's a example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , it can absorb three million rad .
You can see in the superperhigh as the chromosom is .
In 12 hours -- 24 hours , it was before .
They have thousands of organisms that are able to do .
These organisms are completely .
They can live under a vacuum .
They 're absolutely certain life in space , and you move to find new water environments of water .
And in fact , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built by using these processes , just using the leveling of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments of the segments that we 've been doing .
The least assemble them authomatically .
This picture was not taken with a electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a great molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are photos that they cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publishing we 've done a little time ago .
They 're more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the biggest molecule of a defined structure that man ever created by the man .
It has a weight molecular weight to 300 million .
If we stood with a 10 carries without spaces , we would like 142 pages , it would just take this genetic code .
Now , how do we do that ? How do we do that ?
Of course , you love a virus is a game of guys .
It 's a little more complicated when they use the bacteria .
It 's also as simpler , when it 's ekariote as our : you can just extract the nucleus and put another , which is basically the clonation .
In the archaea , the archaea chromosome of cell , but we have recently demonstrate that we 're able to do a transplant chromosome of a chromosome of cell and activity .
We can have a cromosom participate from a microbial species .
The two are different as men from the men .
We have a few genes in more way that we could decide what choose to choose for this chromosome .
And then the skies with the environment in a way that proteins .
And when we put it in the cell in the cell was stupenditatoes -- the new cromosophisticatooes -- the new cromosom went into the cell .
And we started thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to spinheres more in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that a lot of species have added species have added a second or a third chromosom from a thousands of new tracks to that species .
So , who think about evolution as a gene , as a gene that modified doesn 't understand a lot of biology .
They are called the DNA .
The cromosome that was in the cell of the cell .
The cell cell cromosome that we put it .
And it 's expressed , and he recognized the other chromosom as an material , and we were returned with only the cell cell cell and the new cell cell cell .
it became became became became became .
And in a short leave of time , all the characteristics of a species , and it turned out of all of a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cell .
All the proteins are changed , membranes are changed , and when we read the equivalent genetic code exactly to what we 've been turned to what we 've been transfer .
Now , this may seem altering genetic , but we 're honey the software , we can change things in the way , in a lot of course ,
Now , I 've already explained that here is not talking about genesis -- but we 've been progress to three million years and a half evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian extended new species of this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's obvious when we think of our needs .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right for example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each other in 1946 , there are four years , there will be four .
We 're going to find problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicinals and a half billion people .
It will be more tough to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon , more than 30 billion bets of the olighbors .
That means percent million buses a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to reduce them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to hold the whole of CO2 of these materials that ends in the atmosphere .
And today , thank you to scientific discovery of the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they 're the components for the future .
The electronics industry only has a dozen of components , and you think how many different things came out .
Our limits here are related by biological reality and our imagination .
Now we have the techniques , thanks to these rapid methods of synthesization , able to create what we call the combatory .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million cromosomes a million cromosomes a day .
Think of this 20 million different genes or to try to get the processes of pushing and to get the processes to produce either eighth , new vaccines , and we can change , thank more biology , and create more biology molecular biology now .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for a chance to survive , chemistry or fuel , production of ethc vaccines .
This is a few software programmed by some software programmed to be able to seeds and design species to the computer .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly what the genetic code .
We 're going to be focused on the fuel of quarter .
You 've also seen that they also have to extract from the gray was a bad experiment .
We have a lot of second and third generation that will be enough to be on the gar , and it 's more than the value of the high value or different types of butanol .
But the only way biology can have a great impact without increasingly impact without increasingly the cost of food and limitar the availability to be able to transform CO2 in matter , so we 're working on to design cells that can get to the cluster that can get to the cost of this purpose , and we think we could have the first generation in about 18 months .
The solar light sunlight , but in our discoveries in the world , we found different metodds around the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the ocean , about 2500 feet of depth of the water temperature of the water .
They 're metane of CO2 using hydrogen molecular , as you know .
We 're trying to understand whether we can meet the CO2 , which can easily be transported by the way , convert that CO2 in the fuel , to drive this process .
So , we think , we might be able to caugentlemen question what the basic is life is Nice , versus -- we have the modest modest -- we have the modest about the whole oil industry .
Exactly . If you don 't do it from TED , where can you ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And also , we 're working for using the same methods to create instantaneous vaccines .
You 've seen this year with the influence , we 're always back to a year and a dollar in less when it 's going to find the wine ,
I think that this can change building combines combines in a lot of a lot of multiple .
So , here 's how the future could start to look like changing , now , the tree of evolution , acceling the synthetic evolution , archy , archatheians , and finally finally ekariote .
We 're so from the best people .
Our purpose is to be enough to live long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'm going to show you , the most quickly possible , some of the new technology that we brought to Microsoft , in the new technology that we 've taken a year ago exactly . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment in which you can interact is to local level that remote a huge amount of data .
So , we 're seeing a lot of digital gigabytal photographs with a sort of snailing , and a panoramic speed , disponing the images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the information is the amount of information that we see , how big these are collecting data or images .
Most of them are digital photographs , but this is a scanning scanning from the Bilibrary of Congressed , and reflip in the gressed 300 megaxel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that limits prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a book , example of data is not data .
This is Dickens of Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
So , to show you that it 's just a test and not images , we can do something like that , to make something like that , to make a real representation of the text , not a photo representation of the text , not a photo .
It could be a little artificial way to read a little electronic book .
I don 't have it .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and beautiful experience of a fire version of a fire version or a quotidian , which is for nature , which is a lot of a lot of half .
We have done something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We created a higher ads higher resolutionary -- much more higher than what you use in a normal publicity -- and we put you in the extra crowd .
If you want to see the carland of this automobile , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even the specific specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate limitations of space on the screen .
We hope that means that that it means to put up to the pop-up and other syncheries , not should be necessary .
Of course , the maping is one of the most obvious applications for this type of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if you don 't say that we have contributes to get in this camp .
These are all the streets in the USA survey stroke over a geodd picture of NASA .
So , we 're going to be something else .
This is actually seen from the web , you can go to the web ; you can go to the web .
It 's a project called Photosynth Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research interesting computers in Noah Snavort Snavority of Washington , with Steve Seitz Steve Seitz Seitz Seitz Seitz .
And it 's from the Web , gesture by Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this pattern of pattern , where we can go from a picture of experience and have this kind of experience .
But the space space of the images of the images here has actually a meaning .
The Candirect of the computer has recorded these pictures together , so that correspond to the real places , so that correspond to the real place in the real image of the Roccious Roccious canadesi-- they 're taken . So you see the elements of the Rocciose that are all the space of a slide-stable pattern , and these things are all space space .
I don 't know if I 've time to show you some other environment .
There are a lot more space space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data Nohhouse -- and this is from a previous prototype of Photosynnnthrown Photosynnnthrow that we 've actually gone out of this technology , the Photosynth . And it 's not necessarily evident . And it 's not necessarily , looking at the environments we put in the environments that we put in the site environments that we put in the site environments that we 've got in the site environments that we 've got to be .
We had to worry about the legal things and forward .
This is a reconstruction of the Notre Dame of Dame of you taken by Flickr . Baast Dame in Flickr , and you get images of types in the maglight-other fighting images in the short of the other arancions of the arancions that has discovery .
So , they 're all pictures taking Flickr , and they were all colleaged to be a space .
And it 's possible to navigate this way simple .
You know , I 'd never have thought about the end of the Microsoft .
It 's very gratifically to get this kind of accokle here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different types of different types of different phones of the phones in the phones , SLR , a significant number of meaning , put together in this environment .
And if I can try to be able to look for those strange .
And a lot of them are blocks , etc .
You have a few of here here is a series of photographs -- here it .
This is a Notre Notre Dame recorrectly correctly .
We can go from the poster to the vision of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do with social environment . This is now taking data from the ential memory of how the ground looks like the earth , from visual view -- and you 're all of those data together .
All those photos are related together , more than the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the earth that emerges .
Think of this as a Stephen Lawler 's work on Earth .
It 's something that 's growing in complexity as people are using it , and the people who use it , and the vantages to the use .
Their photos are marced with the meanings of other people .
If someone is the idea of the idea of the data , and I had all these saying , my photo Notre Dame of the COs Dame , you know , you know , I can use it as a drug of all of these data , and I can use it as a social experience of space , in that metaphed , and have a social experience of a cross-moot-moed social experience of cross-mobile in the cross-mobile of red red red cross-moed cross-mooth .
Of course , a consequence of this are virtual models of all interesting , in the land of any interesting part of the earth , you know , not just as a satellite images and satellite images , and similar images , but from the collective memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software is going to us to do is that a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs , all shared photographs , everybody in the world will be basically linked together ?
BAA : Yes . What 's doing is basically discovering .
It 's creating hyperlinks , if you want , you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the basis to the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think of the city of the semantic information that many of these images are possible .
As you get a research of images on the Web , you digits , and the text page on the web page has a lot of information about the pictures .
Now , what if that is that pictures you have to all your pictures ?
So , the amount of interconnection and semantic interconnection and the amount of wealth that is really huge . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible . It 's really incredible .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pilefer , when you travels and one of the research of the etnographics of who didn 't forget anti-traditions , between the wind , the past wind , the wind of the wind , you drive the rain , ddle , drive in the footage , drighting plants .
And , Basti , the Jaguar travel even over the Lattea , or that the Inuit 's still travel , or that the Inuit are still meaningful , or Himalayas , the buddddans are still going to remember the importance of the Dharma , to remember the importance of the world , and that the idea that the world in which we live not exist in any sense , but it 's just a model of reality . But it 's just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of adaptations that our adaptations has done , well or a lot of generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
We all hidden . We all try .
We are subjects of the beginning of the initiation .
We need to deal with the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprising and we 're going to get to drid .
We all have a art .
What it 's the rhythm is particular song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they 're the Penan forest Borneo , or the following of Haiti , or the Haiti of the Haiti , or the Borary Borary Kaisut in Kenya , or the Curch of the Ande , or a cammouth of the Sahara .
And he was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a yak of the gap of the Qomolanger , on the Everest Everest , the world 's 's mother of the world .
All of these populations teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of music in the world .
And , if you reflect a second , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
So , with , the miridge of cultures of the world 's cultures of spiritual life and cultural life that we have the planet and is important for the well-being of the planet as the world as the ragela of biological renature .
And you can think about this cultural ragnature as a hetnosphere and you can define the ethnosphere , the total sum of all the concepts , dreams , mites , inspiration , ideas , intuitions , inspiration , inspiration , intuitions , inspiration ,
The etnosphere is the patrimony of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in how we can be in how to species .
And because the biosphere was free consumed by the way , as a lot of a lot of standing and purpose much more .
No biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent of all species was or is on the hord of the extinction of the extinction of the biological diversity -- and it 's not even closed to the world 's most optimistraight in the most optimistic diversity -- that of the world 's cultural diversity .
The index of that is , of course , the language of the languistic .
When you 're born , there were 6,000 languages on this planet .
One language is not only by a vocabulary vocabulary or a series of rules .
One language is the shake of the human spirit .
It 's the middle of which the animal of all culture is in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a crazy , a thinking of spiritual possibility .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we 're here sitting in Monterey , at least half of the ears is not ssurroundry in the ears of children .
They 're not teaching kids , which means , unless you won 't truly , that are already dead .
What 's more sad than the sad to be the silence , of being the last to talk to a language , not having to be the wisdom of wisdom or anancient promise the wisdom of the children ?
This report was the state of some of the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , a holder , and a muore with it in the last syllables of the last syllabe of the last syllables of a hang .
And I know somebody to say , " Don 't it ?
The world would not be a better place if we talk about all the same language ? " Well , we 're talking about all yoruba . We talk about yorbit .
Let 's talk kogi .
You will cover a tract of what it means not to talk about your language .
I 'd like to do you a journey through the labels --
a little journey in the ethnosphere to give you a little bit of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of existing really different ways of existing .
So let 's take for example , Barasana , Amazon Amazon , the popular popular anaconda , which creats the anaconda of the sacres of the walls of the sacres of the sacres of the sacres of the sacres of the sacres of the sacres of the sacres of the sacres of the sacres of the sacres of the sacres of the sacres of the sacres of the sacres of the sacres of the sacres of the walong of the walls of the walong of the wal
It 's a popular that is not able to distinguish the blue blue , because it 's time , it 's identified in the time , the forest population , where the popular the population 's time .
They have a strange language and a matrimonic rule , called " language of the language . " You have a different language . "
All of this radical in the Mitological past , yet the particularity is that in these extremendous families where they 're talking about six , or seven language of the matrimons of the matrimons .
They 're limitate to listening and then start to talk to .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Wadow of Ecuador , a population that has had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have tried to a factor of a factor .
They did never have been taking from the photographed that they had never seen , that this population population , forest that this population population had never seen that this popular popular forest .
They gave the photographs , they spent the research of a shape or a figure and , not by the way , they have concluded that they were treated with the square , and they killed the five missionaries with the lance .
But the Waorani killed only killed strangers .
They killed in their own .
The 54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We were repected to eight generations and we found two cases of death and when we style to know , they 've been able to know , they 've been invited with , and then they were killed to be .
The crawings were able to recognize the urina animal from 40 steps and to recognize it .
In the first ' 80s , I was assigned a very interesting task when my Harvard 's professor , I asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti to Haiti to me in the base society of Duvalier and Tonton Macocoues , and impossesser in Macouches , and impossessor I used to get the zoombird .
So , to give a sense of miraculous miraculous , I should have to understand the Vodoun culture , that Vooodoo is not magnitude .
It 's pretty much of a complex metaphysical vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to say , the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianesimum , Islam , Buddddism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious field . And instead of these religious concepts . And instead of these religious concepts of these religious concepts that we have a lot of profound tragic concepts of tragic tragic tragic tragic concepts .
What makes the voodoo is the nice of life and death .
So , you know , the people are doing the spirits .
The spirits can be invited by Great Acqua , they respond to the dance of the dance and replacing temporary aneously , in a way that for a short across the vive .
So , the voodooists are saying , " You 're going to talk about God .
We say in the temple and divention , we 're going to be . "
And from the moment you 're going to drit you that you 're driving you , how can you do the bad ?
So you 're going to these incredible events : following voodoo in state of trance that touch of the square unable to a rather strong demonstration of the body that 's mind when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme .
And all the popular popular that I lived the most extraordinary are the Kogi Nevada de Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta , in Colombia .
It takes of the ancivilization of the civilization planned on the planure of Colombic planned in the conquirt of the conquister , the population population was that you 're going to the caraibage .
In a drug drug , this popular popular , this popular was never conquirt by the spagnolious .
And so , they 're governed by a clero , but their formation is very extraordinary .
The young people followed by the families to three or four years , and live secregated in a world that made good and sharp of the base of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice for 18 years .
Two of nine years of the nine years of repair that they 're going to reproduce the nine months of the glad of the mother , are now metaphorically in the user of Great Mother .
So , all of time , they come to the values of their society , values that they predict that their predict and just their predict and their predict , they keep the cosmic balance -- or to say the ecological balance .
At the term of this incredible beginning , they 're sudden , and they 're improvise , and in the age of 18 , they see a high . And in that accounterness of the first cut , when the sun , the clay valley , all the valley of behind , all of the beautiful landscape . The predict does it behind . The prete is a step of the behind . The prete behind the ground behind of the first time . The pread , and it . The pread of the works of the first of this incredible initiation of the first of the cut .
" Would you say , " As I said .
It 's amazing . Now it 's to you protect it . "
They 're called the largest brothers and say that we , we 're brothers , we are the colate of the world .
This level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about indeed populations and environment , and the environment , and the old story of the noble self-vable , which is a razy concept in its simplicity or perhaps , we say that these populations are closer to the Earth .
The Ingenes are not feeling of indebull .
There is no space for these things in the malaries of the disease of the Aststans or the Tibet , but thanks to the time and the rites , they created a mystical measurements of the Earth 's known up to a very subtle of the war that the Earth can only live closer : the concept that the Earth can only live in the knowledge .
What does that mean ?
That 's a guy that a boy of Ande that grows the mountain Apu that mountain Apu that he will drit his destiny will be a different destiny and will have a different reportion of the mountain , and it will be different .
That 's the dimora of a spirit or a mineral cear is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that define is the metaphor , the natural world .
I grew up in the forest of the Britannica Columbia Britannica creding that forest to be cut .
And what I realized is a different from my friends Kwakiutl that they believe that the forest are the Hukuk and the drive of the Hukuk and the drug downballoon and the dog downorth of the world , spirits , spirits that are in the north of the world , spirits .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of them sensationship . We take this piece of plant sensitive .
I took this picture to open in the northern Amazon the nordoctor .
And you 'd have heard about the ayahuasks , the most powerful psycholder such repertoilet sciamanic sciamanic repertoilet sciamount of you have heard of the sciamount of you have heard of the sciamount of you have heard about the sciamount of you have heard of the sciamount of you have heard of the sciamoundly pitches .
What makes the ayahuasks the ayahuasks is not the potential of the sustainance , but its elaboration . It 's composed by two elements .
On a one side , this liana lines that contains a series of quick quick , harmine and harmful , sliana , slightly hallucinogens .
I mean , you can get the only plant that we have a blue that altering a little bit of consciousness , but it 's mixed with the leaves of a coffee of the coffee , Psychotridis sviridis .
This plant is saddress striptamine , very similar serotonin the methoxylen-five , methoxylthoxypamine .
If you ever see the Yanomami , you 're going to see the naked the sustaff that make a different set of species , anchy has contains methoxyltryltrystics .
And then , polve on the naked is a little bit like being disappeared by a fire smoke of wods and landing on a sea of electricity . It 's not creates a destroke of of electricity .
I had often , I often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who waiting the psychedelic was in the 1930 in Mexico .
And my thesis , you can 't be classify , you can 't be able to be . because if you 're not told , you can 't tell any of being hallucinated . And so they can 't be halluckin . They can 't be horly horly because they 're money are money from a nice that you are naturally in the intestine that you 're naturally in the inossize .
It 's possible to be absudden if you 're just a little bit of chemicals that money the MAO .
Now , is the beautiful : the quote , the quote of MAO , the same kind of the same kind of need to be able to the tripamine tripamine . The question is that we have two of the soughtful , as they do these popular popular swasn 't , but if you combine two of the souldn 't be , but that if you combine , you can fighting a lot of parts of the parts of the som of the parts ?
We use the great euphy of proof and error , that can reveal .
But if we ask the Indians , they 're going to say , " The plants are talking . "
What does that mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of ayahuasks , which distingue that we 're going to our eyes from the forest , and that our eyes would be in the same species .
If we ask him how they 're going to be saying , " I thought of plants , " I thought of plants , " I said , " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take 17 variety in a night of lunder , and each night to a different tone .
And that 's not sleep to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that contt the stami stami .
Now , , [ the problem is that the problem is that even those who have heart heart of the indegenes are pittoreses , but in some way , you 're sitting to the margins of history in our real world , and it 's pass .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it will not reminded for his wars or innovation , but rather than the technologic , but rather like the was where we were stopped and we have hurt activally or accepted the destruction of the biological diversity of the planet . Now the problem isn 't the problem .
All cultures through the secoli have been involved in a dance for new life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux didn 't stopped to be Sioux when they put out of the arc and flip as American have not stopped to be American have been American and mess .
It 's not the change or technology that they minaccount the integrity of ethnosphere .
The during of the domination .
And if you look at the world , you 'll find that these are not cultures are cultures of disappears .
They 're living creatures and dynamics are creatures out of identific forces that go beyond their ability to adaptation .
And that 's the disboscaring in the patria of the Penan --
a popular popular Sarak , in the Sarak , in the Southeast , a popular popular in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to the servitch and prostitution on the rive of the rivers , where you can see the river the river 's rive . It seems to be able to take a Borneo in the Merian Cinese Merian Cinese Merian Cinese Meries , where the navi navi navels the horizonable ,
To you get the standing stand the wood is to the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are the disease of the golder .
If we 're going to move on the mountains of the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of political domination .
As you will know the genocide , the physical extinction of a popular popular , but the ethnocide , the ethnocide destruction of life , not only is conditions , but it 's address , not only fall in the certain environments , because it 's it makes the strategy of development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet of the Tibet , until you 're part of the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in China in the West Tibet Southeast , through Tibet suouth , from Lhasa with a young , but only came to Lhasa , I understand what we have behind the statistics that we feel about .
6,000 sacres sacres sacres in the polvements and cends .
1.2 million people killed by the military Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical to Panchen Lama .
That means that it was killed to the template of Chinese invasion .
And the store was with Sua Santity of Santity during the diaspora that brought the popular in Nepal .
His mother was impresoned and his collightful was to be rich .
It was born of the age of two years , hidden in the age of two years hidden under his gonna because he could not live in him .
The sister , who did the same , was in reeducation .
One day , he walked up a day , a moment of Mao and , for this transgression , was meside the jumped , was the properties of seven years .
The Tibet of the Tibet can be unsuch , but it spirit of the population is from the population .
And then , all of it , all you reduced to a choice .
We want to live in the world monocromatic world or we want to acght the policicromate world 's world 's policymatic ?
The great anthropologists Margaret Mead , before he die was that , in our go to this love of the world , we 're going to see the world , not only see the whole glad of human imagination of human imagination , but we 'll have a limitation of human imagination , but one day we 're going to swake up from a sone-others .
And it 's a lot of remember that our species is there for 60,000 years .
The Neolitical Revolution , who gave us the agriculture , which has made us to the seed cult of the seed cult of the challenging of the sler of the sler , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industrialized has been 300 years .
That shares that we don 't suggests that we have the answers to all the challenge that we 're going to deal with millenny to come .
When these miric cultures of the world is asked what it means to be human , they 're asked to be human , they 're responding with 10,000 different voices .
And that 's in these responses that we all risky the chance to be what we are : a species that has to be what we are : a species that have to make all the people and all the garden yards can be truly . And there are great moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the northern extremendous photograph of Baffin , when I went to hunt of the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , I told , Olaya , I told the great story of his grandfather .
The government canady was not always gentle with the Inuit and in the 1950s to stay our sought-to-1950s to be slightly .
The grandfather of this man refected to go .
The family , teaching family , I took him all the arms , and all of his attitude .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't have the cold , they exploit .
The batts of the sledries in origin were fish .
The grandfather of this man didn 't intimise by the arctic night or the library that they were drive .
It 's gained off , it 's calculate the skin skin and defected in your hand . When the I did the pheces of his own hand . When I did the I did I have been congelated , and they 're congelated , and they 're working on a lama .
He spraised on the door of this cut and when I became solid , he killed a dog .
He waiting and created a brid , with the house of the slethin , and it 's created another dog , and it 's disappeared on the banknake , and it 's disappeared on the banker .
We want to talk about cavarsely with nothing ? " And that , in different ways , in different ways , [ Apaplausi ] is the symbol of the resilience of the world 's population .
In the 1999 government canader the canachieved Inuit , the total control of a larger area of the biggest California and Texas the Maybe together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunut .
It 's a independent . They 're all going to be able to do all the minerary resources .
One of a splendido of how a natione-state can remember with his population .
And , finally , I think it 's rather obvious to at least who of us was in these remote zones of the planet , it 's not remote remote they 're not remote remote .
For someone is house .
They represent human imagination that are humans that are going to the days . And for us all , the dreams of these children , as the dreams of our children , become part of our children , become part of the geographs of hope .
And finally , we 're in National Geographic , we are convinced that politicians will never get to nothing .
We think polemiics --
[ Applausi ] they 're not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the world , and maybe we 're the best institution of the world . Every month of our website . Every month of our site .
156 countries translate our television canal television .
Our revilians are laughts by millions of people .
Our work is travel to bring our public place to bring our public places , and we have to get cut out of how they 're going to be able to cut our public . They 're going to be able to get the central revealicle of the world , to be able to be in the world 's world 's most of exists . And multiculticultural world .
where the wisdom of all popular popular wisdom .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some of things I written in this book that I hope you 've been heard and try to evidence some of links , in case , you know , you know ,
I 'd like to start with what I call " the dogen officer . "
The official dogen official dogen thing ?
The dogen official dogen of all industrial society . The dogen dogen dogen : " If we want to massive wealth the well-being of our citizens . "
The reason is , from a side , in the fact that freedom is in itself a value , it 's precious , useful , essential for humans .
On the other is that if we 're free , each of us can act for all of us can act for all that we 're going to do all the way that we 're going to do all the name .
The way to massimilar to the freedom is massive .
More people have , more choices , more are free , and more is their liberty , the major of the well-being .
This , I think , is so deeply radicated in society that no one would have to put it in the society .
And it 's also deeply radicated in our lives .
I 'm going to show you a few examples of what progress possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly great .
I 'm a simple note about condition for insalt .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without content 10 varieties of olive oil and 12 acks of the holive of the holive of the world 's constantly constantly constantly that nobody of 175 of proned .
Here is what supermarket .
And then you go to the electronics store on the store of the stereo stereo CD , radio , plag , radio , plag , piag .
And in this single negotid of electronics , there 's a great number of components .
We can make six million and a half million combinations using the components that there are only a negoties .
You have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Other the camps : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a little little little little little little baby , you could get all the phone services that they were forced by mom Bell .
And they were doing the telephone , you didn 't buy it .
One of that , one of that , in the other , was that the telephone has never break .
These days are gone .
Now , we have a variety of telephones , especially in the cell phones .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , cut of the nose , and foreign crowd , and foreign the kkkey .
If you don 't have seen it in the store in the store , you 're going to be able to get .
And what 's finally happens is that people enters are in the store and does this question . And you know , what is the answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do it too much .
So , in other things of life that are much more important than the aques of the philosion of choice .
Audge healthcare : it doesn 't happen in the United States that you go to the United States and the doctor , what you have to do .
Instead , I walked out of the doctor , and the doctor says , " Okay , we could do A , or B " As these benefits and these saughter " A " B : What 's the " Bray , " B : What do you want to do ? "
You say , " Does , what would I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks , and B has these benefits . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you 're rebuts , " Does if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not like . "
The result of the result of the malate , expression that makes it seem to look like a beautiful thing .
But it 's actually not a move the weight and responsibility to get decisions from someone who knows the doctor , to someone else knows -- and it 's not -- and it 's almost certainly , it 's not in the ideal condition to make decisions of the patient .
There 's a huge marketing products , direct people , and you , that if you think , it doesn 't have any sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why publishing them ?
The answer is that they want to doctor , we call the doctor for asking him to make the recipe .
Something that 's fundamental as it is our identity of the choice , as you see in this vision , " We don 't want to force kids . They don 't want to be able to be . They 're going to ceat the right time . " We have to get more identity .
And we can reinventing how many times we get us .
That means that every morning , at the time , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
I 'm going to be a very good time , and marriage , a common , a time , it was that we had a mostly possible , and it was that they were able to be able to .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not what to do after .
And it 's really about it .
I teach very smart students , and I 'm going to be able to do a time .
And it 's not because they 're less brilligent , not because they 're less diligent .
but why are I asked , I mean , I 'm going to ask , " Do I have to spoke or not ? "
" Would I be sposed to spoken ? I have to think before or the career ? "
They 're interrogative interrogative .
And they 're trying to answer to these questions , even though this implic implic , and you can 't get a good vote to my own sea beautiful vote to my own execame .
And they have to do that . They 're important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl , the technology allows us to work every minute , every day , every day , from the angle of the planet , transpent of the planet , transpent of the planet , transpent of the planet , transpent of the world , except for the Hotel Randoll .
And in parently , there 's a angle , and I 'm not going to tell you , where the WiFi works .
I don 't say , because I want to use it .
What means , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work ? It 's continually decide , if we 're going to decide , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son and play with the cell phone in a cell , the Blackberry in the other , and the notea , the notetea , guy on the gineery .
And even though they 're all sorts of minute that we see our son , we 're also asking the game , we 're also asking , " I 've been asking , " I mean , " I 've been asking to say , " I mean , I 've also , " I 've got to answer to this called ? "
" I have to say , " I have this email ? I have this letter ? "
And even when the answer is no , " that makes the experience of your child , very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the things , we look at , little things , and life , things of life , life is a question of choices .
Obvive the world was this : Obught , there were some possibilities , but it was not a question of choice .
The world today is a slide of this : The dilemma is , " Is it a slide thing , or negative ? "
The answer is , Should it be .
The positive slives them all , so I 'm going to talk about the negative ones .
All this choice company two two effects of people .
The first one , paradoxally , is that produces instead of liberation .
With a lot of options of the choose to choose , becomes very difficult to do .
I give you a meaning you : a study of volunteer pleasure .
A colleagues had access to Vanic data , the gigantic society of the source society of the fundamental clients of the fundamental standard .
What she found out is that for every 10 solutions that are offered to more , the percentage of adesion , the lower of two percent .
With 50 source of offered , there 's 10 percent adesions than adesions when they 're available . Why ?
Because with 50 source of the bottom of which choose , is maledly difficult decide , and the choice is remainly hard to the questions .
And I 'm asking , and I 'm asking , questions , and of course , questions , and of course , I never get .
You know , it doesn 't mean that means that these workers are going to mangained food for dogs because they 're not going to say that the decision is that they 're losing the decision is so hating the funding is so hating the fundamental complementary of work .
Not to participating , they 're losing to five to 1,000 dollars for the year from work , which would be baby to truly be .
So , the paralysis a consequence of the choice .
And I think it makes the world like this .
" And finally , " by the ethernity : ketchup , senapes or maionese ? "
You want to take the right decision , if it 's the ethernity , is that ?
You don 't want to choose the bottom , and you don 't want to choose the wrong .
So this is the effect . The second one is that we also , if we can avoid the paralysis and do a choice , we 're less satisfacts from the result of how we would choose .
And this for different reasons .
One of those is that with many conditions that you would have been to do a lot of them , and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine you would have a different choice that would be better . And what 's going on is that the alternative imagined us , you can imagine us the crowd , and reduce the recovery of the conversation . And the recognize it fresh ,
And even when it was a great decision .
More choice , there are , easier is easy to be dispilepleasure of any detail .
And also , there is what economists are constantly opportunity .
Dan Gilbert asks very well as a value that we 're going to things to do with things about what we 're in the front of the things that we compared .
So , when there are a lot of options , it 's easy to represent the characters of the alternatives , and be less unsatisfacts and be less unsatisfacts of the option that is choice .
Here 's a example . I school with all those who are not New York .
But that 's what you 're probably thinking .
There 's this couple to the Hamptons .
A place of luser .
It 's beavailed . Otday . It 's all about them .
Nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , malth , malth , it 's Augly . "
" All my neighbors to Manhattan are away . "
" I could talk to right in front of home . "
And it 's pass two weeks , by the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the chance of parking parking things where it wants .
The constood of the satisfy opportunity for what we , even when the choice was excellent .
And more are the options that we have to look at , more the characteristics that will be able to be against how expensive opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things .
We talk about the moment , and maybe of the llowly .
But the most important point is that anything you 're choose , you 're choose to do not do the other .
The things that we don 't choose are active attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : it 's a growing of expectations .
I tried to my skin skin bought a new jeans .
I can almost always jeans .
And once the jeans were just a guys , buying them and vestivestivestivestivestivestivestivan , and they were saying a living of times , they started to go well .
So , I went to buy a new when those old were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The commit said , " Li wants to fit , easfit , relaxed fit ? "
And he wants to the cernightnerrows ? " Stonewashed or " ached ?
" Does you want to be strapped ? "
" Sotto them , " Home want to the blaw , " Continured to elenenenenenenenenenencare .
I was sitting , and after a little bit , I was able to say , " I want the type of , " I want to say , " I want to be , " I tried to all the jeans , and then I came out of the jeans , then I used to go out , and then the best pair of jeans that I 've ever had .
It was the massive . I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was going to worse is that with all the other things that choice the waites were high , jeans had to be perfect .
I was waiting , I was waiting . I didn 't expect anything excited when it was there was only a kind of , but when it was in 100 different , and I was like , but when I saw 100 different .
What I was I bought was good , but not perfect .
And after I had compared that choice with what I was trying to do with what I was trying to do with the expectations .
The addition of the people in life of people do not make that are the expectations that are responded to the options of the options .
And this will produce less satisfy , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing for it .
Because if they knew , you would not know what I 'm talking about .
The truth more to this .
" You 'd better when he was worse , " The reason he was going to be better when he was worse , he was going to be able to meet the surprised .
And the world in the world that we live in -- opulents , industrialized citizens with the expection of the perfefeature -- the massive we can hope is that the things are at the altitude .
You never have surprised pleasure because your expectations , the myself is ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you are -- that 's Basse , " Yes , " Well , " Yes , you want . "
I mean , small autobiographical moment -- that I 'm really sposed and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't have to do better , I 'm not accounted .
But , it 's not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of the jeans , and it 's only what you are satisfaces that you are not satisfacts , and you ask you , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " The answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What could I do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a pattern of jeans , and you ask you who is the responsible , it 's as a clear that responsible for you .
You might have to do better .
With hundreds of available variety , there are no excuses for the unsuccess .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is , they 're going to be in , they 're going to be able to do and give the hit to the same .
In the last years , the depression of the depression of the industrialized world .
I think a factor of meaning -- I don 't , but important -- of this honate is that the people have to have the world 's experiences because the standards are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation of them are thinking that the colses is their own .
So the end of the end of the end is that we 're better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogen , what we all get for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not true .
There is no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than haven 't affect it , but it doesn 't have a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magical value . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been on a piece of the level in which choices are better than the choice of life .
Now , from the political point of view -- I almost finished -- from political view , the nocle is the following .
What we 're all going to be all this choice in industrial society is the material .
There are many places in the world , and you know about it , where the problem is not that they too much choice .
The problem is that they 're too a little bit too little .
So the face of the face that I 'm talking about is a sick of modern modern , reminded society .
And what he does to be , and the arrand is this : Steve Levitt talked about how those expensive and discovers for bats are unning . It 's a short of money .
I mean , that these choices , complicated and dispendious , it 's not just unuseful .
They 're addictation of the labels .
They 're going to be worse or worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows that was going to be able to do that where people have too much chance , it would not only be their lives , it would be able to improve , but also our own life .
This is what economists call a paretian improvement .
A redistribution of the redistribution is good at all -- not only to the poor -- because of this choice , in excess that we 're going to get us .
So , let 's just just get to be , you can get all of what you want , "
You , people of culture , you 're going to think , " What does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get to a wind . "
" A castrated imagination , a limitation of the world --
And I 've interpreted this , I 've interpreted like this , at the beginning .
But then , I realized that , instead , I realized that weight the length of the length .
Because the reality of fact is , if you mand to me the bocks , so that , " all you can 't get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you pousehold the bocket so that all get you can diminusual sfetime .
You get the paralysis , and you can reduced the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost of course , too much clear , maybe even fish , and sure for us .
But the asn 't a few symboard is a recipe of the infecity and , for the roin .
Thank you for heart .
