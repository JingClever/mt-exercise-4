I showed this year I showed these slides to demonstrate that the glacial calots , which for almost three million years had the size of 48 States continental , it 's reply 40 percent .
But this subjects this subjects the problem because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice .
The articulty glacial calots is , in a way , the heart of the global climate system .
It 's expanding into the winter and you get summmer .
The next slide is going to be a fastonishing on the last 25 years .
The ice lots are driven in red .
As you see , they expand the blue .
That 's the ice in winter , which is remain inside .
You can see that the ice ice ice ice ice , five years , it 's five years or more , is like the blood , which is like blood , which is from the body .
In 25 years , it 's been so ,
This is a problem because the scale is the interest in the arction of the arctic around the ocean , where there are enormous quantities of coal congls that , sitting , the leap , the leap are turned into microbes .
I reply to the totality of the atmospherical inquaring , that quantities could doubling , super-to-scale point .
In some laghi lay in Alaska , the methane is already reblinking out of water .
The professoresse Katey Walter of Alaska 's bottom of Alaska team took a team took a team clearly lay up a team .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : That 's good . The question is if we 're going to be .
A reason is that this thermal exchange is that Greenland from the northern North .
This is a glacial river .
The brought her never had to get to similar levels .
This is Kangerlussuaq in the Southwest , in the West Greenland .
If you want to know how the level of the sea level of the ice , the melting of the sea , here is where it reaches the sea .
These corrups are increasing rapidly .
The other side of the planet : Antarctica , the biggest block of the planet .
The month last month have clear scientists have clearly , that the ice of the ice is in negative , and that Antarctica , which poor some submarine islands , poor some submarine islands is particularly fastern .
It 's six meters of the level of the himself as Greenland .
On Himalayas , the third biggest block , you see the biggest block .
40 percent of the world 's population will be half the water in the slectly water from the melting .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the tails of the city .
The brought it is increased .
But when it diminies , the same happens to be the same happening in the water .
In California , the Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The idrical backkkils are in the crisis .
The predictions , as you read , they 're graves .
The growth secure increasing the world 's crazy to the incends .
The environmental disasters are increasing out of the normal and without precedented .
Four times more number of the number of the last 30 years I repect 75 .
This is a whole thing that 's an unsustainable .
If you look at it in the historical consequences .
In the last five years we added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look attentially the area of the Pacific , the American , in the east , the American west , and both the west , and both the parts of the subcontinent , where there 's a radical impoor of oxygen in the oceans .
The major causes global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossil combustic combustic combustic combustic combustic combustic combustiable .
The oil is a problem , and carbon is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with the more emissions , together to China .
And it was to build a lot of other central carbon dioxion .
But we 're seeing a change of direction .
These are announcuts in the last few years and some proposes of alternative .
And so , there 's a politics fight in our country .
The coal industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year for promoting coal , which is a cleaning , which is a oxious .
I remember something that was going to be --
I 'm Natal , in Tennessee , where I live , there was a third of 3.8 billion liters .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second largest flow of scories in America .
It happened around the Natal .
The nature of the nature of one of the coal industries was this .
Video : Brosty the copy is a tremendous and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it grow our economy .
Frosty carbon is more and more published .
It 's good price , adorable , and the workers keep the styptill .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The largest ministrator society is Massey Coal . This is his amministrator .
Don Blankenship : Don Blankenship : I 'm clear -- I 'm not going to be talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alance for the Clima 's Proteition , it 's two campaign two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Atter : Ate COLergy see the climate change as a serious threat to our business .
So , our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a effort to make public and confused truth and confused truth and confused in the carbon .
In fact , coal is not sports .
We think it 's cleaned -- it 's also good , it 's a good promote .
So not preodcupateves of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Atter : Carbone published -- you heard a lot of it .
So let 's take a turn in a structure at the pattern of the coal ,
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noise , but this is the sound of the coal technology .
The coal consumption is between the main global warming , but the night of carbon , but the night technology of coal , which you see changes everything .
You look at a look . This is the coal technology 's clean technology .
Al Gore : At , the good good good good connects to the economic question and to the economic security and the national security .
Video : The America is in the crisis ; the national security , national security , climate crisis .
The flows that the lines all : our dependence on fossil combustic combustic and oil .
Now , there 's a new , audence , you know , solution for used to use it .
Repower America : 100 percent clean energy , in 10 years .
A piano to put America to work , make sure , make sure you more sure , and help stop global warming .
And so , it 's a solution that you 're going to solve our problems .
Repower America .
Al Gore : This is the last last .
Video : It 's about re-giving energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to get dependence on the dependence that killed our planet planet .
What 's the future is here . I mean , only a new energy , a new energy network .
What about the two : Noves investment for a good job retribbbuted .
Comption : Repower America . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old old African old African says , " If you want to go to the fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
The year at TED I did an introduction in LHC .
And I promise to figure back to how the car works .
So here I am . And for those that the other time there were no , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever -- 27 kilometers of circuit .
His task is to remember the conditions that were present less than a billion second in the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All this is just environment .
This is the car under Ginevra .
We spent these mini-Bang Bang in the relationship .
This is what I work .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions .
Ten September year we have accesus accesus , the first time .
And this photograph was taken by ATLAS .
It was immense of huge festegy in the control .
It 's a picture of the first phasy of particles that had done everything around the LHC , and window in collision , by a part of the LHC , and spread particles in the revenue .
In other words , when we see that image 10 , we figure out that the machine worked , which is a great viconic viconic .
I don 't know if this was this to do you exultent us , when someone went to Google and saw that the beginning was this .
That means we have a cultural impact beyond that scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the car , I had to these dored sleep here -- these dored dored .
These files leaving 13,000 amps when the car works at the machine works at the massive thing .
Now , the technicians between you will look at the kids and say , " That 's not true . I 'm too hard .
And they can do it because when they 're very cold becomes up , superconnects .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a windoor in the wider of space between the stars , these flows can bring that corrate .
In one of the squarters in the LHC magnets in LHC , there was a fabrication of fabor .
So the float scale , and the 13,000 feet of the presermined suddenly introduced a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnets more than 20 tons , and that you have been about 30 centimeters , and that 's been moving about 30 centimeters .
They 're damaged about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we did .
We 've been restined and it 's traveled .
Now they 're coming back all back to their place .
I mean , you know , the LHC is is going to be new integrum .
We 'll accening it , and we expect to get this data to judgly , and continuing so our adventure to discover what the morning for the morning for the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these incidents reaching the debate on the debate of science and engineering in frontier . It 's easy to confuture .
I think that 's so difficult , the fact of going to go beyond the limits , I think that 's value of things like the LHC .
I 'd like to conclude with the words of a Ingan scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , imagine , in defense of his puppils , he was Michael Faraday , he said , " Nithing is so dangerous to progress of human mind as a record to the ideas of science , which is not in nature , which is meant , in nature , and no nature , which is not nature , and in our tripes , and that are not completely rearburges , and that are not completed in the ideas that we don 't works .
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to rethink about when children , you play with the morning .
And as you realize how to reach them and deal with them , and you learn how to think and solve problems and figure out problems and keep in the space and manipulating relationship .
The space is depth connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , as we 're inspired by the use of our interaction with physical objects , with my connection Patts , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanianithi , I began to ask me , " And if we use a computer , instead of having only a computer polluting , which we can only deal with a desktop of the digital pital features ,
and we sistemarge our feed ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Sifttest is a big interactive computer like a cookie .
In a few words , a Sifttest is a big interactive computer like a cookie .
You can move them with your hand , they can see them , you know , you know their movement and have a screen and a screen and a radio .
But most of them , they 're physical objects , like the morrow , you can just move it just fairly .
The Siftable is a new ecosystem for manipulate the digital information .
And as it 's more physical , the other people 's just the time , the other , and as they become more physicistic , conscious , of the other people , how we move , we can explore new and fit 's fly physical and different interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siften is configurate to show the video : if you including it in a direction , the video rrich , if you 're going to the other side back .
These interactive riting ritrats are conscious .
If I run them , you 're interested in what 's around .
If they 're circuit , they notice it and they can act a little bit .
If they 're circuit , they notice it and they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power of the interaction was the power of data , to put a color like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurated as a secks and I can use them to put them in the central color in the central , where they mix .
and I can use them to put them in the central color in that central , where they mix .
We can actually put a bit too much place .
They also have a great possibility to learn , like languages , the mathematics and games where people can prove the fast , and see the results of the immediately , and see the results of it .
Now I 'm now --
This is a Fibonacci sequence that I do with a equations of equations .
Here we have a game of words that 's half in Scarabean and Boggle .
By , in every turn a letter to every turn on every Siftable , in every turn , Pratically , at every turn to be a letter on every Siftable , and while trying to understand him about the words of control him on a direction .
Then , about 30 seconds , you get a new set of letters and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came up to the Media Lab , I did so that they tried them and turned a video .
They were very much .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people a lot of educations .
You just say , " I mean , " That 's words , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's how other people who try it .
This is our own own younger header , there on the right .
It was actually just taking them .
They were just in the morning , for him .
Now , this is a cardboard application of a card .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning languages is Felix .
It can insert new characters in the scene , just just by the Siftacks , they 're going to be able to do .
It can insert new characters in the scene , just just by the Siftacks , they 're going to be able to do .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The only surprigend is .
David Merrill : Now he 's taken a track in the scene .
Video : The arange treator .
So , you know , you know , you know , it !
So I school Siftable and put up nearby putting the characters --
Video : Bau !
I 'm making your story .
Video : Hoo !
DM : It 's a story with the open . And it can decide him how it 's not going to be .
DM : It 's a story with the open . And it can decide him how it 's not going to be .
Video : For , gateful .
DM : The last example I have time to show you is a tool , recently , to willing and to willing music and execting music .
is a tool , recently , to willing and execting music .
The Siftable here are suons of sounds like the bass , bass and the bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also insert these sounds in a sequence to you can buy your feor .
And to move it just doing a sound and a sound and a sequence .
These are actually , you can control from the way , like reverbs and the filter .
I attacks it to a particular sound and then including it .
And then there are the general effects as time and fly , which you apply to the whole sequence .
We 're looking at how it works .
DM : We 're going to put a base in two Siftable , we 're going to put them into a series , we 're extend to a series , we add it , address it , we add other base .
I put a bottom line .
Video : DM : I add percussions --
Video : And now I 'm going to put the battery , so I can control the effect from the alive .
DM : DM : I can fly the whole sequence by one side or another .
Video : And now I 'm going to add the filter the bottom of the basement to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can recombine the sequence " to fly . "
So I don 't have to plan it first , but I can improvising it , longer or more short .
And now , finally , I can spent the whole sequence by inclining to the left Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new must interface new murders than how our brain and the body work .
And today , I had time to show you one of the result of this lost , and some possibility that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept I want to turn is that 's coming up with this new generation of projects for interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk with all of you .
They 're a writing .
I think about this is my profession , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also love and the love of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But I said this , something particular happened in my life and my career , who took me to recently realibrate the whole relationship with this job .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called " Manogy , " which , " which , diversity , " which , diversity , for some reason to my previous books , for some reason to become an international , and became a huge sensationship .
And the result is that everywhere go , now , people treat me as if I was convicted .
It 's true -- convicted , convicted ,
They 're going to me now , everybody worried and say , " Don 't you know , you don 't fear more than that ?
Don 't you fear to keep in all life without being able to create a book that can important someone ?
what can do you care about someone ?
It 's safety , you know .
But it could go to the worse , I remember that over 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a adolescent adolescent -- I was a writing .
I walked up the same reaction based on fear .
And people say , " Don 't throw me , " Don 't I success ?
Don 't you fear that humiliation of the rights killed you ?
Don 't you afrants to do this for all life without any of nothing is ever outside and dead on a couple of dreams with the infrants of fauling with the foot of fallisance ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yeah .
Yes , I fear about all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also fear of many other things that people can 't have .
As the high and other things .
But , how about this is I thought , and I was asking me lately , I was why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anybody would expect to be spent by a job that 's born to do .
But what 's there so particular in the creative impress to make us nervous about the health of the health of other people do not do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember a only time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he fear to be engineer ?
I never -- that block of the engineer John , how do it go ?
Don 't work like this , you know ?
Onests , chemicals like group don 't certainly , in the chemicals , the reputation of being alcoholily .
We have a writers , we have pretty reputation , and not just the creative of all this , we have this reputation of being enormously unstable mentally .
And it 's not remaining other deaths of the magnificent magnificent minds that , just in the 20th century , died young and often for them .
And even those who are not suicipate data they really look at being disfaced by their dons .
Norman Mailer , before I die in the last interview said , " Every my book killed me a little bit more " . " A extraordinary affermation about work .
But we don 't buy when we feel that we heard these things , because we 've heard these things that in some way we completely interior and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering is in some way , and the art , at the end , will will be able to be .
And the question I want to get all of everybody is , you know , you know , you know , with this idea ?
It 's good to be this thing -- because also watching it 's a centimeter of distance to me , not good for anything this suppose .
I think it 's hatched .
And I think it 's even dangerous , and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encouraging our great creative minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start fire at the end of the dark , most of the circumstances , especially dangerous circumstances in which I 'm in my career .
That 's really -- I mean , I 'm pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I 've got about 40 years old .
I still have about four decades decades in me .
And it 's very likely that whatever I wrong with it 's going to be judated from the world as the work that 's used after my last book .
I 'm slying , because we 're all about friends here -- it 's likely that my largest myes is my great success to my shoulder .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start gin the nine of the morning and nine , and I don 't want to do it .
I would like to keep doing this job that I love .
So , the question is , how do it ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflections , that the way to work to keep writing is to create a psychological costruction , OK ?
I have to find a security distance of security between me , which I 'm written , and my natural anxiety on which is going to be able to get . And , as I was trying to do this day , and I was looking through the time , trying to find other societies to see if they could have the best ideas and more healthy sane .
about how to help people make the inherent inherent inherent inherent people of creativity .
And that research taken me to the ancient Great Rome .
Seguitem me because it 's a circle and then back .
In the ancient Great Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
And it was thought that creativity was this spirit look divine and it was that they were men from a few source and unknown .
The grew called the Deadvocate these spirits of creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a demon that elargives wisdom from the far .
The Romanes were the same idea , but they call that spirit that kind of spirit without a genius .
which is great , because Romanids didn 't really think that a genius was a genius .
They think a genius was a genius of entities that had lived in literally in the walls of a job , a bit like the held Dobby , and that came out to see , and that came out of the job and to come out of the artist and putting the outcome of that job .
Except -- here 's the distance of which I talk about -- that 's the distance of psychological cougical that you protected from your work .
And everybody knew that was so that it worked , right ?
So the anticies were protected by certain things , like the narcissism too , right ?
If your work was excited about it , you couldn 't take all the goods , everybody knew that you were helped by this genius .
If your job job , it wasn 't all your killness , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a hycle .
And so the people han concept for a long time .
And then Renascivance came and everything changed , and nacque this great idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe , and no longer space to put in all of my misters and no longer space to put space in divinity .
This was the rational principle of human humanity and people began to think that creativity was completely by ishared ilizes .
And for the first time in history , I began to refer this or that artist as a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a kind of a genius .
And I have to say , I think that was a big mistake .
I think that allow someone , a simple person to believe that you can be as a recipient as the source , the essence and the source of all mysteries , creative , unknown and ethird is a very large responsibility to the humans .
It 's like to ask someone of the sun .
Deform and distores completely the ego and creates all these inextremes expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pressure to have this pressure to the artists in the past 500 years .
And if that 's true , and I think that 's the question is , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mystery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't square 500 years of rational in a 18 minutes .
And probably there 's people in the audience that would be legitimate suspected on the notion of the notion of , insometm , you do that they follow people by making their projects .
I 'm probably not to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to get is -- why isn 't it ?
Why don 't you think that way ?
Because it 's more sense than anything else I 've ever heard to explain the exasperformance of the process of creative process .
A process that , as everybody who ever tried to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- it doesn 't understand rationally .
And in fact , it can sometimes seem totally paranormal .
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poetesh Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years old , but that was a poetesse for all life and told me that during his childhood in the Virginia , and he fellow it , and he felt it , and he heard it , and he heard it , and he felt it , and he heard it , and he felt it , and he heard it ,
He said she was like a fragorous train of air .
And that was rotating toward her from the landscape .
He felt it was going to be , because she was so much a way to take the land under his feet .
He knew you had one thing to do at that point and it was , words , " corrings like a major . "
And so it 's toward home and he wouldn 't have to get other than taking a piece of paper and a match of paper and a match and a match of paper , while the training , and I would take it and saying it on the page .
Sometimes you couldn 't be fastonishing , so it 's and run and run without get to home and the poem his roundly through and she would keep it to go into the landscape , trying to , as he said , " one other poet . "
And then there were those times -- this piece I never forget it -- there were moments that was almost losing it , OK ?
So , he was running up to home and the poem was trying to paper and the poem was going to a match in the way , and then she said , what was going to go , and then he said , " What was like if you train with the other hand and the coffer .
And he was the poem from the tail and reputting it in his body and transplypage .
And in these cases , poetry would be presented on the perfect page and it 's about the last word at the first word at the first word .
So when I felt it -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly the same thing to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a mulo , and my way to work is , wake up , wake up to the same horaries every day and to work and go and go and go and go and to go and go and to a god .
But even I have , in my headdaggin , I bought against that thing , sometimes .
And I think that also many of you did the han did .
You know , even if the work and ideas came up with me from a certain source , I couldn 't honestly .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it in a way that we don 't do the headait , but , rather , how do you get you healthy ?
As I think about , the best example of a Tom Waits , I have been the Tom Waits , which I interviewed a different day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life is the incarnation of the artment of the artment of the articate , trying to control , gesting these species of impulses totally internested .
But then I invited , he got up , and one day as he was driving on a driving on a car in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going to go fast and everything of a sent training this little bit of melody , which comes into his head as inspiration , elecusive and train , and training it , and it wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and it 's not how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a match , it doesn 't have a register .
So , it starts to feel this kind of old anxiety growing in him like , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to lose it from this song .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go into the panic , they stop .
It was the whole process of mental process , and he did something completely new .
He just look at the sky and said , " Don 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" Do you look like a song now ?
If you really want to exist , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
Otherwise , I walked to take any other today .
I got to disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process of working changed after this .
I don 't work , it was still dark like it .
But the process , and the fish that was re-handle , the genius was re-handed when the genius , the genius that was going to go from , and walking it back where they came from , and made that wasn 't to be an internized and wasn 't been internal , and turned .
And they 're going to do this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration in Tom and this strange thing that it was not Tom .
So how much the story I was going to change a little bit the way I worked , and I was save me a time .
This idea , I was going to save me when I was writing " Manogy , " Ama , " and falls in one of those cave dispersation where we all work on something and we can 't start to do it and we can 't start to be a disaster , which is going to be the worst books .
Not just a bad , just the worst book .
And I began to think of gecting this project .
But then I remember Tom that was talking about the air and I tried us .
So I got up to my face on the handed and I realized my hard to a vacuum of the room .
And I said to high voices , " What do you go , you know if this not brilliant book is not going to be interacted my , right ?
Because as I 'm going to be putting everything I have , I don 't have any more than that .
So if you want it is better , you have to present your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my job .
And I want to flew that I 'm now now showed me to do my side , " because -- at the end is so , OK -- secoins ago , in the deserts of North people were saying for damages to the kid of the kid , and music that they were saying for hours and hours .
And they were always magnificent , because the ballerners were professional and they were wonderful .
But every so much , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists was actually transpending .
And I know that you know what I 'm talking about , because I know you all have seen a point , a performance like this .
It was like the time stopped , and the dancing dancing through a kind of a brought and not doing anything different from the usual , as 1,000 nights before , but everything was saying , but everything you 're trained .
And suddenly not appeared as a human .
But it turns out to be accurate in the fire of divinity .
And when this was happening , at the time , people knew what was , they call it with his name .
They knew their hands and began to be " Allah , Allah , God , God , " God , God . "
That 's God , you know .
Curious known historical -- when Ms invader the South South , took this habits and pronoundins with their own and the cooking for " Allah , Allah , " Allah , " Allah , " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " Ols " Fight-
In Spay , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , " Allah , magic , " Allah , magic , " I 'm going to rehensible , " I 'm going to go back .
And it 's great because we need it .
But the problem is coming up , the problem is going to dance itself , when you wake up and discover that 's the 11 morning of Martedutes and God , there 's no longer .
It 's just a mortal with bad gyptic to the knees , and maybe it will never height to that alteeth .
And maybe no one will be the name of God still as it goes , and what so you must do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most pain reciliations that we can do in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angotta be so angosh , if you can 't believe , inturn , the most extraordinary aspects of your being come from you .
But you just believe that they 're just going to be a prested by unimaginable source of this source of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think it 's this way everything changes .
And so I started thinking , and I was sure , and it 's such as I thought , as I thought I was in the work of the book that publishing soon , and dangerous , spent , spent , walking , and I was going to do it by my great success .
And what I have to keep up when I feel elected elected by this is , not putting .
Don 't just your work .
Continua presentation of your part , any way to be .
If your job is dancing , bad .
If the divine , absurging you decide to leave a few kind of wonderful wonderful , for just a moment through your effort , just a moment through your efforts , then " Olay ! "
Otherwise , you do the same thing .
" Ole ! " You know the same .
I think we have to teach it .
" You know , you know , even for you had to have a hundred hamor heads to the tip continually .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And I talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean , and the discovery new genes .
We 're starting a new path new : We began to digitalize biology and now start from that digitalizing , we 're entering a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We 've always been trying to get large questions .
" What is life ? " is something that many biologists I think they 've tried to understand and vary levels .
We tried different approaches , reduced to the third minimum .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was going to go from the analogical world of the computer biology in the digital world .
Now , we can regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest genome that can autorem in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to make one even smaller .
We can put together a hundred genes of about 500 genes of about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his metabolic map , it 's relative to our .
I think this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes we can eliminate , one at a time , is very improbable that this can bring a living cell a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to provide was synthesize this chromosome that we could have modify to get some of these fundamental questions .
So we started the adventure of " Can we synthesize a cromosome ? "
What can we have these great molecules that we never could make these great molecules that we never could create before ?
And , in case , we can we make a cromosome ?
A cromosome is simply a piece of chemical material .
The speed that we 're able to digitalize life is growing at exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , rather , procredit grew rather slowly , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results the results of exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process is require a lot of pass , starting with a bioetic review before we began the first experiments .
But we found that DNA synthesize is very difficult .
There 's tens of thousands of cars in DNA , the long-hand-50 longethreatens , and it 's a process : the longer segment is , the more the segment is , the more errors .
So we had to develop a new method to assembly these fragments and correct the errors .
And this is our first tattempt , to start by the digital information genome of Phi , 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills .
We designed the fragments , actually , the correction of errors and get a molecule of DNA molecule about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemical material , and we put it in bacteria , bacteria have began to read this genetic code and produced them to read this genetic and produce particles .
The viral particles have been required by cells , they came back and destroke the Electan .
I talked about recent with membrals of the oil industry saying that they 're certainly understood this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build the same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in larger .
We wanted to build the whole cromosome of bacteria .
They 're over 5800,000 genetic code .
So we thought we 'd build it in cassettes of the virus , so that we can change the seven cassquarters to understand what the components of a living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these are to be very accurate .
When we sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 accuratezes was a herror for every 10 miles .
We found , resequency , 30 error . If we used that original sequence , we never would be able to do it work .
One part of the process is designing 50 long-long-lecting segments that are almost 50 letters to build up in the smaller segments to work together .
We 'll give them the only one here .
You probably have a bed that we put on the fiddle of the physical fiddle .
Think of this : we have a genetic code based on four letters : A , C , G and Ts .
Three of those readers together code about 20 friendly 20 minoacids , and there 's a specific order to each minoacid .
So we can use genetic code to write words , frames , frames ,
What we did we have in the beginning is autograph to do .
Some of the fact that it wasn 't poetry .
We designed these segments to just joined to join .
There are enzymes that repair them and they put them assimed .
And we started assembly assembly , by five to segments from five to segments from a lectacks , to give them 24 miles reading segments of 24 miles letters .
We did this step we produced these segments in abundance so that we 're trying to make a very very robustood -- you 'll see a extremely robustood -- you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatizing the process .
So , this seems the tabellon a basket .
When we get to arrive these very long segments , more than 100 miles , they 're not going to grow more directly in the Electum .
You get to the limit of the modern tools of the molecular biology .
So we 've been considered to be other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination , which in biological biological , which is using biology to repair the DNA can unset the segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiation , it can absorbed three million rad of radiation .
You can see in the super requarters as his chromosome is destructed .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly how it was before .
There 's thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely .
They can live under a vacuum .
They 're absolutely certainly that life exist in space , and you moving to find new rich environments of water .
In fact , NASA showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processes , just using the least design of the segments of insert to insert .
The least assemble is automatically .
This image was not taken with a microscope electronic microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a great molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the publishing we did a little time ago .
They 're over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule than the defined structure that man 's ever made by man .
It 's got a weight molecular weight in 300 million .
If we stood with a card 10 without spaces , you would like 142 pages , it would just take 142 pages ,
Now , how do we do it work ? How can we activate it ?
Of course , you love a virus is a guys .
It 's a little bit more complicated when you use bacteria use .
It 's easier , even when it 's ekarote , you can just extract the nucleus and insert another , which is basically the cloning and insert another , which is basically the clonation .
In bacteria , the archaea is instead of integrated inside the cell , but we have recently recently , we have recently recently a tremely complex of a cell to another and activate it .
We can have a cromosome with a microbial species .
The two are different than men from the men .
We added some gene more way that we could decide what choose to choose for this chromosome .
And then the labs with the enzymes so that we kill all proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was stuit -- and appreciate our sophisticatogist -- new cromosome -- the new cromosome .
And we were we thought we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried anyway .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that a lot of species have added species have added a third or a third himself a second thousand new tracts to that species .
So who think about evolution as only gene gene to evolution as only gene has no understood a lot of biology .
There 's a restriction of restriction that advoctures to say , " DNA .
The cromosome that was in the cell .
The cell phone that we have inserit-mosome we inserit-fold .
And it 's expressed , and recognized the other chromosome as a summmed material , and we were returned with only the cell and the new chromosome .
it blue to become blue because of the genes we put .
And in a short leave all the characteristics of a species have gone , and it turned out of all the way , and it turned into a new species , based on the new software that we inserious in cells .
All proteins are changed , membranes are changed , and when we read the equivesal genetic code to what we 've been transfer .
Now , this could seem alchemy genetic , but we 're going to hate the software , so on , basically basically basically basically .
Now , I 've already explained that you don 't talk about genesis -- but for progress starting from three and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of Cambrian , in which will come to create new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty obvious when we think about our necessity .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people at nine in the next 40 .
Right for example : I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 ; there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and cleaning , medicinals and gas for six billion .
It 's going to be more tough to do it for nine billion .
We use a tremendous more than 30 billion carbon , over 30 billion oil bets .
That means percent million baries a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or whatever kind of process to reducing them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep all the hemiddle of CO2 from these materials that end in the atmosphere .
And today , thank you to scientific discovery all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the components for the future .
The electronics industry only only is a dozen about a dozen components , and think of how many different things came out .
Our limits here are basically by biological reality and our imagination .
We now have the techniques , thanks to these rapid metods of synthesization , that we call a combinatory genomics combinatory .
We can build a big robot that can produce a big robot that can produce a million cromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes or to try to optimize the process processes to produce eight-to-drugs , we can change , because of a little team , and to create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for a chance of survival , production , chemical or fuel , production of etc .
This is an instantanea of some software programmed to be able to seat and design species to the computer .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
We 're going to be concentrating on the fuel of the generation .
You also see you that extract ethanol from the grate was a finished finished experiment .
We have fuel fuel , and third generation that will be soon as soon as the eightest as the eightest or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a great impact without increase without increase more than food and limited the constrainability to transform CO2 in matter , so we 're working on to design cells that we 're working for working on celluence , and we think we can have this purpose that can be able to do this purpose , and we think we could have the first generation in about 18 months .
The solar light fit with the CO2 is a metodownstroke -- but in our discoveries all over the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2500 meters of depth of the water temperature .
They reputting out from CO2 using molecular hydrogen molecular energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can put CO2 , which can easily be transmitted by tubes , converting that CO2 in fuel , to drive this process .
So , we think we could be able to increase what we can be able to increase what the basic is Nice , versus , " and we have the compared mod-obic . We have the gotten mod-oil industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And also , we 're working on to use the same metods to create instantaneous vaccines .
You 've seen this year with influence , we 're always back a year , and with a dollar in less when it 's a dollar in less ,
I think that you can change building fighting in a lot of fighting .
This is how the future can start seem changing , now , the tree of evolution , by the way , to accelerating the evolution with bacteria synthetic bacteria .
We 're so on the best people .
Our purpose is to do a long way of long long to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'm going to see , the fastest possible , some fundamental work , new technology that we took the Microsoft in followed a year ago ago exactly . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment that you can interact is to local level that remote with a huge amount of data .
We 're seeing a lot of digital gabyte photos with a kind of a kind of photos and continuous queery , disponing the images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these are collection of data or the images .
Most of the majority are digital photographs , but this is a scan from Bioeca Congress , and reaching in the mom of 300 megapixel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that limited the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen in any time . It 's a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , example of data not not images .
This is the Dickens of Dickens . Each colonna represents a chapter .
And to show you that it 's about textbook , we can do something like this , to make something like this , to really show you really see that it 's a real representation of the textest , not a photo , not a photo .
It could be a little bit of a little artificial electronic book .
It 's not a advice .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of The Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of a magazine , or a quotidian , which is for nature , a lot of a quotidian , which is for nature molteam ,
We also did something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We 've created a higher advertising , higher than that you use in a normal publishing -- much higher published -- and we put you inserious content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see it here .
Or other models , or even the specific specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on the screen .
We hope that means you 'll end up the pop-up and other porcheries , and other porcheries , not to be necessary .
Of course , mapping is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if we don 't say we have contributes to this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , geospaces over a geospatial picture .
So now we go to something else .
This is now actually , in the Web , you can go to the Web .
This is a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research interesting computers , in fact , by Noah Snavority , student of Washington , with Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Steve Szeliski , the Microsoft Research .
And it 's from Seb , gestite from Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this guy screen , where we can go from a picture to the other and have this kind of experience .
But the space of the images here has actually a meaning meaning .
The algorithms of visualization computers have recorded these images together , so that corresponding to the real place in real place that the image -- all scared by the Laghi Montagream -- they were taken . So , you 're taken . So , you 're taken . So , you see elements of the elements of a slightly slide , and these are all the time time time .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to spend directly to one of the original Nohhhit -- and this is from a previous prototype of Photosynth that we did for the first time the summmer extremendous scortexture -- to show you what I think is the key behind this technology , the Photosymptoxic . And it 's not necessarily evident .
We had to worry about legal aspects and so on .
This is a reconstruction of Notre Dame images , from Flickr . Baast , types of Notre Dame in Flickr , and you get images in the magnitude , other fields and saying . On these conies of the other arancies , which is discovery that you 've discovery .
So they 're all pictures from Flickr , and they were all connected to this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this way simple .
You know , I 'd never thought I 'd ever think about the end to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying to receive this kind of accoholding here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of different kinds of phones that are in the phones .
And if I can go , I try to try to try to look like those strange .
Most of them are block , so that .
And some part here is a lot of photographs -- that 's a photographs -- that .
This is a Notre Notre Dame registered correctly .
We can go from the poster to the vision of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This now is taking data from the entire memory -- from the entire memory of how the land , from visual voice -- and you connect all those data together .
All those pictures become connected together , the higher than the som of the parts .
You have a model of the land that 's emerges .
Think about this as a such as Stephen Lawler 's work in the virtual Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as people do it , and the advantages for the huge .
Their pictures are married with the other people .
If someone is the idea of the idea of the things that you have all these saying the name , my photographs of Notre Dame suddenly , you know , and I can use it as a metheless of all the data , and I can use it as a methaphor , using photos of everybody , using the photos , and have a social experience of cross-moed cross-mothern cross-moking .
Of course , a consequence of this is virtual models , in fact , in fact , not only collective , collective , not just as an airplanes and images , and satellitarians , but from a memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software going to do is that a certain point in the next few years , all the photographs shared by everybody in the entire world will be basically lined together ?
BAA : Yes . What 's doing in practice is to discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the basis on the content of the images .
What 's really interesting if you think about the wealth of semantic information that 's semantic information that 's a lot of these images .
As when you do a research of images on the Web , you put a sentence and the textic page has a lot of information about the pictures of the pictures .
Now , what happens if that pictures you connected to all your pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of wealth that is really enormous . It 's really huge . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible .
BAA : So you thank you very much .
One of the main please , when you travel and one of the ethnographics is the power to live in the wind who has no forget the anti-traditions , between the past , the touch the past , touch it in the stone , the wind floor , you can drive the plants .
And the thinking that sciamani Jaguar travel even beyond the Lattea , or whether the old Inuit 's still college me , or that in Himalayas , the Himalayas , the budddies still the importance of the Dharma , to remember the importance of the Dharm , to remember the world that we live live in no sense , but it 's just a model ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our own own own own own own stands has done , well , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all sharing the essential tracts .
We all hired . We 're all procreating .
We 're subjects to return out .
We have to deal with the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprising and therefore --
We all have an art .
What hit is the particular rhythm of the song , the dance of every culture .
Not that they 're the Penan 's 's " Borneo , or the following of Haiti , or the following of Haiti , or the desert of the Kenya sectrils , or a cammouth , or a camp in the AAAAhara camp in Sahara .
He was my journey of journey in the desert a month ago , or a huge habit of the Qomolangangma , in Everest , the mother of the world .
All these populations teachers are taught us us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of model , other ways of moving in the world .
And if you think , you 'll be a second , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
Insise together , cultures of the world creating a ragnature of life and cultural and cultural that the planet and cultural well-being and cultural well-being as the planet as the ragnature as a ragal .
And you can think about this ragnature as a cultural ethnosmoke , and you can define ethnosmom , the total ethnosh , dreams , mites , intuitions , intuitions , ideas , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitions , intuitive ,
The ethnossphere is the patrimonium of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be as species as species .
And because the biosphere was very much consumed by ethnosal , and it 's much much faster and purpounds much .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species is or the horrise of just because it 's false it 's false -- or in the most optimistic extinction -- in the most optimistic diversity -- and not even close to hypothesize -- that of cultural diversity .
The index of this is , of course , the loss of language .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just a vocabulary or a series of rules or a series of rules .
A language is the shake of human spirit .
It 's the middle of every culture is coming in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a sound , a thought , a spiritual ecosystem .
And those 6,000 languages , as we 're sitting here in Monterey , at least half the horecchies are kids .
They 're not taught to kids , which means , like , less you know , not less willing to do .
What is the sad is more sad than the latest , the latest to be the last talk a language , not to have a language , not to have a way to transmit the promised or promised the promised the children ?
This orring is the state of someone in the world every two weeks : every two weeks -- every two weeks are the old muor and brings with the home tomber , the last syllabe of a ancient language .
And I know somebody who will say , " Isn 't it better ?
The world would not be a better place if we talk all the same language ? " Well , we talk all yoruba . We talk cantonese . It 's a cantonese .
Let 's talk kidney .
You will be a train of a tract thing that means not to talk about your language .
Today , I 'd like to do you a journey through ethnosat --
a little journey in ethnosfied to give you a little bit of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of existing really different ways of existing really different ways of existing .
Let 's take for example , Barasana , in Amazon , the sector 's popular , the popular of anaconda , which credies the myth of the walk of the swalking .
It 's a popular that 's not able to distinguish the blue because the time celests is identified in the forest time the forest , which depends the forest , which depends the popular .
They have a strange language and a regle regulations , detection exogamy , " you have to marriage a person who talk about different language .
Everything has radical in the past past , yet the particularity is that in these families that are talking about six or seven languages , because of the matrimons of myself , no one tlingues .
They 're just to hear and start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribe that I lived , the Waorani Waorani , the Waorani Ecuador a popular that 's first .
In 1957 , five missionaries have taken a contact a facing missionary .
They did not have been taking up in photographs that they had a few people who were able to address , forget that this populating populating that this populating populating that this popular population had never seen .
They collected the photographs , they turn the research of a form or a figure and , not finding anything , they have concluded that they were walked that was the displaces of the run , and they killed the five missionaries with the lance .
But Waorani don 't just killed the strangers .
They killed with them .
54 percent of mortality was caused by themselves .
We have hit at eight generations and we found two cases of natural death , and when we put up to know , they added that one of them was inved so that he died , and then they died it , and then they killed it . And they had a huge knowledge of forest .
The crazers were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognize it .
In the early ' 80s , I was assigned a very interesting tremely when my Harvard 's professor when I was asked to Haiti to willing to be intruly intruly in the Duvalier , and I impossessence to Duvalier , and I impossessing in the speed , and impossessare in to do the zombies .
To give a sense of miraculous miraculous , I should understand the Vodoun culture and that Vodoo is not magnia .
It 's pretty much than a complex metaphysical vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to say the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristiantheshian , Islam , Budddism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious feeling . And he did not religious . And he did not have any other than these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of tragic concepts that are slavery .
What makes the interesting relationship is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
The spirits can be invited by Great Acqua , they respond to the dance of dance and replace to replace the soul of the vive of the vive in a way that for a short across the god .
So , the voodooists say , " You know white white the gone to talk about God .
We say in the temple and forget God . "
And from the moment you 're possessing , is the spirit that you can do you ?
So you 're seeing these incredible events : following voodoo in the state of trance that touch tains impunsmooted a rather strong demonstration , rather strong than the power of the mind , when it 's catalyed in a state of extreme extreme extreme .
And in all the people with the most extraordinary people are the Kogi Sierra Nevada de Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta , Colombia sector sector .
To give us the ancivilization of the advantage of Colombic planets in the Colombic planning , the population was in the wind-stand-up , population was on the vulcanic , that you erge on the planning .
In a blood a blood , this popular popular , it 's never been conquered by the spagnology .
And so they 're governed by a clero , but their formation is quite extraordinary .
The young followers are taken away from the families to three or four , and they live secreged in a good world , and homes and the rooms of the ice , the glaciers for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years to produce the nine months of reducing the nine months of the gestation that spend in the usering of the mother , they 're now metaphorically in the Great Mother .
And so time , they get accultural the values of their society , values that predicting their predicts and just their predicts and just their prayers keep the cost , or to say , " balance .
At term this incredible begins , they 're suddenly taken out and for the first time in the age of 18 years , they see a high . And in that moment of consciousness , when the sun is wrong valley , when the kills beautiful beautiful valley , everything that learned in theory , it 's been confired everything that 's learned in the behind his splanding behind . The prete behind is , and he 's going to go back to the prete , and the pushand ,
" I 'm going to prior how I said .
It 's amazing . Now it 's to you protect it .
They call the major brothers and say that we , the minor handle , we are the colpitchen .
This level is extremely important .
When we think about the populations and the environment , we 're the Rousing and old story of the noble self-vage story , which is a razy concept in his simplicity or perhaps , we 're saying that these population are closer to the Earth of us .
The Ingenius are not feels , not feelings out of the nostalogy .
There 's no space for these things in the paluds of Astststopped , but because of the Tibet , but because of time and returns , and they created a mystics of the Earth , but on a very well of a neighborhood , but on a much more subtle . But the concept that the Earth can only live only consciousness .
What do you mean ?
It 's a boy of Ande that a boy of Ande that mountain is a bears of Apu that mountain is a beautiful human beings , it 's going to be a destiny different , and it 's going to be a very different relationship with the mountain or that place , and it would be a bunch of a male , and it 's going to be walk .
which is the dimora of a spirit or a mineral craft is irright-raised .
What 's interesting about this is the metaphor that define the relationship between individual and natural world .
I grew up in the forest of Columbia Britannica credding that forests served the forest .
And that made me a human being dimous human being from my Kwakiutl who believe that forests are the Hukuk , and the stort of the paradimora of paradise and the spirits of paradise and the dogs that live on the extreme , extreme , spirits that are during the Hamateful began .
If you start to consider that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of their sensitive discoveries . We take this plants .
I 've taken this picture to open in the Northin the Northin the Nordern Amazon .
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayahuge , the most powerful practical repertoilet 's the sciamanic repertoilet 's look .
What makes the test fascinating the ayahuge is not the physics of the substance , but his elements . It 's composed to two elements .
And from a hand , this leaving leaving a series of beautiful quarters , harmines and harm-molin , slightly hallucinogens .
Take the only plant , you have a blue smoke that alters a little bit the consciousness , but it 's mixed with the leaves of a coffee of the Psychotridis .
This plant contains switches , very similar to the serotonin , displtryltryltryltryltryltrypltryltryltryltrylens .
If you 're ever going to see Yanomami .
And so you 're going to be sparked by the nose is a bit like being disappeared by a bunch of pinches and pinches a sea of electricity . They don 't believe a distortion of reality ; creates dissolution of reality .
I had often I often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who took the psychedelic was psychedelic , with his discovery of fungi in Mexico .
I mean , I can 't be able to classify these tripamine as hallucinogens because if you can 't tell any one of trained being .
It 's possible to take it just if you 're just a little bit of other chemicals that money in MAO .
Now , the beautiful : A-carboline , which is the MAs , the same kind of MAO , the same kind of the same kind of potential , the same kind of potential , like the spontanem . The question spontaneous sources , how they do these popular popular deaths , but if you combine in this way , create a way , biochemical version is summmmma on the subjects ?
We use the great euliar hemistake , and the error , which can be infruttifer .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " The plants are talking about it . "
What do you mean ?
This tribe , the cofan , the Cofan , has 17 variety of the ayahumps , and that our eyes would go into the forest , and our eyes would go into the same species .
If we ask them as they 're going to stage their tasonomics say , " I thought I was the rest of plants , you don 't know everything ? " I said , " No .
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night of bunch and each night with a tone .
And that doesn 't fit to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that contact the stami .
Now , [ you know ] the problem is that even those of us who have heart the people who are puts in the ingenes are pitting in the world , but some reduced to the margins of history in the real world , and pass beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , in 300 years , it won 't remembering the ears or its innovations , but rather than how the era that we stopped and we used across and huge , activally , and we have been used to activity of biological diversity of biological diversity of the planet . Now , it 's not the change .
All cultures through the secoli have been involved in a dance for new chance of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux didn 't stop being Sioux when they put out of the American have been part and fit , like the American have no stopped to be American , when they put out of the horse and cales .
It 's not the change or technology that thnosfetnosh ,
The during the domination .
And if you look at the world , you 'll find that these are not cultures that these are not cultures .
They 're living people and dynamics and dynamics spints out of identifiable forces that go beyond their adaptop-up capable .
Which is the patria of the Penan Patria --
a populpular nomake Sarak , in the asian Asian , a popular who lived away from the forest to a generation , and now reduced to the service , and now reduced to the service on the red-lifetime , where you can see the clean of the lifetime that looks like the naves . Borneo , where naves naves naves , where naves navi naves naves ,
taking the sts with the wooos with the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease come with the gold .
If we move on the Tibet mountains of Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physical extinction of a popular popular , is conviction of a popular popular lifetnocise , is not only convicted , but it 's not just convicted , but it 's celebrate , because it 's part of strategy development .
And you can 't understand the Tybet , until you 're part of the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China , in the Western China through the Tibet South East , and by a young , but only came to Lhasa , but just came to Lhasa , I realized what we feel about .
6,000 sacred monuments in sacred and cencounters .
1.2 million people killed by the military military during the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical to Panchen Lama .
which means it 's been killed to kill Chinese 's agency .
His , it 's floor with Sua Santity , in the waspora that 's taken the popular in Nepal .
His mother was imprised and his color was rich .
It was taken to hide on caring on the age of two years , under his gonna because it wouldn 't live without him .
The sister , who did the same , was in the same reducing field .
One day has been walking a day raffering a day raffering a Mao raffering , was put up to the work for seven years ,
The Tybet can be insopportable , but the reputs of the popular popular is from popular .
At the end , all you reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the world monocromatical world or we want to accoiling the world of the policymatic policymatic ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before we die said that his greatest fear was that , in our going to go toward this amores of the world , we will see the entire gamm of human imagination to a limited mode of human imagination , but one day we will see , but one day we will swalking from a sonno way , even that there were other possibilities .
And it 's humiliating that our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Neolitics Revolution , who gave us the agriculture , who did us sucler to us the seed cult of the seed , by replacing the poetry of the mouth of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern industrialized world has 300 years .
The shelt square not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenge that we have to deal in the millennia that we have to go .
When these miric miric miric world is asked what you want to say to be human , they say with 100,000 voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all risky the possibility of being what we are : a kind of consciously , which has to make all the people and all the garden can truly . And there 's great moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the northern extremity of Baffin , when I went to hunting the whales of the Inuit , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , I told the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The government canador was not always gentle with the Inuit and in the 1950s to stabirhink our supply supply , we got them in colonies .
The grandfather than this man refuted to go .
The family , temitting for his life , took him away all his arms , and all his attices .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't themselves the cold , the exploit .
The ballows of sleeps in origin were made of charges .
The grandfather than this man didn 't intimise from the artical night or the library ,
It 's gained away , it 's hot the pantalone , and defected in your hand defected in your hand . When the phectual bs , I did her a lama .
He 's sprawn up on the door of this cut , and when I became solid , it 's killed a dog .
He wider takes the dog , and he created a brillic , with the house cass made a sleep , and it 's disappeared to a block , and it 's disappeared on the bankers .
We want to talk about cavarsely with anything ? [ you ] And this , in different ways , [ Apausi ] is the symbologist ] is the symbologist 's resilience of the Inuit and all the people of the world .
In the Adress 1999 government canading government redded by the total control of a larger area of territoral California and Texas .
It 's their new patria new patria .
It 's a Independent territory . They 're all the mineraries .
One splendid example of how a nation-state can remember with his popular popular .
And , finally , I think it 's pretty obvious at least at least to those of us was in these remote zones of the planet , remote that aren 't at the real real real business .
For someone is home .
They represent sections of human imagination that are coming up at the high of these children , like dreams of these children , like dreams of our kids , become part of the hope .
To final , we have National Geographic we convinced that politicians will never get nothing .
We believe that polemiics --
Apauses are not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the stories of the world . Each month , our website .
156 countries transmit our television canal television .
Our rescue is millions of people .
Our work is travel to bring our audience in places of wonderful cultural wonderful , cultural world 's out of cultural anthrow as they saw and , hopefully , burniture will be able to be in the central revealed , the world 's world to exist in the diversity , and multicultural world .
where the wisdom of all the people can contributing to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope that you 've already heard and I evidence some links , in case notakes some connections , in case not .
I want to start with what I call " the " official dogma . "
The dogma official dogma of what ?
The dogma official dogma of all industrial societies , the dogma official recite : " If we want to male the benefits of our citizens " The way to do is massive , " The way to do it is massimilar . "
The reason is , from a side , in fact that freedom is in itself a value , it 's precious , useful , essential for humans .
The other is that if we 're free , everybody can act to do everything that we massive , to do everything that massive our benefit , no one that decided in name .
The way to massimilar to the freedom is the choice .
The more choices people have , the more than they are free , and the more than their benefit is their well-being .
This , I think , is so depth sitting in society that no one would dream to put it in doubt .
And it 's also depth radical in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress I can .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly great .
I permit 's a simple note about condments .
In my supermarket , there are 175 condments , without content 10 variety of oil , and 12 holive , and 12 huge balsamic , which you can buy for you a huge number of condition in the circircircuit that no one of the 175 owners are already to be your degree .
Here 's what supermarket .
And then you go to the electronic store to buy a stereo stereo : CD , lector , radio , the CD , radio , the rais-up , amplificator .
And in this single electronic store , there 's a great number of components .
We can make six million and a half million different combinations using the components that there are only one store .
You have to admit that there 's a lot of choice .
Other the camps : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the phone services the phone services that were provided by mama Bell .
And he was the phone , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , between the other , was that the telephone never break .
These time time went .
We have a variety of telephones , especially in the phones .
Here 's the future .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 tapels , the nose of the nose , and the holds of the burn .
If you don 't see it in the store under the store in the home , you 're going to be able to be .
And what happens is that people enter in the stops and doing this question . And you know , what the answer is " ? " The answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do any way too much .
So , in other other than the life that are much more important than the acquired of the phidden explosion .
Audgan anitarian : It doesn 't happen in the United States , you 're going to go from doctor and the doctor , you have to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " OK , we could do A , or you can do . As these benefits and these " B benefits and these " B benefits . What do you do ? "
You say , " Dottours , what I should do ? "
And the doctor says , " He 's got these benefits and these benefits and these benefits and these benefits and these risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you can see you , " Dottore if she was me , what would do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not she . "
The result of the result of the malate result , expression that it looks like a good thing .
But actually , it 's not that a moment to move the fish and responsibility to make decisions from someone know , the doctor , to somebody else -- and almost certainly is sick -- and it 's almost certainly sick .
There 's a huge marketing products , direct people like me and you , that if you think about it doesn 't have any sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do you get them ?
The answer is that they want doctor to ask them to ask them to ask them to ask them to change .
Something that 's fundamental as our identity is a question of choice , how you see in this vignize . " We don 't want to give children to be able to . They don 't want to give the children .
And we can reinventing how many times you get .
which means that every morning , at the morning , you have to decide that kind of person wants to be .
I 'm going to be a marriage of marriage , a time , a common time , in nearly for anyone , was that he was that they moved the most soon as possible , and he was that you can .
The only real choice was with who , not when you 're , and not when you 're doing .
And it 's really to play .
I teach students very smart students , and I do 20 percent in less work .
And not because they 're less brilligent , not because they 're not saying .
but why are they impensierites , I mean , I should I wish saying , " I would I do this now ? "
" I should be later ? I have to think about before or the career ? "
They 're logorant interrogorange interrogorange .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this impldn 't completing the tasks that axed and you don 't get a good vote to my own .
And they really have to do it . They really are important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl underlucky , because it allows us to work every day , every day , from every corner of the planet , and whatever , from Hotel Randolph .
And I 'm talking about , there 's a correct , and I 'm not going to tell you , where the WiFi works .
I don 't say , because I want to use it .
What does this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work ? It 's that we have to keep , continually , at all the time , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son , playing the calcium in a cell , Blackberry in the other , and the notetebook , and the notetebook , and narrator , typically , on the gingercy .
And even though everybody 's spent , every minute that we see our child , we 're also asking the game , we 're also asking this , " I have answer to this call ? "
" I have to say this letter ? I have this letter ? I have this letter ?
And even when the answer is " no , this makes the experience of your child 's game very different than what would be in other conditions .
So , as we look at the time , small things , large things , and the things of life is a question of choices , life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : " That 's a few possibilities , but not everything was a question of choice .
The world of today is it looks like this : Idilemma is , " Is it a good thing , or negative ?
The answer is Shand , " The answer is , " Actually , " I think it 's Sholding .
The positive lesss them , so I 'm going to talk about the negative those negative .
All this choice is two negative effects of the people .
The first , paradoxally , is that produces paralysis that it 's paralysis that liberation .
With so many options in which choose choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I 'm offer a meaning example : a conduct that 's a conduct on volunteer .
A colleague has access to the Vanch data , the gigantic society of pension , with about a million clients implying in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in the more , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 source , there 's 10 percent adesions in less than when they 're available only five ?
Because with 50 funds in which choose , is sick , it 's a hard decided , and the choice is remained .
And I 'm asking questions , and I 'm asking , questions , and of course , and of course , and of course , and ask the questions never coming .
You know that doesn 't just mean that these workers are going to be eating food for dogs because they 're not going to have enough money , means that the decision is so hostics that they 're also losing the funds of complementary .
They 're not going to go , they 're losing to five dollars a year from the dator of work , which would be well disposed to be true .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too much choices .
And I think it makes the world .
" And finally , " ethernity : ketchup , " ketchup , "
You want to take the right decision , if it 's for ethernity , if it 's eternity ?
You don 't want to choose the bottom , and or or or the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoid the paralysis , and we 're not going to be satisfacts from the result of how we would be with less options in which we would choose .
And this for several reasons .
One of these is that with many condments between the holding , if you buy one and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that you could do a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined us industry , and the reduced the expensive imagined us . And the diminished the decision ,
And even when it was a good decision .
The more choices , the easier is easy to be toption of any detail that 's insection of the choice .
And also , there 's what economists call constitutes .
Dan Gilbert really well , stamazed that we 're going to do things about what we 're confrontiers to do with .
And in the rest , when there are many options , it 's easy to represent the characternative characternative , and be less satisfacts and be less sitting in the option that 's choice .
Here 's an example . I school with all of them who are not New York .
But that 's what you probably think about it .
There 's this couple to the Hamptons .
A place of lurther .
It 's splendida . It 's all about them . It 's all for them .
Nothing . But what he thinks is , " Well , drill , drive , is Auugust . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan is away . "
" I could talk to just in front of home . "
And it 's pass two weeks , from the idea that 's losing -- the possibility of parking -- the possibility of parking .
The constood is decrease the satisfaction for what we have , even when the choice was old .
And the more than we have to consider , the more the characteristics that are going to be back to us as constantly as constitutes .
Here 's another example .
This vignize us a lot of things .
It talks about living the moment , and maybe living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choose , you know , you choose to do other .
The things that we don 't choose have a lot of attractive attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : it 's growing the expectations .
I tried it on my skin beating a new jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
And once the jeans were just like , buy them and bought them from a bestivestivestivestivestion , were just later , and they were going to go .
So , I went to buy a new when the old old were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The commit said , " He wants to me slim fit , he 's relaxed relaxed ?
He wants to the certainly or the bottons ? " Stonewashed " or " ached " ? "
" Do you want to be strapped ? "
" You get them to the long-takes them a holds , " Blah blaw . "
I was saying , and after a while I was able to say , " I want the kind of -- that was the only kind of " -- which was the only like " I want to do that , so for a hour jeans , I walked out out of the jeans , I had the best jeans , jeans that I ever had .
It was the massive . And all that choice I had got the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse with all that choice my waiting was high , jeans had to be perfected .
I was going to be in the beginning . I didn 't expect anything excited when it 's only a kind of a kind of , but when I saw 100 different , stedless one guy had to be perfect .
What I was brought up , but not perfect .
After I had compared that choice with what I was trying to do with what I was willing to waiting .
The addition of options in the life of people don 't do that increasing expectations that these have respond to the options of the same options .
And this will produce less satisfy , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the marketing world if you realize it .
Because if I knew it , you would not know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more like this .
" He was better when it was worse , " The reason it was even even even when he was worse , it was that when he was worse , it was even even possible to meet .
And the world that we live in the world that we live -- opulents , industrialized citizens with the expectancy of the perpection -- massive that we can hope is that things are at the height .
You never surprised out because your expectations , the middle waiting , the middle of the wild .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse expectations " " Yes , you want . "
I mean , small autobiographic mofe -- which I 'm really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't have to do better , I didn 't have accounted .
But it 's not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of jeans , when there 's only that when you 're just the kind of jeans is that when you 're not satisfacts , and ask you say , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " The answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do you do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a lot of you insea insea , and ask you who 's the responsible , it 's as a clear that responsible , is as a clear that responsible , you 're .
You 'd do better .
With hundreds of available variety , there are no successful .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is , they feel the result is , they 're sentence and give the holes to them .
In the last few years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a meaning factor -- not the only , but important -- this is the only important -- of this depression of depression is that people in the depression of because standards are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that color is them .
So the final result is that we 're better , general , we 're better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than haven 't at all , but it doesn 't have a lot better choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've been super-handed by a piece of the level where the choices are improve .
Now , from the political point of view -- I almost finished -- from political view , the noccicilil is the following .
What allows all this choice in industrial societies is the wealth .
There are many places in the world , and you know it was a lot of places in the world is not that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too much .
So the face that I 'm talking about is a kind of modern modern modern , re-rich societies .
And what makes you have to be this : Steve Levitt talked about how much those expensive and the coos are inuuseful . It 's a spring of whatever the stopping .
I mean that these choices , complicated and dispendious , it 's not just inuseful .
They 're also to say of the eterious .
They 're worse to be worse .
If a little bit of what in our societies allows that were reversed in those where people have too much as a few possibility , not just would be a better , not just the improve , but also , our our .
This is what economists call a paretian improvement .
A redistribution of the reduction is good at all -- not just the poor -- because of this choice in excess that 's going back us .
For conclude , " Let , you can become everything you want to become everything you want ,
You know , you 're about culture , you 'll think , " What do that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get it into a glass of glass . "
" A castrated imagination , a limited vision of the world --
and I interpreted it so , at the beginning .
But then , I realized , instead , I realized that that fish the long-gone .
Because the fact of the fact is that if you mandate the boat , so that , " all you can 't get the freedom .
If you break the boat so that everything can diminuitous satisfaction .
Accer the paralysis , and you 'll reduced the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too , maybe even for fish , even even for fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some symbolic sphere is a recipe for infection and , for rovement .
Thank you very much .
