The year I showed these slides to show that the glacial calculation , which for almost three million years had the size of the U.S. continental 10-size arction , you 're reputs of the 48 percent .
But this subjects the gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice .
The glacial calculate is , in a certain sense , the world heart of the global climate system .
It 's expanding winter and you reverse .
The next slide is going to be a faster carlated on the last 25 years .
The ice perennia are signed in red red .
You see , you can see , you 're expanded up until .
That 's the ice in inverinter , which you reverse .
You can see that the ice ice ice ice ice ice lost , of five years or more , it 's like blood , which is like blood , which here smoke from the body .
In 25 years , it 's spent by so ,
This is a problem because the scale of the ground the ice ice ice ice ice , the ice of the ocean where there are enormous amount of coal congeled that , sleep , they 're turning out to transformed in the microbes .
I repected to the totality of the global atmospherection , that amount of global warming , that amount of the world 's around .
In some deep laghi in Alaska , the metano is already already is already rebing on the water .
The professorous professorous Katey Walter of Alaska was reached with a team clearly lake the winter .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : That 's good . The question is if we 're going to be .
A reason is that this termal exchange that 's surrounded Greenland from the northermal .
This is a glacial fiume .
House had never reached levels .
This is the Kangerlussuaq in the West Souast Greenland .
If you want to know how the sea level of the sea level of the ice of the ice , here is where you get to the sea .
These corrings are increasing rapidly .
On the other part of the planet : Antarctarticks of the planet .
The month of the scientists have clear , which the globe in the negative , and that Antarcticde Western , who 's pogestern in some islands , which is particularly fastly in the skip .
It 's six meters of the level of the active level , like Greenland .
On Himalayas , the third biggest blockers , you see new laghi , who are a few years ago were glaciers .
40 percent of the world population was going to be the water from the wind water from the wind .
Sulle Ande : this glaciers is the source of the source of this city .
The down-ground .
But when it comes up , the same way , the same happens to the water .
In California the snow on the Sierra Nevada is diminuit 's diminuit .
The hyouns are in cribe in crisis .
The predictions , like you read , they 're fleaves .
The growth security in the world leads to a remarkable increase .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm out of the normal and without precedental .
Four times more number of the world in the last 30 years respect to precedented 75 .
This is a huge of all insustainable .
If you look at it in the storytellical context if you can see the consequences .
In the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 24 hours of tons in the ocean every day .
Look attentily the Pacific area of the East Pacific , from the American East , towards the west of the subcontinent , where there is a radical iment of the ocean in the ocean .
Most of the global warming , together to the deforestation , which is 20 percent , is the use of fossils .
The oil is a problem , and the coal is even worse .
The United States are one of the two countries with China .
And you know , you know , a lot of other coal middle .
But we 're seeing a change of direction .
These are annoullated projects in the last few years and some projects of alternative projects .
And in the way , there 's a politics in our country .
The coal industries and oil industry have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promote the coal clean , which is a bone .
And I remember something I would remember to something --
I 'm going to be Natal , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a loss of 3.8 billion liters .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the biggest flow of scories in America .
It 's happened around Natal .
The nature advertising of one of the coal industries was this .
Video : Brosty the carbon is a purpose and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's going to grow our economy .
Frosty the carbon is more and more more published .
It 's a price , adorable , and the workers and workers are keeps .
Al Gore : From comes falling part of the West Virginia .
The biggest mineral society is Massey Coal . This is his amministrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid -- not know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima Proteition has launched two campaign .
This is a part of it , a part .
Video : Atter : Actor : Afore COlay we see the climate change as a threat to our business .
So , for that our priority is investing a large amount of money in a force public public and confused the truth of carbon .
In fact , coal is not sporary .
We think it 's a good profuse -- it 's also a good profum .
So , not preocupateves of climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : House : Holer : However .
So , let 's make a turn in a structure at the pattern for the coal published .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noise , but this is the sound of the coal technology of clean technology .
The carbon consumption is between the main the global warming , but the night is the technology of the carbon technology of clean technology that you see changes everything .
You have a look at a look . This is the hodial technology .
Al Gore : Infinally , the alternative positive connects to the economic security and to that national security .
Video : Seep America is in the crisis , the national security , national security ,
The file that the bottom of all : our own own fossil fuel , like the fuel and oil and oil crowd and oil crowd .
Now , there 's a new new , car solution for using it .
Repower : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work in the work , make sure , and make sure you , and help to stop global warming .
And , of course , a solution that you can solve our problems .
Repower America . Scover more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's about re-energy to re-fun energy to America .
One of the fastest ways to bring the dependence on the world 's dependence that killing our planet .
What 's the future is here . Sun , only , a new energy , a new energy network .
What you can do is two : Noves investment for a bunch of work .
Complaying : Repower America . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A old proverbio African says , " If you want to go fast , you go out from soles .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
The year at TED , I did a fectrum in the LHC .
And I promise to add the way to advantage to how the machine works .
So , there I am . And for the other time , there was no , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever taken -- 27 kilometers of circumference .
His task is to remember the conditions that were less than a billion a second of the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All of that is just environment .
This is the car under Ginever .
We do photographs , these mini-Big mini-Big mini-Big mini-Big mini-Big mini-Big mini-Big mini-Big mini-Big mini-Big mini-Big mini-Big mini-Big mini-Big mini-Big mini-Bang mini-Big mini-Big mini-Bang Bang Big Bang Big Bang Big , in the rely .
This is what I work . His called ATLAS -- it 's 44 meters and has a diameter of 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS , you can see the proportions .
Ten September 10 tember year we have acceso the machine for the first time .
And this photograph was taken by ATS .
It was immense to immense festegation in the room .
It 's a picture of the first of the particles that had made all the turning of the LHC , both , both in collision , with a part of the LHC , and spreading particles in the relator .
In other words , when we see that picture that picture 10 September , we understand that machine worked , which is a big vicictory .
I don 't know if this was this to do you exultent more or I 'm going to go on Google and saw that the page was this .
That means that we had a cultural impact beyond that scientific .
It 's a week after , there was a problem with the car , I had to these dorribs here -- these dorribs .
These files leaving 13,000 leaving when the machine works in power .
Now , the technicians between you look at the files and say , " It 's not true . They 're too much flower . "
And they can do it because when they are very cold sidans become the cosidjects are superconditions .
So , at less 271 degrees , at a temperature in the space between the stars , these files can bring that corrups can bring that corrups .
In one of the glongest nveilicle in the LHC , there was a furners .
So the files are surrounded up slightly , and 13,000 leaves were met of electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think these magnets more than 20 tons , and that you have been moved about 30 cents , and that you were moved about 30 cents .
They are damamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamamount of 50 magnetets .
We need to take them , what we 've done .
We restined them and adverted .
Now they are returning all of their place .
It 's the end of marzes the LHC will be again .
We 're going to accensive , and we expect to get this data to juy or liant , and continue so our adventure to find what the morning is the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these incidents reaching the dibate on the value of science and engineering in frontier . It 's easy to confuture .
I think that 's so difficult , the fact that it 's so difficult to go beyond the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a scientist Inglaughter , Humprey Davy , which , I imagine in defense of the inuseful experiments of his puple , Michael Faraday , said , " Nichael Faraday , said , " No is a lot of the way for the human return that the ideas of science are defines , which we don 't have to be completely , that our monkey , and that 's not about the new monsters are new monkey to be a totally . "
Thank you .
I want to start asking you to think about when you 're , you 're going to play with children , playing .
And as you understand how to reach them and you can get them and move them , and move them , and move them , and you learn in fact , and they 're actually going to think and sent relationships .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand the world around us .
So , as a information information process of our own physical objects , with my physical objects , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to ask me , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only cursor of the mouse as a digital policy , which we can have a little bit of the mouse that you move on a descend-fidly information with the way ,
and sistemle to our pleasure ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building , building the answer , building the Siftable .
In a words , a Siftable , a computer interactive computer interactive as a cookied .
In a words , a Siftable , a computer interactive computer interactive as a cookied .
You can move with your hand , they can see , " between them , they can see " between them , and they have a screen and a screen .
But most photos , they 're physical objects , you can just move them .
Siftable is a new ecosystem of a new ecosystem for manipulate information .
And as they become more physical , conscious , the other , of the other , and as they become more physical , conscious , of the other , of how we move , we can explore new and different lives of interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siftable is configurated to show video : if you including it in a direction , the video run it so , if you including on the other side .
These interactive ritrats are conscious to other people .
If I face them , they 're interested in what they 're going to them around .
If they 're circumit , they notice it and they can act a little bit .
If they 're circumit , they notice it and they can act a little bit .
They have a lot of their movement and inclination .
We realized that a interesting of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power of data , the data , to give " a color like a color like a color like a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable , we have three Sift-vernice and I can use them to put them in the middle , where they missed .
and I can use them to put them in the middle , where they mix .
If we 're too too , we can put a little bit to place .
It 's also beautiful possibility to learning , like languages , the mathematics and logical logical things where people can try and see the results of the immediately results , and see the results of it .
Now , I 'm going to --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a equations of equations .
We have a words of words that is half between Scarabean and Boggle .
Pratically , at all of the turn a letter to any Sift-case on every Sift-handle , at any Siftable , and while you try to buy people who are control on a diputs .
Then , after about 30 seconds you remiss , and you have a new set of reading and new possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here 's what children came in the Media Lab , I made them so I tried them and I was a video video .
They were very well floor .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people a lot of education .
You 've got to say , " What they know about words , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's how other people who are try it .
This is our younger header , there on the right there .
It really wanted to impilate them .
They were only one morning , for him .
Now , this is a charddge application of a cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of the languages . It 's Felix .
It can insert new characters in the scene , sold the Siften , they can be able to be .
It can insert new characters in the scene , sold the Siften , they can be able to be .
So , it 's doing it out .
Video : Sun is surprising .
David Merrill : Now he brought a treator in the scene .
Video : The arange treator .
Bel ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah ! Yeah .
So I was in Siftable and put them close to bring the characters --
Video : Bau !
and in their own story .
Video : Heo !
DM : It 's a story with final , and it can decide him how you spend .
DM : It 's a story with final , and it can decide him how you spend .
Video : Voly , gat all .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool , realized , to figure , to fix and exequal musical .
It 's a tool , recently , for the way to fix and exececk music .
The Siftable here are act with sound like base , based and bacteria .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also insert these sound sound to be buying these sound to be buying .
And it just furly to make a " sound and a " sequence " and a sequence . "
These are actually that you can control from the vive , like reverbs and the filter .
It 's a particular sound , and then including it .
And then there are the general effects like time and fly , and fly , that you 're apply to the whole sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : DM : We 'll start to put a base in two Siftable , " we 're going to get it in a series , we add it , we add more base .
Now I put a lower line .
Video : Now , I add some percussions .
Video : And now I 'm going to put the philtro , so I can control the effect from the vive .
Video : DM : I can fast the whole sequence inclinding the whole sequence of a time ,
Video : And I 'm going to add the filter to the lower phs to give more expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence " to fly . "
So I don 't have to plan it first , but I can improvisate , make it longer or more corta .
And now , finally , I can spent the whole sequence inclinding the whole sequence inclinding the Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is build new machine , new muts more and more more more more than our brain work and body .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this lost , and also some chance that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to spend is that 's coming this new generation of designed projects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk with all of you .
I 'm a writing written .
I think it 's my profession , but it 's more than that , but it 's more than that ,
It 's also the love and the fascine of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , I said this , something particular happened in my life and in my career , who took me to get the whole life and in my career , and I realibrate the whole whole thing .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called " Mangathered , Prega , " which , diversity , for some reason , for some reason books , for some reason it , and it became a big sensational , bbbecame , bbbecame .
And the result is that everywhere go , people go treating me as if I were condamannated .
It 's about -- condannated , condamn .
They are they going to be worried and say , " You don 't have a fear of the better ?
You don 't have a fear to continue to write for all life without power to be able to create a book that can 't do someone ? "
What can you do ? "
It 's rassure , you know .
But it might go worse , in the most of the 20 years ago , when I was going to say to people -- I was a adolescent adolescent -- I was a writing written .
I went to meeting the same reaction of the same reaction .
And people said , " Don 't you can 't have succeeded ?
Don 't you fear that the umiliation of the refurniture ?
Don 't you fear this for all life without nothing that nothing is coming out and you ever get out of the such of a such of a such of a dunder the bouth of failing with the bououth of failing ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I 'm afraid of all those things .
I 've always had afraid .
And I also have a lot of other things that people could not have to have .
As the alggae and other things .
But , as I think I was writing the thing I thought and I would ask me , and I was why is ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone 's expected to be spent by a work that you can do .
But what is there is so particular in the impress creative to make us nervous about health care about the health of the other people do not do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemistry and I don 't remember a only time in his 40 years of activity where the was asked if it was asked to be engineer ?
Are there was never -- that block of the engineer John , how do you go ?
Don 't work that , do you ?
Onestically , chemistrings like group , they don 't certainly have certainly , in the chemidddly , the reputation of being maniaced .
We have this reputation , we have enough this reputation , and not just writers , but creative to all of all that , we have this reputation of being enormously instable to be enormously unstable .
And I don 't think about the sad of the sad of the magnificent magnificent 's dead , just in the venturs of the 21st century , they died young and often for them .
And the ones that are not suicipate data seem to be really dissfidons from their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he die , in the last interview said , " I 've killed a little more " " " amazing " a further of the work of their life .
But we don 't buy the bleep when we feel that we heard these things that in some way we 've been completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are some way and suffering are some way and suffering is going to be a few way and suffering .
And the question I want to bring all here today is : You 're right now : You know , you know , you know , you know , what 's you 're about this idea ?
It 's good good that -- because it 's also looking at a hundred midd-inner , it doesn 't really do any supposed to all this supposed .
I think it 's odiosa .
And I think it 's even dangerous and I don 't want to see perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encourage our big creative minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start fire out in the middle that I felt with my own career .
And that 's really -- involved , they 're pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I 've been about 40 years .
I have still about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that any thing I writing to be right now , it 's going to be judged by the world as I work that I was going to my own book .
I 'm going to be square , because we 're all the or less friends here -- it 's likely that my largest success is .
Oh , Gesus , who thought .
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start to start to get a person in the morning , and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep going to continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question is , how do it becomes ?
And so it seems , after many reflections , that the way to work to continue to write is to write , and that 's what is to create a psychological costruction , OK ?
I have to find a few way to find a security between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural anxiety on which I can get other way . And , as I was trying to find other way , and I was trying to find other societies to see if they could have other societies to see if they could have have the best ideas and healthier .
about how to help people creative people to manage the emotions of creativity .
And that research has taken me to the ancient Great Rome .
I 'm going to be because it gets back in circle and then back .
In the ancient Great and ancient -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity was going to be that creativity was from men , OK ?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit seval , and they were saying , and they were sitting with a few sources and unknown , for reasons and unknown .
The greef called these spirits are called these creativity . "
Socrate , wonderful , he created to have a demon that elargives wisdom from far away .
The Romands were the same idea , but they call that sort of spirit , but they call that a genius .
which is great , because the Romanime , they didn 't really think that a genius was not really intelligent .
They think a genius was this sort of exciting lovely that you crew literally lived in the walls of a artest artest , a little bit like the Dobby , and that came out to see the work of the artment and modeling the outcome of that work .
It 's easy , that 's the distance of which I talk about -- that costruction psychological that I protected you from the results of your work .
And everybody knew that was that it was so that it was , right ?
So the anti-ceks were protected by certain things , like the too narcism , right ?
If your work was except , it was except , you could not take all of the gooddness , everybody had been helped by this genius .
If your failed work , it wasn 't all your own , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a hunting .
And so the people han concept creativity in the West for a long time .
And then Rinasciance came and everything changed , and blacished this big idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe and misters and without leaving space to the misters and no longer left space to write with divites .
This was the major of human rational and people began to think that creativity was completely from the ishared .
And for the first time in history , you start to referred to this or that articking as a very rather than a genius that a person with the genius .
And I have to tell , I think it was a big mistake .
I think that allow someone , a simple person to believe that a very simple person , like the source , the source of all the divins of all the divins , creative , inosconcible , inosconcible , and a responsibility to the humans .
It 's like to ask someone to inguiate the sun .
It 's a form and distores completely the ego and creating all these initive expectations on performance .
And I think it was this pressure to address the artists in the past 500 years .
And , if this is true , and I think it 's , the question is , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mistery .
Or maybe no .
Maybe we can 't cell 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people between the audience that would sollevers to be able to be asked to be able , insometimes that follow people follow out of their own projects .
I 'm probably not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I would like to take is -- why isn 't it ?
Why not think that way ?
Because it 's more sense of all that I ever heard to explain the exasperformance of the process of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever ever loved to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- it doesn 't buy .
And , in fact , it can sometimes it seems to completely paranormal .
I did this meeting with the amazing poetesse Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but that was a poetesse for all of life and told me that during his childhood , and he was working out in the Virginia , and he was hearing out in the fields , and I felt , in the poem .
He said he was like a fragorous playful spring .
And that was rotolating towards her landscape .
It was going to be , because it was so much of the earth under his eet .
He knew you have a solar thing to do at that point and it was , " run like a matter . "
And so it 's towards and he was going to come up with this poetry , and it wouldn 't have to make a piece of paper and a fairly , while the trapare , and I would share it and safely to rare it .
Sometimes I couldn 't be fast , so that he would run and run and run out and he was going to come in home and the rotles was going through and she would keep it through the landscape , and he would continue to rotles through the landscape , how he said , " another poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece of time -- this piece of the way it was almost lots of moments that was almost losing , OK ?
So , it was running out of the cards and was looking for the paper and the poetry was just in the walking through , and he was a matit in the washes , and then he said , " I was like to hold with the other hand the step .
And he was going to the poetry from the tail and he was put it in his body and turned it on the page .
And in these cases , the poetry would be presented on the perfect page and it 's going to the last word .
So when I feel that -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly equal to my process .
I 'm not a concreative process -- they 're not a condition .
I 'm a music , and my way to work is , and my way to wake up every day and I woke up and I 'm going to work and get a gotten .
But even I , in my head , I 've striped against that thing , sometimes .
And I imagine that many of you , the han fact .
You know , even if the work and ideas were saying , I would come up with a certain source I can 't even know .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we do you relationto extent us to do that , but , rather , rather , that does remains us ?
And as I look at , the best example of the contemporary example I have is the Tom Waits , which I interviewed a different day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of the artist returned that articking , trying to control , to control , to try to control , and to control these species of creative impulses .
But then I invest , he was calculation , and one day as he was driving on a car in Los Angeles , he changed all for him .
It was going to be fast and all of a tract tracks , and it comes up in his head , which comes into the inspiration , and it 's beautiful , and you want , you know , it 's wonderful , and it 's wonderful , and the desider , but not how to take it .
It has not a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a math , it has no register .
So , starts to feel this sort of old anxiety , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to lose , and I 'll have obviously obviously .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go in the panic , they stop .
It was the whole process of mental process and he made something new .
He just looked the sky and he said , " Have , you can 't see I drive ? "
" You know , it seems to write a song hour ?
If you really want to exist , you 're going back in a more opports when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , I walked to make any other today .
You can disturbing Leonard Cohen . "
And his process process of changed it after this .
I don 't work , the work was still dark like .
But the process , and the anxium anxium was reef when the genius , the genius that out of him causing it and fliberate it and fliberated it to remainly remained that they didn 't have to be an entientientirely , and I came back to .
but it was really this peculiar , beautiful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange and this strange and this strange and this strange and this strange and external was not Tom .
So , as the story beginning to change a little bit the way I was working and already saved me once .
This idea , I wrote , I writing " Mangap , Prega , " and cadds in one of those cave that we all cave when we 're working on something and we can 't start to think that it 's going to be a disaster , that 's going to be the worst book , that the worst ever written .
Not just bad , just the worst book written .
And I started thinking about guns this project .
But then I remember of Tom that I was talking about the air and I tried to us .
So I got my face in the hand , I realized my hands and I realized my hundred the writing corner of the room .
And I said to hear , " You know , what 's going to be , you both know that if this book is not going to be interest , not going to be any any , right ?
Because as I see I 'm going to put all I 'm going to put all I don 't have more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to present you and make your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , you know , I don 't do it .
I 'm going to write the same because it 's my work .
And I want to do for the middle that I 'm showed to do my part of the world , " because -- at the end is so , OK -- secoli ago in the deserts of the North people were raded for damage , and music that they were going to get a hours of the middle , and the sacred and hours .
And they were always magnificent , because the ballerins were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every one of them , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually .
And I know what I 'm talking about , because I know you you all saw it , at some point , a performance that .
It was like the time stopped , and the ballerin walked through a kind of a bral balls and wasn 't doing any different from the Sun , like 1,000 night-night-halls , but all of the way they were salling .
And suddenly not appeared as a human .
But you get up from the dierside and under the fire in the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , in the time , the people knew what they call it was , they call it the name .
They knew their hands and began to be canting , " Allah , Allah , God . "
That 's God , you know .
Curiosa known , when More invader the South Spain , I was this habites with their own and falls changed in the cholds , Allah , Allah , Allah , " Ole , " that 's " Ole , " that 's the " Ole , " you can hear in the rds or the floor .
In Spain , when a artest articulation has made something of a impossible and magic , " Allah , " By , " By , " claim , " incomprehensible , " incomprehensive , " Hise .
And it 's great because we need it .
But , the problem comes the day after , for the dancer , when you woke up and discover that they 're 11 of Martedyes , and I wasn 't there .
It 's just a bad with bad for ginoccurred , and maybe it will not ever get more to that height .
And maybe no one will be the name of God even as God still as it gets , and what is so you have to do with his rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful recognize to make a creative life .
But maybe it has to be so angood-being so angoss if you can 't believe , the most extraordinary aspects of your being come from yourself .
But you just think you have to come from a unimaginable source of this source of the source of your life that you have to get to somebody else when you 're finished .
And , you know , if we think that 's this way it changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly like I thought , I was a different months during the workers of the book I 'm going to published , spent , spent , I spent , I was going to follow my great success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel electric I feel by this is , not having .
Don 't get to . It 's just your work .
It 's a little bit of you , any way , any of course , any could be .
If your work is balling , ball .
If the divine , assurging genius to leave a few kind of wonderful , for one moment through your forces , for one moment through your efforts , then "
Otherwise , do the same your dance .
" Ole ! " You know , the same .
I think that I think you have to teach it .
" Ole ! " at you , even for the same , even for having loor of human heads to get you to continue .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And as you know I 've talked about some of these projects on the human genome , what can mean , and the discovery new genes .
Now we 're starting a new way : we started digitalizing biology and now now to start to the biology and now now we 're enting in a new phase of biology , designing and synthetizing life .
We 've always been trying to bring big questions .
" What is life ? " is something that many biologists I think they 've taken to figure out out .
We tried different approaches , reduced to the terms .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treating the analog of the world 's biology in the digital world .
Now we ask us : can we regenerate life , or create new from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest genitalium between those who can autoreum in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little more smaller .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of the 500 of the way I 'm here .
But when we look at his metabolic maps , it 's relatively respect to our .
I think that 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very improbasic that this can bring a living cells .
So , we decided that the only way to provide was synthetize this chromosom to get this cromodify to components to bring some of these things .
And so we started the adventure of " " Can we synthetize a chromosome ? "
What can you know about the chemistring of project to produce these big molecules that we never ever have to create before ?
And , in case , can we have a cromosome ?
A chemiddle is just a piece of chemist material .
The speed with which we are able to digitalive is growing to exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , rather , rather , procredit , rather slowly , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results the bring treme on a exponential curve .
We 've been started over 15 years ago .
The process process has require a lot of steps , beginning with a biothical review .
But we found that DNA synthetize that DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines in DNA , the longest segment of DNA , the letter of 30 to 50 letters and it 's a process : more the segment is longer , there are more rors .
So we had to develop a new way to make these fragments and running the errors and rors .
And this was our first threatens , to start digital information genome of Phi X 174 .
It 's a little viruses that kills kills .
We designed the fragments , we made the correction of errors and get a molecule of DNA , about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of chemistry material , and we put it in the bacteria , batterns , became batterns , and they 've involved the viral particles .
The viral particles have been re-up by the cell , are back and they disted the E. coli .
I talked about recently with members of the oil industry , that they have certainly compress that they have certainly compress this model .
They 've gone more than you .
We think this is a situation where software can actually build his hardware can actually build his hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in larger .
We wanted to build the whole cromosom of the bacterium .
They are more than 580 miles letters of genetic code .
So we thought we 'd build it in the size of the viruses , so that you could change the seven cassed for what the components are the cell of a living cells .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these are all these are to be very accurate .
When we sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard accuracy was a mistake for every 10 miles .
We found , resequency , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence . If we used that original sequence .
One part of the process is designing segments that are supposed to be survive with all the other segments of 50 letters to build the smaller and build the smaller and working together .
We try to do the only one here .
You 've probably read a little bit that we put on the filiguring .
Think of it : We have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , Gs and To .
Three of those letter men together code about 20 lots , and there 's a specific order to letters for every amount of reading .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frages , frages , thoughts .
What we did about the first was autographs .
Some of them were in the fact that it wasn 't poetry .
We designed these segments to just unhappy them .
There are enzymes that repair them and they put them together .
And we started assemble to assemble parts , beginning with five to seven miles , and they 're going to seven a little segments of 24 miles letters to get to 72 miles .
So , every step we produced these things in abundance , so that we 're trying to make a very cross-purely process -- you 'll see in a minute .
We 're looking for authomatizing the process .
So , this seems like the tabellon a lower played played .
When we get to come to these very long segments , more than 100 miles , they 're going to grow more directly in the E. coli .
It 's going to the limit of the modern tools of the molecular biology .
So we 've considered other mechanisms .
We know , we knew , mechanism called recombination , which in biology , which in biology is using biology to repair the DNA can une the segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , it can absorbed three million rad rad .
You can see in the sudden requarter as his chromosome come destroy-became .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly like it was before .
They are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms are completely seems to be completely .
They can live under vacuum .
They 're absolutely certain that life exist in space , and you move to find new water .
And in fact , NASA has shown that this happens .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built these processes , just using these processes with the design design appropriate .
The least assemble them assemble .
This picture was not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It 's a lot of this big , that we can see it with a law microscopy .
These are pictures that cover a period of about six seconds .
This is the published that we made a little time ago .
They are more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined structure that man 's ever created by the man .
It 's a lot of high high 300 million .
If we stamp it with a 10 within spaces , they would like 142 pages , they would like 142 pages to turn this genetic code .
Now , how do we do that ? How do we activate it ?
Of course , you know , a viruses is a game .
It 's a little more complicated when they 're using bacteria are using bacteria .
It 's also more simpler , when it 's eucariote like our : you can just extract the nucleus and put it up one more , which is basically the burn of clonation .
In the bacteria , the blue is instead of integrated inside the cell , but we have recently recently recently , we 've recently demonstrated that we 're able to make a transplant of a cell and activity .
We can reflowed a romosom participating from a species .
The two are different than men are as the men from topi .
We 've added a few gene in a way that choose to choose for this chromosome .
And then skies with the encies to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell was stupendent -- and you 're going to appreciate our own sophisticatogist -- the new cromosom was going into the cell .
And we were really thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we 've tried to spend more in there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that many species have added species have added a second or a hundred a second thousands of new tracks to a thousands of new tracks to that species .
So who think about evolution as a gene , as a gene at the time you can 't understand the biology of biology .
They are the enzymes called " restription that advantage of the DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cells that it was in the cells not possibly .
The cell phula-the cell that we 've inserit-hand-hand-up .
It 's expressed , and he recognized the other chromosom as expressed material , and we were rhythrow with only the cells and the new cromosome .
It 's blue because of the genes that we 've taken .
And in a short leaving of time , all the characteristics of a species are gone , and you turned out to a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cells .
All the proteins are changed , membranks are changed , and when we read the genetic code of exactly what we 've been taking to you .
Now , this might seem alchemistry , but it 's high the software , but it 's going to change things in a pretty much .
Now , I already explained that here is not talking about genetis -- but of progress to three million years and a half years of evolution , and I 've said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of the Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian explosion of this process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty obvious when we think about our needs .
We 're going to spend six and a half billion people in the next 40 years .
Right for example : I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each other in 1946 , there are there there are four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean water and balloon and gets for six billion and a half billion people .
It 's even more draw to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion bareas than 30 billion , more than 30 billion baries .
That means a million bareas a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to reduced them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep all the CO2 emission of these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
At day , because of the scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think they 're designed to think that are the designed for the future .
The electronics industry just just a dozen of components , and you think about how many different things are come out .
Our limits here are master data here , the reality of our imagination .
Now we have now , because of these techniques , because of rapids of synthesization , able to create what we call fighting genomics .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million cromosomes a day .
Think about this 20 million genes or different genes or to try to get the processes of processes or , new vaccines , new vaccines , new vaccines , and we can change , thank more molecular biology .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for a chance of survival , production , chemistry or or fuel , production ,
This is an instantaneous instantaneous instantaneous programmed that we 're working on for being able to seat and design species .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how they 're going to be .
We know exactly what they are genetic code .
Now we 're concentrating on the fuel of quarters .
You also saw you who are ethanol from the grate was a bad experiment .
We have fuels of second and third generation that will be surround-value cooking cooking , or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way the biology that can have a big impact without increase without increase the cost of food and limited the cost of food and limited the availability to transform CO2 in matter , and we think we can have this discovered , and we think we can have this discoverage , and we think we could have the first carbon as much of the generation in about 18 months .
The sunlight sunlight is a metodown-house -- but in our discoveries all over the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It 's in the ocean ocean , about 2500 feet of deep the temperature of the water .
They record from CO2 , using hydrogen molecular hydrogen energy .
We 're trying to figure out if we can incanalone , which can be easily to be transmitted by tubes , convert that CO2 in carburon , to drive this process .
So , we think we can be able to increase what we can increase the basic question of what is the basic question of what is life is . " And we have the comparison , we have the goal of rempize the entire industry .
Extally . If you don 't do it from TED , where can you ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And also , we 're working on to use the same metods to create vaccines .
You saw this year with influence , we 're always forth of a year and with a dollar in less when it 's about find the fair .
I think that that that 's going to change building vaccines in ancient ants .
So , this is how the future could start to look change , now , the tree of evolution , acceling the evolution with bacteria , and you 're finally getting eucariote .
We 're so much as the best people .
Our purpose is to be able to live long enough to try to make it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'll show you , the most rapidly possible , some fundamental work , the new technology that we took to the Microsoft , which is almost a year ago exactly exactly . This is Seadragon .
It 's a environment that you can interact is to local level that remote with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of gyte photographs with a kind of photos with a kind of zoom and continuous quote , disponing the pictures of how we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big amount of information that we see , as big these are collected or pictures .
Most of the photographs are digital photographs , but this is a scan from the Biblioteca Congress , and reenter in the migapie of 300 megapixel .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that limit the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a book , example of data is not images .
This is the Dickens of Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
For show you that it 's just about textbook and not images , we can do something like that , to make a real thing that 's about a real representation of the textbook , not a photographs .
It could be a way of artificial to read a book .
It 's not about it .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the Look .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and beautiful experience of a card-version , or a quotidian review or a quotidian , which is for a lot of half a lot of a half .
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of this particular number of the Guardian .
We created a fasules to higher solutionary advertising -- much more higher than that you use in a normal published -- and we 've insered you of the extra content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on screen .
We hope that means to put up and then you end up to the pop-up and other porcheries , not should be necessary .
Of course , the mapping is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if not say we have the contributes to give up in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. supply surprising a geospacectal picture .
So now we 're going to go to something else .
So this is actually actually , in the web ; you can go to the web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research for the computer , very interesting research from Noah Snavority of the University of Washington Steve Steve .
And it 's from Seb , gested by Seadragon .
You can see that when we do this kind of screen , where we can spend from a picture to the other and have this kind of experience and have this kind of experience .
But the space space collocation of the pictures here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization computers have registed these pictures together , so that correspond to the real place that the picture -- all scared up to the Grasis on Mountain of the Roccious canady -- they 've been taken down . So , you see the elements of a slightly leeps or imaging panic , and these are all the space of the space of the space of these things are all space .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some much more space .
I want to spend directly to one of the original data of Noahhitched by a prototype of Photosynthree-prototype of Photosynthers that we 've made to work for the first time , the Photosyth , technology , Photosyth , technology . And it 's not necessarily evident to look at the environments we 've put in the website .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so on .
This is a rebuild a rebuild the Notre of Notre Dame pictures from Flickr . Baast Dame in Flickr , and you get images of types in the maglights , other of the campus and so on . You 've got these concers a picture that you discovery .
So they are all pictures from Flickr and they were all connected to this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this way simple .
You know , I would never have thought I would never have thought about wind Microsoft .
It 's very gratifically to get this kind of across here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of types of different fields , from those phone phones to the professional SLR , a number significant number of meaning , in this environment .
And if I can I try to try and look for those strange .
And a lot of them are block , etc .
Somewhere there is a lot of photographs -- here it 's a series of photographs .
This is a Notre poster Dame recorrectly correctly .
We can go from the poster to the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This now is taking data from the ential memory of how the land looks like the land , from visual view -- and college all of those data together .
All those pictures become colleaged , the som of the parts .
You have a model of the land that 's emerges .
Think about this as a sounds of Stephen Lawler on Earth 's work .
It 's something that grows in complexity as people as they use , and the advantages for the use of the use .
Their pictures are hands with insert , and they are hundred people .
If someone is the idea of the idea of those draw saying the name , my photographs of Notre of Dame suddenly , you know , you know , and I can use it as a way of all of these data , and I can use the photographs in that space , in that metaphing the photographs of everyone else , and have a cross-mod-like social experience .
Of course , a consequence of this are virtual models of all the interesting model of the land , collected any part of the land , collective and satellitaries and satellitary , but from the memory collective .
Thank you very much .
CA : I understand good ? What your software will be able to do is that you can do is that a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs , all the photographs , all the photographs , will be all across the world ?
BA : Yeah . What 's doing is actually discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , you want , between images .
And it 's doing it in the base content of the pictures .
What 's really interesting if you think about the receive security of the semantic information that 's a lot of these images are able to .
As you do a research for pictures , you digit a frase and the text on the web page has a lot of information about the pictures .
Now , what if that pictures you lines to all your pictures ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of semantic and the amount of wealth that is really enormous . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible .
BAA : Thank you very much .
One of the main pileep pleasure when you travels and one of the ethnographics that doesn 't forget the anti-traditions , between the anti-traditions , between the wind the wind , the wind the piogges , the wind in the piogogy , wards the plants .
And , Basti think that Jaguar travel even beyond the Lattea , or that the mites of the Inuit are still a sense of meanings , or that in Himalayas , the buders are still going to remember the major of the machine , to remember the importance of the major , and that the idea that the world that the world in absolute , but it 's just a model of fact ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our own strops has done , right or a lot of generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
We all hidden . We 're all going to do .
We are subjects to return out of initiation .
We have to deal with the inexorability of death , so you don 't surprising and ballize --
We all have a art .
What holds is the special rhythm , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they are the Borneo 's Borneo , or the following Vooooodoo Haiti , or the guerriers of the Ksut in Kenya Stentries , or a cammate in the Ande , or a cammamazing in the Sahara .
He was my own journey of trip in the desert of a month ago , or a yak of the gyak valley in the Everest , the dead of the world .
All of these populations teachers are teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of displs in the world .
And , if you reflect a second , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
Insized , my cultures of cultures in the world , they create a spiritual life and cultural and cultural that we fly , and cultural well-being on the planet as the planet as the ragela .
And you can think of this cultural ragnature as a clean and you can defining the ethnosfic sum , the total ethnosphere , dreams , inspirations , ideas , inspirations , inspirations , inspiring , inspiring , inspiring , inspiring , inspiring ,
The etnosfhere is the patrimony of humanity .
It 's the symbl of what we are and what we can be in as a species .
And because the biosphere was free consumed by the way , they were very quickly ethnosfurely .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species was or is on the oref of the extinction of the extinction , because it 's false -- in the most optic diversity -- and you don 't even even close close closer to the most optimistic diversity .
The indication of all that is , of course , the loss of the language .
When you were born in there were 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not just composed by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the shake of the human spirit .
It 's the middle with which the animal of every culture is coming in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a little bit of mind , a spiritual chance .
And those 6,000 languages , as we sat in Monterey , at least half is not more surrounded in the ears of children .
They don 't come more teached to children , which means , unless you won 't walk , which they 're already dead .
What is more sad than being the silence of being the silence , of being the last to talk to a language , not have a way to transmit the wisdom of the children or advance ?
This orring was the state of some of some world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , a old old old moment and brings with the ulars of the last syllabs of a ancillabs .
And I know somebody to say , " Isn 't it ?
The world would be a better place if we talk about all the same language ? " Well , then we talk about all yoruba . We are saying cantonese .
Let 's talk kogs .
You 'll cover a tract thing means that you can 't talk to talk to their language .
I 'd like to do a journey through the etnosh --
a little journey in the ethnosfied to give you a little bit of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of existing existing " different ways of existing .
Let 's take for example , this baby Barasana , in Amazon settettle-acony , the popular of the anacond 's walking from the latte of the swalking of the site in the site of the site in the swest sacred .
It 's a popular popular that is not to distinguish the blue because the green time cell is identified in the time of the forest , where the forest depends the popular .
They have a strange language and a gain , detailed " exogament " " " " " You have to move a different language .
All of that radical has a language in the past , though the particularity is that in these families that are talking about six , or seven language of marriages , no one practices no practices .
They 're all to hear and they start to talk .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Worani Eastern Easter , a popular popular that has the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionary missionaries have taken a facing mistake .
They 've made out of the photographs that were were rushed in a few who were trichevolves , forest that this population population of pluvial forest .
They collected the ground of the land , they spend them in a shape or a figure and , not find nothing , they have concluded that they were treated with the oddly , and they killed the five missionaries with the lance .
But Waorani are not only killed the straneyesterday .
They killed to them in their own .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We 're risalites to get generations and we found two cases of natural death and when we stroyed to know , they 've been invited to know , they 've been admit to be aging , and then killed it the same . [ Rate ] As ] Home , any way , they had a knowledge of the forest .
The cuts were able to recognize the animal from 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the first ' 80s , I was assigned a very interesting tasks when my professor Harvard asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti in the middle society of Duvalier , and the Tonton Macoutes and the Tonton Macoutes and the Tonton Macoutes , and imssessare of the speed to make the wodddly used to make the zoom .
To make a sense of miracy , I would have to understand the Vodoun culture that Vodoun 't magnitude .
It 's pretty much of a complex metaphysical view of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Heesimum , Islam , Budddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent comes up , and they 're just just just thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious figure out . And instead of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of these religious concept of these religious concepts of slavery .
What makes interesting about the voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , you know , the spirits are born .
The spirits can be invited by the Great Acqua , they respected to the dance of the dance of the dance of the vive and they replace in a short way that for a brief active to be the following the goes .
So , for this voodooists are saying , " You know white white you go to a talk about God .
We say in the temple and divention and divention . "
And from the moment you are , is the spirit that you can do the event you , how can you do you do ?
So you 're looking at these incredible events : followed followed voodoo in the state of trance that touches are infuel , rather strong demonstration of the power of the mind on the body when it catalyzed in a state of extreme extreme .
And in all the populers with which I lived the most amazing of the Sierra Nevada de Sierra Marta de Sierra Marta , in the Colombia sector .
It turns out to be a very tiranna civilization that once living on the piece of Colombia in the conquirst , the popular was a massive population that you errate on the piece of the piece of the piece .
In a mackicked continent , this popular , this popular was never conquisted by the spagnology .
And now they are governed by a clerged , but their formation is really extraordinary .
The young people are followed by the families to three or four years , and they live secregated in a world made of a buy and homes in a world of base pone of the ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years choices to reproduce the nine months of gestation that turn in the user of the mother , now are metaphor in the user of the Great Mther .
So , for all of this time , they come accultural values of their society , values that they are predict and just their predict and their predict , they keep the cost of their own ecological balance .
At termine of this incredible initiation , they 're taken taken out and for the first time in their life , in the age of 18 , they see a tremendous high . And in that accountered the beautiful valley , when the sun of the beautiful beautiful valley , all of the beautiful , all of all of the splay , and he says ,
" Visle ? I said , " I said .
It 's stupendent . It 's about you protect it . "
It 's called the major fratels and they say that we , brothers , we are the colputs of the world .
This unction level is extremely important .
When we think about the populations and we think about the environment and the old story of the noble noble story , which is a razy concept in his simplicity , or maybe we 're going to be in the neighborhood in the Earth of us .
The populs are not niture feels , nailed by the nostalogy .
There is no space for these things in the disease or the high of the Astststage or the gelids of the Tibet , but because of the time and the rites , they created a mistic Earth 's not on the concept of being known to be closer , but on a bleep willing , but on a bleep pural intuition : the concept that Earth can only live in the consciousness .
What does that mean ?
It means that a kid of Ande that a boy of Ande that grows up that the mountain is a spirit that will drit his destiny is going to be a different deep and it will have a different relationship with the mountain or that place to have a little bit of Montana , and it 's going to be switch a baby of Montana who are taking a bunch of being scared .
That 's the dimtained a mineral was irrifting or was irrifting .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the methaphor the natural world .
I grew up in the forest of the Columbia British Columbia creding that the forest services to be wrong .
And that 's made me a human being a different from my friends Kwakiutl that believe that the forest forests are the Hukuk and the stories are the Hukukils and the stories of the paradise and the donibal cannights that live in the world , explain that they live in the early the Hamateful beginning .
If you start to look at that these cultures can actually create different reality , you can start to understand some of their sensitive discoveries . We take this piece of plant .
I took this picture to open in the north-Ca-doccipitched photographs .
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayahuasks , the most powerful such of the sciamount of you have heard of the sciamount of you have heard of the sciamount of you have heard of the sciamount of you have heard of the game of the game of you have heard of the sciamount of you have heard of the sciamount of the game of you have heard of the sciamount of the gone of you have heard of the gahuasks , the most powerful ,
What makes the playahuashuashuashuasks is not the physical potential of the such . It 's composed to two elements .
It 's a moon , this leavily , this leaving leaving series , harmine and harmine , slightly halls .
And I take the solar plant is a blue that a little blue that it 's a little bit of consciousness , but it 's michoices with the leaves of the coffee said , " Psychotridis said .
This is contains sad powerful plant , very similar to the serotonin the mithoxyltryltryltryltryltryptamine .
If you ever see Yanomami , you know , you know , the sustainance that they do a different set of species , anchy extended methoxyltryptamine .
And then that polly-walking for the nose is a little bit like being disappeared by a fire cartile of pink , and we can get up on a sea of electricity .
I woften I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who takes the psychephysical fungi in the ' 30 in Mexico .
I think of course , my thesis , you can 't be classified to be hallucinogens because if you 're not going to tell any of being told .
It 's possible to absually if you just just just a little bit of them with other chemicals that money the MAs .
Now , it 's beautiful : : People who are are in this liana , MAs , the same kind of the MAO , the same kind of potential to be able to be . The question is , in a floating of 80,000 species of plants , like these people are doing this , but if you combine a few died , but if you combine , that if you combined a way , create a biochemistry version that 's sumer ?
We use the big eupherified and error , that can reveal it .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " The plants are talking about . "
What does that mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , the Cofan , has 17 variety of lobe , who distinct , and that our eyes would be realized in the same species .
If we asked him how they are they 're going to be able to say , " I thought I would say , " I think I can 't know all the piant , I don 't know all ? "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night of late and each night with a different .
And that doesn 't have a car to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that contributs .
Now , [ [ [ ] ] the problem is that even the problem is that even the people who have heart people who are in their ingenes , but in some way to the margins of the story to the real world , and it 's even even even even even a way .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it will not remember for his driver or its technologies , but rather like the was where we stopped and we used actively , and we have actively , and we have active or accepted the mass destruction of the planet .
All the cultures through the secles were involved in a dance for new life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians have no stopped to be Sioux when they put out and fit and falls as Americans don 't stop being Americans when they don 't stop being American people when they put out of the caveling and calculations .
It 's not the change or technology , which is the integrity of ethnosfhere .
The hard of domination .
And if you look at the world , you 'll find that these are not cultures are cultures .
They are living and dynamics and dynamics , the existence of identific existence that go beyond their adaptation .
And that 's the disbowsters in the patria of the Penan .
a popular no-made popular Sarak , in the Souast , a popular who lived free to the forest in the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to the servites of the rive , where you can see the river of the rive of the rive , where you can see the wills of the naves , the navels of the navels , where the navels of navels ,
To you take the stage wood the wooowner with the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that are the discovery of the discovery of the gold .
If we move on the mountains of the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the hard of political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physical extinction of a popular , it 's condamn to the lower level , but the ethnocide destruction of the lifetnothing , it 's not just condent , but even even even even a certain environments , because it 's part of the development of the development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet of the Tibet , until you 're part of the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in the China in the Cina Tibet South , through the South East , with a young message , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what we have to hear about .
6,000 sacres sacres in polly-hand-to-hand-hand-to-hand-hand-to-hand-hand-to-hand-hand-to-hand-handle monuments in polly-hand-to-hand-hand-hand-to-hand-hand-to-hends .
1.2 million people killed by the military military people are killing the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical to the Panchen Lama .
which means it was killed to the time of the Chinese Inasion .
Her , it 's smoke with Sua Santity during the diaspora that led the popular in Nepal .
Her mother was impresoned and his college was getting rich .
It was brought to hidden in the age of two years born under his gonna because it wouldn 't live without him .
The sister , who did the same , was put in a reeducation .
One day has walked up a day , a fascinated fascinating Mao and , for this transgression , was put to the works of the works for seven years .
The pain of Tibet can be insometimes , but the spirit of the popular population is from the popular .
At the end , all of all you reduces a choice .
We want to live in the world monocromatics or want to according the world or we want to acked the world policymatic ?
The big anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he die said that his biggest scaren , in our own fear , not just see the entire gamm of human imagination , not just see the entire gamm of human imagination , but one day we 're going to woke up from a sone-forgoes out of a sone-burniture .
And it 's umillion of remember that our species is existed for 60,000 years .
The Neolitics Rivolution , who gave us the agriculture , who has made us to be able to the cult of the seed of the seed , they 're doing the poetry of the sler , creating the gerarching gerarchy of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industrialized has been 300 years .
That several story not suggests that we have the answers that we have the answers that we have to do to get into the millenny to come .
When these miriades of cultures are asked what you want to say to be human , they say , they say with 10,000 different voices .
And that 's in these answers that all risky the possibility of being what we are : a consciously , that has to make all the people and all the gardins can fiore . And there are big moments of optimism .
I took this picture on the northrow the north of the island of Baffin , when I went to hundred the hundream of of the Holas , Olaya , Olaya , he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The canadly was not always gentle with the Inuit and in the ' 50s and in the ' 50s , we have running them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man was refused to go .
The family , I temention , and took him all the arms , and all of his reaches .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't teach the cold , the disorder .
The bad blue were made of fishes were made of heavens .
The grandfather was not intimid-night or the library or the library , or the library that was such .
It 's butting out of the blood pantalons in the skin in skin and focused in the hand defected in their hand . When the blue they 've been congelated , they 've been congelated , and they 've been conglama .
It 's spred on the door of this caccept of this caccept and when I came , he killed a dog .
He 's taken the dog and created a blue , with the cash cass created a sledaughter , and it 's disappeared on the buckling , and it 's disappeared on the ballower .
We want to talk about cavary-taking . And this , in different ways , [ Applausi is the symbl of the popular popular ] ] ] ] ] [ S] ] ] [ the ] ] ] [ the ] ] ] ] [ the ] ] ] ] [ the ] ] [ the ] ] ] ] ] [ Applauses ] .
In the 1999 , the canadly Inuit has reached the total control of a territory area of a larger area of the larger California and Texas .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's a territory of independent . They all the mineraries .
One splends of how a nation-state can recognize with his popular popular .
And , finally , I think it 's pretty obvious obvious at least who of us was in these remote zones of the planet , remote that they don 't have been remote .
For someone is home .
They represent sections of human imagination that they are treat the high of the time . And for us all , the dreams of these kids , like dreams of our children , become part of the hope .
For finally , we are a National Geographic , we are convinced that politicians will never get to nothing .
We think the polemiics --
[ Applauses ] they 're not persuasive , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell stories of the world . Every month of our site . Every month of our website .
156 countries transmit our television canal canal canal .
Our reaches are laughters of millions of people .
Our work is travel to ethnosfic exists to bring our audience in a world of cultural amazing , they 're going to be able to be , and hopefultops , they 're going to be able to be in the middle of the anthropology : the world 's world 's going to exist in a world and multicultural .
where the wisdom of all the populers can contribute to our wisdom well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some of some things I wrote in this book that I hope you 've already heard and try some links , in case not nothing about them .
I want to start with what I call " the dogma dogma . "
The dogma official dogma of what ?
The dogen official dogma of all societies , the dogma dogma dogma is , " If we want to massive citizens , " The way to do it is massive citizens . "
The reason is , from a side , in fact that freedom is in the same a value , it 's precious , useful , it 's precious , useful , essential for human beings .
And in the other is that if we are free , each of us can act for all of us can act for doing all that we massive , without any nobody that decided to be our well-being , no one that decided to be in our name .
The way to massive freedom is massive freedom .
More choices people have , more liberty , and more liberty is their liberty , the major is their well-being .
This , I think , is so deeply radicated in society that no one would have to be able to put it in doubt .
And it 's also deeply radicated in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I 'm going to get a simple note about conditions .
In my supermarket , there are 175 conditions , without contention 10 variety of oil and 12 acetes and 12 hundred huge , and 12 huge , and 12 acetes of the figure out in the field that no one of the 175 of your degree .
Here 's what supermarket is the supermarket .
Then you go to the electronics to buy a stereo stereo : cases , radio , radio , radio , radio , piece , pialeft , practice .
And in this single negoties in this single negoties , there 's a big number of components .
We can make six million and a half a different way of combinations using the components that there are only in a store .
You have to admit 's a lot of choice .
Althids : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the phone services the desire , to purbable , to putting that were forniture from mom Bell .
It was for the phone , they didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , between the other , was that the telephone was not breaking .
These days are gone .
Now , we have a variety of telephones , especially between the phones .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is in the middle , MP3 , tops , and he shapes of the nass , and foreign to the crowd burn .
If you don 't even seen that in the store in the store , you 're going to be able to be .
And what 's happening is that people are in the stages and the question . And you know , you know , the answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the bud-aquency , you true choices .
Ausements , healthcare : it doesn 't happen in the United States you walk out and doctor , you know what you have to do .
Instead , I won the doctor , and doctor says , " OK , we can do . A , or B , " has these benefits and these risks , " Big has these benefits and these risks . What do you do ? "
You say , " Dottore , what would I do ? "
And the doctor says , " Holar has these benefits and these risks , and B has these benefits . "
" What do you do ? "
And you can say , " Doctor if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not she . "
The result that we call it " autonomy , " expression that it seemate it looks like a beautiful thing .
But it 's not that a moving the fish and responsibility to take some decisions that something knows the doctor , to any other than all of -- and almost of course , it 's almost certainly , and so not in the ideal condition to take the patient .
There 's a huge marketing products , direct people , direct people like me and you , that if you think that doesn 't have any sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do they say ?
The answer is that they want to doctor , we call the doctor for ask to change the rich .
Something is that 's our identity is a hydrop , is a question of choice , as you see in this vision , " We don 't want to force children . We don 't want to be a identity . " We don 't want a more identity : We don 't have a identity : We need to invent it .
And we can reinventing a lot of time .
That means that every morning , at the risveiled , you have to decide that kind of person you want to be .
I realized the family and marriage , a time , a time the common perspective , almost of almost , and it was that you were sitting the most possible possible , and we started to start to make the most possible possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not when , and even what to do after .
Or day , all is really to play .
I 'm a very intelligent students , and I do 20 percent , and I 'm 20 percent of work respect to a time .
And not because they 're less brilliant , not because they 're less diligent .
but why are they impansit , I mean , I should ask , " I should be smart or not ? "
" I should be smark ? I have to think before the or the career ? "
They are interrogatives .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even though this implessing , even though this implessing and not get a beautiful vote to my own own .
And they really have to do it . They are important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl soft , because technology allows us to work every day , every day , every day , from every corner of the planet , transply-Randolds .
And in parently , there 's a corner , and I don 't tell you , where the WiFi works .
I don 't say , because I want to use it .
What means , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about the work ? Is we have to continue , and if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our child , with the cell phone in a tank , the Blackberry in the other , and the notetextbook , and the noteteteeth .
And even though they are spent , every minute that we see our child , we 're also asking , we 're also asking , " I have to answer to this call ? "
" I have to say to this email ? "
And even when the answer is " no , all of this makes the experience of your child very different from what would be in other conditions .
So , any part of the little bit of the big , little things , and large materials and life is a question of choice .
Once the world was this : Obvious , there were some possibility , but not all was a choice .
The world of today is it looks like this : The dilemma is , " Is it a positive thing , or negative ? "
The answer is , it 's Should you be able to be .
The positive sons of them , so I 'm going to talk about the negative ones .
All this choice two negative effects two negative effects on people .
The first , paradoxtially , is that produces instead of liberation .
With options of the options of choose , it becomes very difficult to do it .
I 'm going to give you a meaning example : a conducted study plans of voluntary pension furniture .
A colleagues had access to the data of the Vancide , the globe of pension , with about a million clients of deep entered in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are taking in more , the lower lower lower car slater than two percent .
With 50 sources , there 's 10 percent in less adesions than when they are available to when they are available . Why ?
Because with 50 sours of flows , is sick , it 's sick to decide , and choice is remains .
And at questions , and I still have questions , questions , questions , and of course , and questions , and of course , and questions never get .
You know that doesn 't only means that these workers are going to hate food because they don 't have enough money , it means that the decision is so ostics that they 're also going to say that the decision is so ostics that they lose the funding of the work .
They 're not going to talk , they 're losing to five dollars for year from the dator of work , which would be really disposes to be them .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world .
" And finally , for ethernity : ketchup , senape or maionese ? "
You want to take the right decision , if it 's for the ethernity , right ?
You don 't want to choose the source , and nepuring the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that if we can get the paralysis and do a choice , we 're less sitting , we 're not sitting out of the result of how we would choose .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with lots of conditions are , if you buy , and it 's not perfect , it 's really good , it 's not perfect , and it 's not perfect to be better . And what 's going on the alternative crowds , and the display the drug of choice , and the diminishing the souldn 't have perfect to be a different choice ,
And even when it was a good decision .
The choices there are , easier is easy to dispile of any detailable than option of choice .
And also , there 's what economists call constood called constood .
Dan Gilbert has asked very well as a lot of stamatter that we think about depends what we do .
In the rest , when there are a lot of options , it 's easy to represent the characteristics of the option that you have to be less sitting and be less sitting .
Here 's an example . I school with all the people who are not New York .
But that 's what you probably think about it .
There 's this couple to Hamptons .
a place of luses .
It 's beavails . Oten day . It 's all about them .
Not any way . But what he thinks is , " Well , malth , it 's Augofts . "
" All my neighbors are in Manhattan are forth . "
" I could talk to just talk about front of home . "
And it 's two weeks , the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the chance of parking for -- the chance of parking where it wants .
The constood is the excellent opportunity is , even when choice was excellent .
And more are the options that we have to look at the more , the characteristics are going to be able to be .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things tells us .
It 's about living the moment , and maybe the living slowly .
But the most important point is that any thing you choose to do , you know , you know , you 're not to do other .
The things that we don 't choose are active attractive than we can make less attractive what we do .
And third : it 's growing up for expectations .
I tried to my skin beating a new jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were just a kind of a guy , buy them and bought them , they were discovered , and they were dissimed , and they were clean to go well .
So , I went to buy a couple again when the old old were went , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The committed said , " You want to do it , easy fit , heasy fit ? "
You want to want to the buttons or with the bottons ? " " You know ? "
" Do you want to do them ? "
" Sotto them wants to do it . The blaw ? Buddge ball .
I was sitting , and after a little bit , and after a little bit of , I could say , " I want the guys that was the only kind of , " had no idea what it was , so for a hour jeans , and then I came out of the jeans , and then I came out of the jeans that I ever had .
It was the massive . And all that choice , I had got the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand that .
The reason I was worse , I was that with all the west aspectations were very high , jeans had to be perfect .
And I was wait . I didn 't expect minime . I wait . I wait . I wait , when it 's just a kind of a kind of thing , at least a kind of kind of thing , at least a guys had to be perfect .
What I was burniture was good , but not perfect .
After I had compared that chosen with what I was trying to be wind comparison the expectations .
The add options in life of people don 't do that increase the expectations that these are respect to the options that these options have respect to the options that these options are going to the excellence of the same .
And this will produce less sflication , even when the results are good .
None in the world of marketing if you realize it .
Because if they knew , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth looks more like this .
" It was better when he was worse , " The reason it was better when it was worse was better when it was worse was that when it was worse was even worse , you can meet the surprised pleasure .
Ofday , in the world that we live -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the expectancy of perfefeeling , the things are at the height of expectations .
You never surprised , you 've been surprised because your expectations , my expectations are ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- that 's , " Basse expectations , " Yes , you want to do it . "
I mean , little autobiographic moment -- that I 'm really sitting and my wife is really stupend .
I couldn 't have to do better , I don 't have accounted .
But you don 't always have a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of the comprate a couple of jeans is that when you don 't satisfied , and you say , " Why do you ? "
" Who is responsible ? " " And the answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What I could I do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a lot of them , and you ask you who is the responsible , it 's the responsible , it 's a hundred responsible to you .
You might have been able to do better .
With hundreds of available variety , there are no scuses for the insuccess .
So when people are decisions , even though the result is , they feel unsitting and they 're sitting and give the colors to them .
In the last few years , the depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- this honey , but that honto do is that people have the experiences of the people have experiences because the standard is too high .
And when they explaining this situation think that the college is they think that colors are .
So the final result is that we 're better , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not true .
There is no doubt that a little bit more choice is better than haven 't really affected , but it doesn 't have a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what it 's .
But I 'm sure that we 've taken a piece of the level where choices are better our life .
Now , from political point -- I almost finished -- I almost finished -- the political noccise is the following .
What 's allows all this choice in industrial society is the material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , that the problem is not they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too poor too poor .
So the face of the facility I 'm talking about is a while modern exclusive society .
And what makes and the arrare is this : Steve Levitt talked about how much yesterday and discovers and discovers for bombs are inuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuseful .
I mean , these choices , complicated and dispendious , it 's not just unuuuuuseful .
They are advantage of etheries .
They do it stay worse .
If a little bit of what in our society allows society allows was reversed in those where people have too much possibility , not just be their lives , but also our own life .
This is what economists call a paretian paretian improvement .
A redistribution of redent does well , not just to be the poor -- because of this choice in excess that you go back .
To conclude , " Let , you can become everything you want , "
You know , people of culture , you think , " What does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make it in a glass . "
" A castrated imagination , a limited vision of the world , "
And I 'm going to do that , at the beginning .
But then , think about it , instead , I realized that fish the long gets .
Because the reality of fact is that if you eat the boat , the boat , so that " all you can 't get the freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the boat in a way that all you can die .
You get the paralysis , and you can reduced the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too much , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the assons of some symbolic symbolic sphere is a recipe for infections .
Thank you very much .
