The last year I showed these slides to demonstrate the artical calots , which for almost three million years has had the size size of the United States continental , it 's retroded for 40 percent .
But this underground gravity , because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice of the ice .
The Acial calots is , in a way , the clear heart of the global climate system .
It 's expanding winter and you reverse summer .
The next next slide is going to be a quickly carler on the last 25 years .
The ice lost are signed in red red in red .
You see , you see , they expand they 'll expand the dark .
That 's the ice in the winter , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
You can see that the ice cosid-inner cosidynamic , five years , is like the blood , which is like the blood here .
In 25 years , it 's spent by this .
This is a problem because the heats of the interest in the glacier around the arctic way that there are enormous quantities of coal congeled that , the huge amount of coal congeled , they 're transformed into the microbes .
I 'm going to push to the totality of global warming , that quantity could double , superate this point of not return , super-a-scale .
In some lay lacks , in Alaska , in the methane is already stayed by the water .
The professored Katey Walter of Alaska of Alaska , we 've got a team with a team , at the last night .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You 're good . You 're going to be .
A reason is that this third exchange Greenland Greenland from the northern .
This is a glacial river .
The ported was never reached similar .
This is the Kangerlushers in the souest of the Greenland .
If you want to know how it is the level of the sea level of ice , the melting of the sea , here is where it reaches the sea .
These corrups are increasing rapidly .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the biggest block of the planet .
The last month of the scientists have gone that the ice of the ice of ice is in the negative , and the Antarctica , which is in the Western Antarctica , is particularly rapid .
Exide six meters of the level of the actor , like Greenland .
On Himalayas , the third biggest block , you see new lay , which few years ago were tuned , that few years ago were glaciers .
40 percent of the world 's population will be population half of the water 's slightly from the slightly huge .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the source of this city .
The ported is increased .
But when it demining , it 's the same happens to the populable water .
In California the snow on the Sierra Nevada is diminily 40 percent .
The idrics are in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , I 'm graves .
The growing powerful growing in the world leads to a remarkable increasing incendes .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm out of the normal and without precedental .
Four times over the last 30 years , in the last 30 years , I respect 75 .
This is a whole thing about all unsustainable .
If you look at it in the historic consequences .
In the last five years , we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look attentially the East Pacific , the Americas , from the Americas , to the American , west , and on both the size of the Indian , where there 's a radical impoverighbors of the oceans .
The biggest causes of global warming , with the deforestation , which is 20 percent of fossil fuel use .
The oil is a problem , and coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with China .
And it was proposed to build a lot of coal other central central .
But we 're seeing to a change of direction .
These are the annoulated projects in the last few years and some evidence of versus .
Every way , there is a politics in our country .
The coal and oil and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year for promote coal publishing coal publishing coal .
And this picture was going to reminded me something --
With the Natal Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion gloss of coal switches .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second largest flow of scories in America .
It happened to the Christmas .
The nature of one of the coal of the coal industries was this .
Video : Without of the carbon is a kind of happy and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and growing our economy .
Frosty the carbon is more and more puzzle .
It 's a good price , adorable and workers keep the styptic .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the coal of the West Virginia .
The biggest minerary society is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reeeal , they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alliance for the Projection of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is a part of them , a part .
Video : Atter : Aftor : Aftor we see climate change as a threat to our business .
And for this priority is to investing a great amount of money in a effort of public to make public and confused the truth to make public and confused the truth .
In fact , coal is not sporous .
We think it 's cleaned -- it also has a good smoke .
So , not precocupateves of climate change .
Let 's do it .
Video : Atter : Carbone . You 've heard about it .
So let 's take a turn into a turn on the street of the clean , and it 's about coal publishing .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noise , but this is the sound of technology is clean technology .
The coal consumption is between the main global warming , but the remarkable technology , but the night of the publishing that you see changes everything is changing .
You have a look , this is the clean technology of coal publishing .
Al Gore : Indeed , the alternative , the positive security connects to economic security .
Video : The America is in crisis in crisis ; the climate security , the climate crisis .
The fighting that all of us : our dependence of fossil fuel , as coal fuel and the imported oil and the imported oil .
Now , there 's a new , though , there 's a new solution for used .
Repower America : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
And a plan to put America to work out of the work , make sure , and help help stop global warming .
And it really , a solution that you would have to solve our problems .
Repower America . Scover more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's about re-in-handing energy .
One of the fastest ways to bring dependence on the dependence that kill our planet .
What does it do is here . Solls , solar , a new energy energy .
What does it do to do is , you know , workers to be workers .
Comvvvae . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A proverbial African says , " If you want to go fast , you go down to the alone .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
The last year at TED , I did an introduction on the LHC .
And I promise to return to advancing to how the car works .
So , there I am . And for those that the other time , there was the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever -- 27 miles of circuit .
His task is to remember the conditions that were presents less than one billion second of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
This is just environments to just the way .
This is the car under Ginevra .
We spent these mini-Big Bang inside the relatively .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLAS -- is larger 44 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building , so you can see the proportions .
Ten September 10 last year we have accesuate the car for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was causes of immense festern control room .
It 's a picture of the first particles that had done all the LHC -- coming into collision , coming into collision , of collision , with a part of the LHC HC , and spread particles into the record .
In other words , when we saw that picture 10 September 10 , we knew that machine worked , which is a great vegetables .
I don 't know if that was this to do exultent us more or this , when someone went on to Google and saw that the initial page was this .
That means we have a cultural impact beyond the scientific .
It was a week later , there was a problem with the car , you know , to these dored dored dored here -- these dored dored dored .
These files leave 13,000 ampers bring up when the car works at the power of the power .
Now , the technicians between you look at the children and say , " It 's not true . I 'm too much lost . "
And they can do it because they 're very cold , when they 're very cool the superconductors .
So at less 271 degrees , at a under temperature to the wore of the space between the stars , these files can bring that current .
In one of the juntures of the most noveils in the LHC , there was a fabrication of fabrication .
So the flowers flights , and the 13,000 amps , and the 13,000 amps , they met a electric resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnets more than 20 tons , and that have been moving about 30 centimeters , and that have moved about 30 centimeters .
They 're going to have about 50 magnets .
We had to take them , what we had to do .
We restined and adusted them .
Now they 're going back all to their place underground .
I mean , the end of march the LHC will be again .
We 'll accinate it , and we expect to get the data to jumped data , and continue our adventure to find out what the morning to find , what the morning are the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents reaccend the debate of science and engineering value of science and engineering . It 's easy to confuture .
I think that 's so difficult to go beyond the limits , I think that 's value of things like the LHC .
I want to end with the words of a Inglese scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , imagine , in defense of his experiments of his puppiley , the inuses was Michael Faraday , he said , " Nient is so dangerous for the human mind of how the human mind is , that there are not a very dangerous , and there are not a result of our tripackage , and there are not a souldn 't be completely , and the spounds of the worldangervous , and there are not completed , and there are not .
Thank you .
I want to start with you to rethink of when children , you 're playing with children , play with you .
And as you get to understand them , and they 're going to get them , and get them and move them , learning to think and solve problems and manipulating problems and manipulating relationships .
The space is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , as we use the computer inspired by our physical objects , with my physical objects , with my consulting Patts , and my collaborator Jeevevan Kalanithi , I started asking , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only cursor of the policies , we can deal with physics , and we can deal with physically a descend information with the both of the both of the both of the both of the hands .
and sistemle to our pleasiment ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a big interactive computer .
In a few words , a Siftable computer is a big interactive computer .
You can see them moving with your hand , they can see " between them , you know their movement and they have a radio and a radio screen and a radio .
But most most of them , I 'm physical objects , you can just move it to just further .
The Siftable is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they become more physical , consciously , the other , as the other , and as they become more physical , consciously , the other way , the movement of the other way , how we move , we can explore new and fun interaction .
I 'll start with some simple example .
This Siften is configurated to show the video : if you including it in a direction , video standing like this , if you can including the other side back .
These interacts are the interacts .
If they fall , they 're interested in what they 're around .
If they come around , they notice it and they can be .
If they come around , they notice it and they can be .
They have also been their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use communicate data , for instance , " " " " " " " " " " a color as if it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurated as a seck of vernice and I can use them to color in the central color in the central , where they mix .
and I can use them to color in the central , where they mix .
We can do it , we can reverse it , we can put a little bit of place .
There 's also a very beautiful possibilities of learning , like languages , mathematics and games where people can try and see the result things quickly , and see the immediately results of it .
Now , I 'm --
This is a Fibonacourselves I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a word of words that is half between Scarabeo and Boggle .
Every , at every turn to the letter , you get a letter to every Siftable , you get a letter to every dock on every Siftable , and while you 're trying to understand words control about a dipactable , and while you 're trying to understand words control on a direct .
Then , after about 30 seconds , they remiss , and you have a new set of letters and new chance to try to try .
Thank you .
And here 's the children came up to the Media Lab , I did it tried them and made it and turned a video .
They were very peleed very much .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people many education .
You 've just say , " Comptions of words , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's the other people who try it .
This is our own own younger , there on the right there .
It was actually just to impilate them .
They were only doing the morning , for him .
Now , this is a chardter of a cardboard .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of the Lui is Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Siftable to their associated .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Siftable to their associated .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sun is sunlight .
David Merrill : Now it has taken a treat the scene .
Video : The arancient treator .
So , you know , you know .
So I school , I school the Siftable and put them neighbors can interact their characters --
Video : Bau !
and by making their own story .
Video : Hao !
DM : It 's a story with the open open . And it can decide him how they fly engaging .
DM : It 's a story with the open open . And it can decide him how they fly engaging .
Video : Voly , golden .
DM : The last example I have time to show you a tool , is a tool , realized , to walk and execectent music .
is a tool , recently , to truly truly truly , to exececture music .
Siftable here act of sounds like battery , based and bacteria .
Every one of these has four different variations , and you can choose to which use .
You can also insert these sounds in a sequence to competition .
And they just make it simply by touch a " and a sequence .
These are effects that you can control from the alive , like reverberal and filter .
It 's a particular sound and then including to address .
And then there are the general effects as time and fly , which you 're applied to the whole sequence .
We look at how it works .
Video : DM : We 'll start putting a base in two Siftable " sequence , we 're going to get the basic . We extend to the other base .
Now I put a line of low line .
Video : DM : Now I 'll add some sense --
Video : And I 'll put the battery to the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the alive .
Video : DM : I can quence the whole sequence of the whole sequence by the time by one side .
Video : And I 'll tell you the filter to the flow to the flow to get more expression .
Video : DM : I can tell the flight .
So I don 't have to planning it first , but I can improvising it , and then I can improvising it , longer .
And now , finally , I can sequence the whole sequence inclinking to the left Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new human interface . And so it 's going to be more like our brain and the body work .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the result of this patterns , and also some chance that we try to bring out the lab .
The concept I want to transmit is that we 're coming up with this new generation of objects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world as we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writer .
Site books is my profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also the love and the fascine of my life .
And I don 't expect to be change .
But , I said , something particular happened to recently in my life and my charrier , which brought me to realibrate the whole report of this work .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called " Mangist , People , Ama , " which , diversity , diversity from my previous books , for some reason was , and it became a big sensationship .
And the result is that everywhere goes now , people treating me as if I was convicted .
I 'm true -- convicted , convicted , convicted .
They 're going to me now everyone worried and they say , " Don 't be able to do better ?
You don 't fear to continue writing all life without being able to create a book that can important to create a book that can important to someone ?
what can you do ?
It 's rassure , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember more than 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a adolescent adolescent -- I wanted to be a writer .
I went to meet the same reaction based by fear .
And people said , " Don 't themselves not to be able ?
Do you have no fear that ubility killed ?
You don 't be afrants of all life without that nothing is ever coming out and die on a cumulation of dying on a dinner , with the both full of failure ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is : " Yes .
Yes , I 'm afraid of all of things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also fear of many other things that people may not have to be .
As the algap and other frightening things .
But , how about the write I thought and wondered me , I was wondered ?
Is it rational ?
It 's a logical that anyone who has been wait to be spaving by a job that you can do .
But what is there is so particular in the creative impress to make nervous health about the health of the health of other charries , in a way that other charries not ?
And how my father , for example , he was a chemist and I don 't remember a single time in his 40 years of activity was asked if they fear to be engineer ?
Wouldn 't we -- that block of John , how do you ?
It doesn 't work like that , you know ?
Onestery , chemistrers as group don 't have certainly , in the centuries , dried the reputation of being maniaceer .
We have enough , we have enough of this reputation , and not only creative , but creative to every gender , we have this reputation of being enormous mentally .
And I 'm not going to look at the sad of the magnificent deaths of the magnificent minds that , only in the 2th century , they died young and often their young and often for them .
And even the ones that are not suicipate to be really disdisfacts from their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he died in the last interview said , " I 've killed a little more killed . " more amazing to the work of your life .
But we don 't buy the way we feel that because we 've heard these things that we 've heard these things that we 've completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way linked and that art , at the end , at the end , it will be hard to the ancient .
And the question I want to ask everyone is , you 're all of today is : you agree with this idea ?
You 're good , it 's not about this thing -- because you 're also looking at it from a centimeter , I don 't do it .
I think it 's hath .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encourage our great creative creative minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my case , in my case -- it would be very dangerous to start smoking towards that I 'm in my career .
That 's the way -- you know , I 'm pretty young , I 've got about 40 years .
I still have about four decades workers in me .
And it 's very likely that whatever I write about now , it will be judled by the world as the beautiful book .
And I 'm slaved , because we 're all more or less friends here -- is likely that my great success is my shoulder .
Oh , Green , who think !
You know this is the kind of thought that leads a person to start bees a person to start behind a person to go to the nine , and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep to continue to do this work that I love .
So , the question is , how do you do that ?
And so it seems to me , after many reflections , the way to work to write is to write is to create a protectional costruction , OK ?
I have to find a security between me security , I 'm written , and my natural anxiety on which is going to be able to get it . And as I was trying to look at the time , looking through the year , looking through the time , looking through the time , trying to find other societies to see if they could have the best ideas to have the best ideas and more sane ideas .
about how to help creative people managing to manage the inherent emotional risks of creativity .
And that research me on ancient Grece and ancient Rome .
Seguitem me because it turns out to circle and then turn .
In the ancient Grecia and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity came from the men , OK ?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit look like it , and it was going to be slightly , and unknown , for the humans , for reasons , for reasons and unknown .
The Greeks called these spirits of creativity of creativity .
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a demone that else wisdom from the distant wisdom .
The Romans were the same idea , but they called that the kind of spirit of a genius .
which is great , because the Romans didn 't really think that a genius was someone who was particularly intelligent .
They think that a genius was this kind of entities that crew was going to be literally lived in literally in the walls of the study of a artist , a little bit like the elpho Dobby , and that came out of the job of the job and model the outside of that work .
Exctional -- here is the distance of which I 'm talking about -- that courial psychological that you protects you from the results of your work .
And they all knew that it was how it worked , right ?
So the anti-s-protected artists were protected by certain things , like , you know , right ?
If your work was exceptional work was not to take all the deserve , all of that people were helped by this genius .
If your failed job , it wasn 't all your college , right ?
They all knew that was your genius to be a incapable .
And so people have conceived creativity in the West for a long time .
And then Renaised the Renaised and everything changed , and nacked this idea ; we put the human being at the center of the universe , and no longer and leave space to the degree with the devices and no longer left space to write .
This was the principle of humans , and people started to think that creativity was completely from the ished ished ished .
And for the first time in history , you start to refer this or that artist as a genius , rather than one person .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think that 's going to allow someone , a simple person to believe that you can be as a recipient as the source , the essence and the source of all of the divines , inosis a very big way to give you the psyches that are too big to give to the puzzle human psyches .
It 's how to ask someone to inguishing the sun .
It has to be completely ego completely and creates all of these intures expectations on the performance .
And I think it was this pressure to the artists in the past of the arts in the past of the 500 years .
And if that is true , and I think that 's the question is , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe back to a more understanding of the relationship between humans and mistery .
Or maybe you 're not .
Maybe we can 't squid 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there is probably people between the audience that would sold to the scientific notion of scientific notion of , you know , you know , they follow people to do spread , or behind their projects .
Probably not to convince you all of this thing .
But the question I 'd like to get is -- why not ?
Why not think about this way ?
Because it makes more sense of anything that I 've ever heard to explain the exasperformance impreve-process .
A process , as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so , all of them here -- so , everybody here -- you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you don 't understand .
And in fact , it can sometimes it seems totally paranormal .
I did this meeting with the wonderful poetesis Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but it 's been a whole poetesis for all life and told me that during his childhood in the Virginia , worked outside the rural childhood out in the rural , and he was felt , in the poem came from the landscape .
He said she was like a fragorous plus of air .
And that was rotating to her from the landscape .
The felt was going to come , because they were tremendous to the land under its feet .
She knew to have one thing to do at that point and it was of , " run as a matters . "
And so it goes to the home and was going to come home and he would not have to make a paper and a mature crap , and he would not have to make a fast piece of paper , and they would take it and slaughter and flip it on the page .
Sometimes you couldn 't be faster , so run and run and run without getting back and poem and poem and poem her through her and he would continue to rotates and he would continue to rotates through the landscape , and he would continue to rotate through the landscape , and he would continue to rotate it , and he would continue to rotate it , and she would continue to rotate it , and she would continue to rotate it , and they would go into the home and come up through the lay , and
Then there were those times -- this piece I will never forget -- there were moments where it was almost losing it , OK ?
So , she was running her home and she was looking for the card and the poem went through , and he was going to a match right in the way , and she said , he was going to go through , and she said , he was like , you know , he was like , you know , he was like , if you 're going to handing the other hand and the step .
And he was going to the poem from the tail and put it into his body and transpent on the page .
And in these cases , poem would be presented on the perfect page , but on the last word at the first .
So when I felt it -- it 's a crazy , it 's exactly equal to my process .
I 'm not a creative process -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a mule , and my way to work is , you wake up to the same hour every day and saying and get working and past and past on it .
But even I have , in my mind , I 've stripped against that thing , at sometimes .
And I think of you , many of you have done .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source , I could not honestly know .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we make it ?
As me , the best example , the best contemporary , I have is the Tom Waits , which I interview in a different years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life was the incarnation of the articity of the articulated articate , trying to manage , to manage , dominate these kind of creative impulses totally internalized .
But then I got a day , she got driving , and one day as she was driving on a autostrateway in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
She was going to fast and everything of a sent , this little framment of the high , which comes into his heads as does the inspiration , elusive , elusive , and it wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and it wild , but not how to take it .
It doesn 't have a piece of paper , it doesn 't have a matit , it doesn 't have a register .
So he begins to hear this kind of old anxiety , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to lose it , and I 'll return obsessed by this song lost .
I 'm not enough , and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to the panic , they stop .
And she was going to the whole process and made something completely new .
He just look at the sky and said , " Don 't you see that I 'm driving ? "
" You know , it 's like to write a song now ?
If you really want to be back , back at a more opports when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , I go to important someone else today .
You can see Leonard Cohen . "
And his work process changed process changed after this .
I don 't work , the job was still dark like .
But the process , and the fish that was attornight that was reef when the genius , the genius outside him that cause nothing else that was going to remained back where problems and liberated it .
but it 's very much , it 's wonderful , bizarre collaboration of Tom and this strange thing and external , and this external thing that was not Tom .
So , how I felt that story started changing a little bit the way I worked and I was saved and she was saved once .
This idea , this idea , she saved me when I was writing " Mangian , Ama , " and fall in one of those cave cave , we all work on something and we can 't start to think that , and we can 't start to think that , and we can 't start thinking that , it 's going to be the worst book .
Not just the good , just the books written .
And I started to think about gathering this project .
But then I remember Tom that was talking to the air and tried to us .
So you get up my face on the end of the huge and I went into a vacuum , and I 'm going to a vacuum .
And I said to high voices , " You see , what we 're going to be smart , you know , if this book is not going to be interacted , right ?
Because as you see , I 'm putting all I have , I don 't have any longer than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to make your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , I don 't do it , I don 't do it .
I 'll just writing the same because it 's my work .
And I want to say that it was recorded that I 've been shown today me to do my part , " Because , finally , OK -- in the end of Northern Africa -- seats ago in North Africa 's deserts , people would be able to damage hours to the close of the skyrock of hours , and the albone-hours .
And they were always magnificent , because the dancers were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every once , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists was actually transcendent .
And I know what I 'm talking about , because I know you all live , at some point , a performance .
It was like the time stopped , and the dancerine dancerine dancerve through a kind of walking , and she was not doing anything different from the usually , as the 1,000 night before , but everything else floor .
And suddenly , not appeared as a human .
But you accen from the divinside and under the fire .
And when this happens , you know what was , they called it the HHey .
They conglacks and started canting , " Allah , Allah , God . God .
That 's God , you know .
Curious note -- when Morents , the Spanish invaded the Spain , took this abitude with their and pronoundins changed in the centuries of " Allah , Allah , " in " Allah , " role , " which you can still feel in the round of the round or in the floor .
In Spanish , when a artist has done something impossible and magic , " Allah , the run , the word , Allah , " Bring , " Big , " " ununderstanding of God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But , the problem comes the day , when you wake up the dancing itself , when you wake up and discovering that are the 11 of the morning of Marteday and God is not longer .
It 's just a death with the bad ginocks , and maybe it will never be able to get to that altitude .
And maybe nobody 's going to be the name of God still while , what is it needs to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful recognations to make in a creative life .
But maybe it doesn 't have to be so angoscious if you can 't believe , intailed , intailed , inturn , the most amazing aspects of your being coming from yourself .
But you just believe that they 're going to prestand it was a prested data squisite of the squisite part of your life that you have to go to someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think about this way of changes .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly as I thought for several months in the work of the book I 'm going to publishing soon , I 'm going to public , I 'm going to do it , I 'm going to think about it , and I 'm sure , I 'm sure , very success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel elected by this is , not going to be able to be able .
You don 't fall . It 's just your work .
Continues to you to introduced , any way , you know , you know ,
If your work is dancing , you know , balls .
If the divine , you know , you know , I 'm assurd to leave some kind of wonderful , for one time through your efforts , through your efforts , then , " Of !
You do the same dance .
And " Ole ! " " to you 're the same .
I think , and I think it has to teach it .
" On you ? " You know the same , even for having love and testardaggin himself , to make you get a continuously presenting you to go and continually .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , about what it can mean and discovery new genes .
Now we 're starting a new way : we started to digitalize biology and now we started to digital code , we 're entering into a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We 've always tried to ask big questions .
" What is life ? " is something that many biologists I think have tried to understand .
We tried different approaches , reduced it to the terms .
We 're digitalizing for almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was to go from the analogical world of the computer biology .
Now we ask us : can we regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species from the smallest genome that can autorem into the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome of it to create one even smaller .
We can eliminate a hundred genes of the genes of the way I 'm here .
But when we take a look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple than our .
I think this is simple .
But when we look at all of the genes that we can eliminate , you know , is very unlikely that this can bring to a living cell a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to progrew was synthesize this chromosome to be able to modify components to bring the components to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " We can synthesize a chromosome ? "
It can be able to produce these great molecules we never have to create the great molecules that we never have to create before ?
And in case , can we make a cromosome ?
A cromosome is just a chemist of chemist material .
The speed that we can digitalize life is growing exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , rather projected , rather , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results of the exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process is require a lot of past , starting with a bioetic review before we started the first experiments .
But we found that synthesize that DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of cars in the world that produces are small DNA segments , the movement of 30 to 50 letter , and it 's a degenerative process : the longer segment is longer , the more errors .
So we had to develop a new method to assembly these fragments and correct to correct the errors .
And this was our first attempting to the digital information of the X genome genome .
It 's a little virus that kills kill .
We designed the fragments , effectively the correction of errors and get a molecule of DNA molecule of about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we 've taken this chemist of chemist material and we put it into the bacteria , and then we put it into the genetic code and produced the genetic code of viral particles .
The viral particles have been required by the cells , they 're back and destruction the E. coli .
I 've talked about recently with a members of the oil industry , which they have certainly understood this model .
They recover more than you .
We believe this is a situation where the software can actually build his own own hardware to actually build his hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things to do big things .
We wanted to build the whole chromosome of the bacteria .
I 'm more than 580 miles letters of genetic code .
So we thought I 'd build it in a seven cassettes of the viruses , so that we can change the cassets to understand what the components of a living cell .
The design is critical , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we sequence this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard was a mile for every 10 thousand low low miles .
We found , recognize it , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence of the original we would never be able to do it work .
One of the process is designing 50 longer segments that they overlap to have all the other segments of 50 letters to build subunits of the smaller segments worth together .
We try to give the only one here .
You 've probably have a bed that we put on the pursual figure .
Think of it this : we have a genetic code on four letters : A , G and T.
Three of those readers mitted code about 20 crowd , and there 's a specific order of reading for every amount of reading .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frages , thoughts .
What we did was autographs to do .
Some of them were deluses of the fact that it wasn 't .
We designed these segments to just to join them just to join .
There 's a enzymes that reputs them and put them up .
And we started assembly assembly , starting with segments from five to segments , and they 're going to segments to the sigments of 24 miles reading to the reading segments .
For every step we made these segments in abundance so we can sequence them out of sequence , we 're trying to create a very robustood -- as you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this seems like the tabellon a basket .
When we get to these very long segments very long , more than 100 miles , they 're not going to grow more directly in the E. coli .
You go to the modern limit of the modern biology .
So we 've looked at other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination of homological recombination , which in biology can use to repair the DNA can to join the segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , it can absorb three million rads .
You can see in the superior as his chromosom is destruction .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly how it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can completely sim-sim-to-handing organisms .
They can live under empty .
I 'm absolutely certain that life exist in space , and you know , to find new environments of water .
And in fact , NASA has shown that this happens .
This is a picture of molecule that we 've built using these processes , just using the evidence with the appropriate design segments .
The evidence is the automatically .
This picture was not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It 's a molecule that we can see it with a law microscope .
These are pictures that cover a time of about six seconds .
This is the publishing we did a little time ago .
It 's more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a defined structure never created by the human .
It has a molecular weight to 300 million .
If we stamp it with a 10 without spaces , it would like 142 pages , it would just like 142 pages to transmit this genetic code .
Now , how do we do that work ?
Of course , you have a virus is a virus is a game of kids .
It 's a little more complicated when they use .
It 's also simpler when it 's ekariote as our eucariote as our : you can just extract the nucleus and put another , which is basically the clonation process .
In the archaea , the archaea is instead is inside the cell , but we have recently demonstrated that we can do a transplant transplant of a cromosome , and activity .
We brought a cromosoma starting from a microbial species .
The two are how they are different men from the men .
We have added some gene more so we can decide what choose to choose for this chromosome .
The men with the enzyme , to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it into the cell cell was stupid -- and you 're appreciate our sophisticatos -- the new cromosoma has gone into the cell .
And we started to say that we couldn 't go beyond , but we 've tried to spines more .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that many species have added species have added a second or a third chromosoma , added in a thousands of new tracts to that species .
So who thinks about evolution as a gene , you know , when you 're moving a lot of the biology .
There are a sense of enzyme , " restriction that they 're diger-ism .
The chromosoma that was in the cell doesn 't have one .
The cell phone that we have put it .
It 's expressed , and recognized the other chromosom as expressed material , and we got it with only the cromosom , and we found it with only the cromosome .
it became blue because of the genes that we 've put .
And in a short time , all the characteristics of a species are gone , and it has turned into a new species , and it turned into a new species , based on the new software that we put in the cell .
All the proteins are changed , and they have changed , and when we read the genetic code what we 've transfer to what we 've transfer .
Now , this could seem alchemixics , but by high the software ftware , we can change things in the way way , in a way way of fundamental enough of fundamental .
Now , I 've already explained that you don 't talk about genesis -- but progress to three million years and a half years of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian explosion process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's quite obvious when we think about our needs .
We 're going to spend from six billion people at nine billion in the next 40 years .
Right to give you an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 ; there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicinal and gas for six billion people .
It 's going to be more hard for nine billion .
We use more coal more than five billion coal , more than 30 billion bets .
That means 100 million buses a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or whatever kind of process to reduce them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep the whole emission of CO2 from these materials that end up in the atmosphere .
And today , thank you to scientific discoveries all over the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they 're the properties for the future .
The electronic electronic has only a dozen about a dozen of components , and think how many different things have come out .
Our limits here is the limits here is the biological data and our imagination .
Now we have techniques , thank you very much as we can do the synthesization , we can create what we call the combinatory genomics .
We can make a big robots that can make a big robots that can make a million cromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes or to try to get the processes to make the processes of producing eight or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , because of the small molecular , and create more biology .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemistry production or chemistry , production of vaccine .
This is an instantly instantly of some software programmed on that we 're working for to be able to seat and design species to the computer .
Well , we don 't know necessarily know how they will be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
Now we 're going to concentrating on the fuel of quarters .
You 've seen you that they 're ethanol from grant , they had a finished experiment .
We have second-third generation , and third generation that will be used to be very higher than than eightforward , or different kinds of butan-value types of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impacts of having a big impacts without increasing the cost of food and limited the avity is going to transform CO2 in matter , so we 're working for design cells that we 're working for properly designing cells that can be remarkable to make this purpose , and think we can have the first couple of how much generation generation generation in about 18 months .
The solar light with CO2 is a metodownis a metodowntown -- but in our discoveries around the world , we have different metods .
This is an organism that we have described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2500 feet of the water depth of the water temperature .
They put in the CO2 , using molecular hydrogen molecular source source .
We 're trying to understand whether we can cancalone , you can actually be transported by tubes , convert that can be easily transmitted CO2 in fuel , to drive this process .
So , we think we could be able to increase what we could increase what the basic question , what is life is the Nice , versus what is the Nice , versus -- we have the goal modjumpism .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where you can ?
It would be a main source source of energy .
And also , we 're working on the same way , we 're working for using instantly ,
You 've seen this year with flu , we 're always back of one year and with a dollar under when it comes to find the fair .
I think that you can change building vaccines combined fight in ancient .
And that 's how the future could start seeing changing , now , the evolution of evolution , accelerating the synthetic evolution with synthetic bacteria .
We 're so on the best people .
Our purpose is to do a long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
So , I 'll show you , the most quickly possible , some fundamental work , some fundamental work , of new technology that we 've taken to the Microsoft , in the follow to a budly ahead . This is Seadray .
It 's a environment where you can interact is to local level that you can interact with a huge amount of visual data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of digital gigabyte picture with a kind of photos and continuous fast , for the panoramic fast , disponing the images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these are gonna collection or the images of data or images .
Most of the photographs , but this is a digital scan from the Bilibrary of Congress , and relost of the Congress .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixel on your screen on your screen on your screen architecture .
This is a whole book , example , not data is not pictures .
This is the Dickens of Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
And to show you that it 's about textboth and not imagery , we can do something like that , to really show that it 's a real representation of the text , not a picture .
It could be a little way artificial to read a book .
You don 't have it .
This is a more realistic example . It 's about a number of The Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful experience of reading version of a magazine or a neighborhood , which is nature for a molteam , which is nature for a molteens .
We also did something with the angle of this number of the Guardian .
We created a high-resolutionary advertising -- much more than what you use in a normal publisher -- and we put it in a normal advertising .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see them here .
Or other models , or even the techniques techniques .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminary space on the screen .
I hope that means to put the pop-up and other porks like the pop-up porks , not to be more like .
Of course , the maping is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if not say we have contributes to give up in this field .
These are all the streets in the U.S. .
So now we go to something else .
This is now actually alive from the web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Phosynth , combine two different technologies .
A is Seadragon and the other is a visual research interesting computer computer research very interesting computer computer computer , made by Noah University of Washington , with Steve Steve Steve Steve University of the U.S. of Microsoft Research . It 's a collaboration . It 's a collaboration .
And it 's from Seadray , gested by Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from a picture of the other and have this kind of experience in the other and have this kind of expertively resolution .
But the space of the images of the pictures here actually has a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization of the computer have recorded these images together , so that corresponding to the real place in the real place that the images -- all of these pictures -- all of the Grasks on the Montagne Roccious canades -- they 're taken . So , you see elements of a slide-stained slide-stained stable , and these things are all space connected to the space .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some of them are much more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original data set of Nohhimself -- and this is from a previous prototype of Phosynthrow that we 've done worked for the first time , you know , to show what I 'm the key behind this technology , the technology Phosymptosyntheless . And it 's not necessarily retelling the environments we put in the site environments we put in the site environments that we have put in the site environments that we 've got put .
We had to worry about the laws and so on .
This is a reconstruction of the Notre of Dame pictures taken from Flickr . Bastic digitar Notre . To you get to get the pictures in the sheet , other field of the campus , other campus and so on . So , we 're discovery , you know , you know , you know , you discovery .
So they 're all picked up by Flickr , and they were all connected to the space level .
And it 's possible to navigate this way simple .
You know , I 'd never have thought I would never have thought of Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying to get this kind of accohy-holizing .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different types of square saving kinds of phones to the professional phones , in the professional phones , in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try to those strange .
Many are being blocks by faces , etc .
Somewhere you find a series of photographs -- and there it 's a series of photographs -- and that 's the way .
This is a Notre Notre Dame recorrectly .
We can go from the poster to the vision physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the entire connecting data from the entire memory of how the land , from vision -- and connect all of those data together .
All those pictures become connected , more than the som of parts .
You have a model of the entire emerges .
Think about this as a prolungment of Stephen Lawler on the virtual Earth .
It 's something that growing up in complexity as people use it , and the vantages for people to use it , and the use of people to use it .
Their picture are marking with men , they 're saying ,
If someone is the idea of the idea of contracting all these saying the notion , my picture of Notre catthedral to Notre , suddenly arring all of those data , and I can use as a point of all of the data , and I can use as a space of the way , in that metaphing social experience of cross-modered social experience of cross-mobile cross-mode experience .
Of course , a consequence of this is virtual models of virtual elaborate , any part of the interesting one of the land , collected , and sellite images , but from the college memory and similar , but from the college memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software will be able to do is that there is a certain point in the next few years , all the photographs , all the photographs , they 're going to be basically connected together ?
BAA : Yeah . What he 's doing is basically discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , between images .
And it 's doing it at the basic content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of semantical information that a lot of these pictures are possible .
And as you do a research of images on the Web , you 're digits sentence and the text on page , and the text on the websentence is a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what happens if that picture connects to all your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of wealth that is really huge . It 's really huge . It 's a classic classic classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , is really incredible .
BAA : You thank you very much .
One of the major pleasures when you travel and one of the delivers research is the power to live between who has not forget the anti-traditions , between who haven 't forget the past in the wind , the wind stones in the wind , you , it in the wind of the rain .
And the wonderful sciamans are Jaguar travel even beyond the Via , or that the old Inuit is still colors of meaningly colms , or in Himalayas , the buddmies are still college the Dharma , to remember the Dharma , to remember the importance of the Dharma , and the idea that the world that we live in the assolute , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our own own own is , good or a lot of generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential trats .
We all come . We all procrease .
We 're going to be the initiation .
We have to deal with the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprising and draw --
We all have art .
What it hits is the repeculiar retremely , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they 're the Penan 's World Borneo , or the following Vooodoor the Haiti 's warrior of the Kaisut of the desert Kaisut , or a cammouth , or a cammas , or a cammas in the heart of Sahara .
He was my journey companion in the desert a month ago , or a yaks , or a yaks in the Everest , the Everest of the world .
All of these populations teachers are now other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways to think , other ways to think , other ways to think of the model of the world .
And if you think , you know , it 's a concept that you can give you hope .
Insized together , the world cultures of the world creating a spiritual and cultural life that has been cultural and cultural to the planet and is important to the planet as the biological ragela .
And you can think about this ragela cultural required as a very nosphere and you can define the total ethnosphere , the total of all the concepts , dreams , inspiration , intuitions , intuitions , inspiration , intuitions , inspiration , intuitions , inspiration ,
The etnosphere is the patrimony of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we 're and what we can be as a species .
And because the biosphere was a very consumed by the way , we had happened to the etnosphere and purfortunately much faster .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species was on the horrim of simply because it 's false , because it 's false is false -- in the most apocalypppelp -- in the most optimistic of biological diversity -- and you don 't even even even even even fuses in the most optimistic -- that of the diversity of cultural diversity .
The index of all of that is , of course , the loss of language .
When you were born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the package of human spirit .
It 's the middle of which animal goes into the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a water water water water water , a spiritual chance .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we 're here sitting in Monterey , at least half , it 's not longer surrounded in the ears of children .
They don 't come to teach children , which means , unless you know , unless you won something , which is already dead .
What is you more sad than being the silence , of being the last to talk to a language , the last talk to a language , not to transmit the wisdom of traveling , or ancient promise the promise of children ?
This is a further of someone in the world every two weeks : every two weeks , every two weeks , a child 's dead and bring with the so-of the last syllables of an ancillables .
And I know someone who is going to say , " Isn 't that ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we talk about all of the same language ? " Well , then we talk to all yorba .
We talk about kogs .
You 'll find a transactation of what it means not to talk about their language .
I 'd like to do a journey through the ethnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosfer to give you a little bit of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of existing really , " different ways of existing .
So , let 's take for example of this Barasana Barasana , in Amazon settle , the people of the anaconda , which crees to come from the latte of the snake river 's walking .
It 's a popular that is not able to distinguish the blue color from the green , because the cell is identified in the time of the forest , which depends the popular popular .
They have a strange language and a gle ruled rule , " exogamia " language : " You have to marriage a different language .
And this is all of roots in the past past , though the particularity is that in these families that they talk about six or seven languages , because they 're talking about six , marriage .
They 're limited to listen to listen to it .
We take one of tribe more interesting to the way I lived , the Waoran Ecuador , the Waoran Easter , a popular that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have tried to a factor .
They did taken off the photographs that they had a few tuned that they had a few publishing , forest this population had never seen anything that 's popular .
They have gathered the picture of the land , they turned them into the research of a shape and , not found nothing , they have concluded that it was the direct of the diavel , and they killed the five missionaries with the launches .
But the Waorani shouldn 't just kill the straneors .
They kill them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We 've been honey generations and found two of natural morning and we found two natural death , and when we innered to know , they admitted that one of them , aging that dead , and then they kill it the same .
The crawling could recognize the 40 steps and recognize the species .
In the early ' 80s , I was assigned a very interesting task when I was a very interesting when I was asked when I was asked if I wanted to go to Haiti Haiti to intruly Haiti me if I wanted to go to Haiti and Ton Macouter , and impossessing me of the Ton Macoutes , and impossessing me of the willing we used to do the zombigger zombies .
To give a sense of miraculous miraculous , I should understand the Vodoun culture and Vodoo is not magic .
It 's pretty much of a complex metaphysical view of the world .
Very interesting .
If I ask you to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianism , Islam , Budddism , Ebraism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has no religious light-Saharan Africa has no religious foundly . And the Vodoo is not that the distillate of these religious concept in slavery .
What makes the voodoor is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , you know , the lifetime .
The spirits can be invited by the Great Acqua , they respond to the dance of the dance and replaced temporary soul to the soul of the way , the goal of the way that you can do it becomes the god .
And that 's why they love voooists like , " You know white , you know , you know , God .
We say in the temple and forget God . "
And the time you 're possessing , is the spirit that you 're driving you , how can you do the evil ?
So you 're looking at these incredible events : following voodoor in the state of trance that touch impunfuel types of infuse and a demonstration , rather stronger to the body 's body 's cataled into a state of extreme , when it 's cataled in a state of extreme .
In all the popular Nevada , I lived the most amazing of the Sierra Nevada Nevada de Sierra Marta Marta , in Colombia section .
Exide of the ancient civilization that once lies lived on the characters of Colombic , and they were require on the waiting of the vulcanic massive planure of the vulcanic , that you 're on the characber .
In a blood continent , this popular continent , this popular never been conquered by the spagnology .
And now , they 're governed by a clernal , but their formation is decisionally extraordinary .
The following is taken away from the family to three or four years , and live in a good world and hundred and living in a good world and shadow in the bottom of the glacier for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , I 'm going to reproduce the nine months of gestation that spent into the user of the mother 's usual mother , now are metaphically in the user of the GGreat Mother .
And so , for all of the time , they 're acculturated to their society , values that they predict their predict and only their predict to their predict , they keep the cosmic balance .
At the term of this incredible initiation , they 're sudden , and they 're sudden , and for the first time in their life , at the age of the first one , when the sun behind the first one , when the sun behind valley , when the sun beautiful beautiful valleed , everything that they learned in theory , they 're confirmed with all of the splendor , and says ,
" Vished ? I 'm told you .
It 's amazing . It 's now to protect it .
They 're called the bigger brothers and say that we , brothers , we 're the college of the destruction of the world .
This is intuition is extremely important .
When we think about the ingene and the environment , we 're the Resau and the old story of the noble self-history of the noble self-the-invoice , or perhaps , we say that these populations are closer to the Earth of us .
The Ingeniuses are not feeling in the indebull .
There is no space for these things in the malaria of the Astststop in the gelids of the Tibet , but thanks to the time and ruses , they created a mistic of the Earth 's based on the concept of being consciously nearly nearly , but on a balures that the Earth can only live only because it 's infection , but the concept that the Earth can only live only because it 's consciousness .
What does it mean ?
That 's a boy of the Ande who grows that the Ande who grows that the mountain is a Apu that will be drive his destiny will be a human destiny , and it 's going to have a different relationship with the mountain or that place , and it 's going to be a different relationship with the Montana , and it 's a massive mountains of Montana .
which is the dead of a mineral or a mineral city is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor is the metaphor is the report of the individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Britannica Britannica credit that the forests served to be cut .
And that made me a different human being from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the Hukuk dimora of Hukuk and the paradise of paradise and the dog downathering of the world , spirits that live on the north of the world , spirits , explaining that they live in the first beginning , and the paradise .
If you start to look at these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of their sensitive discoveries . We take this plants . We take this plants .
I 've taken this picture to open in the north-doctors .
Maybe some of you have heard of the ayahumpahumption of the sciamanic repertoilet 's the sciamanic repertoilet 's be .
What makes the playahuash is not the physca potential of the substance , but its elements . It 's taken by two elements .
It 's a hall , this lethrow that contains a series of beautiful , harmful , harmine and harband moline , slightly huge hologies .
You can take the only plant , you have a blue smoke that high a little bit of consciousness , but it 's miscale of the family of the Psychotria .
This plant contains triplowing triptamine , very similar to serotonin the methoyltryltryltrylthoxyptamine .
If you ever see the Yanomami , you know , they make a different set of species , anchy , they make a different set of species , anchy methoxylthoxylthoxylthoyltrylthoxylthoxylthoxypacy .
And then the nose is to the nose is a bit of how to be disappeared by a fire of boats and landing up a wake of electricity . You know , you know , you know , it 's not creates a distortion of reality .
I had often often , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who took the Psychedelic was psychedelic , in the ' 30 in Mexico .
I mean , my thesis , you can 't be to be truly to be triptamines , because if you can 't tell anybody to be hallucinated . And they can 't tell anybody to be hallucinated . And they can 't be honey because they 're money from a physical enzenzyme , they 're inosis , because they 're in the intestine , detes , they can 't be hallucinly in the intestine ,
You can just absually , if they just hundred summer , which denaturate the MAO .
Now , the beautiful : the beautiful : carboline that are inhibitors of MAO , the same kind of need to potential to the triployment . The spontaneous question : in a spontaneous surprising , in a 80,000 species of plants , how do they find two morphology dead , but if you combine , they 're not , but if you combine , it 's supplies to the high the parts ?
We use the great euphemism of evidence and error , which can reveal .
But if we ask the Indian , they 'll tell us , " The plants are talking about it . "
What does it mean ?
This tribe , the Cofan , the Cofan , and it has 17 varieties of the gathered , and that our eyes would be revenues in the forest species .
If we ask them how they do they do their tasonomous telling us , " I thought of plants , you know , you don 't know ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take the 17 varieties in a night , and each night will be a dog with a different .
With this doesn 't do that Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that content stams .
Now , you know , the problem is that even those of us who have heart at the people who have heart in the ingenes are found them , but in a reduced to our real world , and pass .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it 's not reminded for its wars or its technologies , but rather as the era that we were stopped and abbracing actively , and we have abbracing the mass destruction of the planet . Now , the problem is not the change .
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new chance of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians have no stopped to be Sioux when they put out of the arrow and flies as Americans don 't stop being Americans when they put out of Americans don 't stop being Americans when they 're stopped by horse and heat .
It 's not the change or technology that threatening integrity of the integrity . It 's the power .
The flight of the domination .
And if you look at the world , you find that these are not cultures are not cultures of disappeared to disappeared .
They 're living creatures and dynamics spints out of the identifiable forces that go beyond their adaptation .
And the disboscaring of the Penan ,
a popular nomake of Sarax-Asian popular popular , a popular popular who lived free into the forest to a generation ago , and now reduced to the service and prostitution on the redefer , where you can see the rive river , where you can see the windquined by the Merial Cinese Meries , where the naves free flightforest ,
taking the stage of the stands with the forest standing .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the diseases that have come to the discovery of the golden .
If we move on the Tibet mountains of the Tibet , where I 'm doing many research , you 'll see the hard of political domination .
As you know the genocide , physical extinction of a popular , is convicted to universal level , but ethnocide , ethnocise , the destruction of a popular lives , not only is convicted , but it 's further the celebrated , because it 's part of the strategy development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet of the Tibet until you 're part of the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in Western Cina through Tibet South East , coming to Lhasa with a young connecting young connecting , but only came to Lhasa I realized what 's behind the statistics of which we feel about .
6,000 sacred monuments to dust .
1.2 million people killed by the military military during the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical to Panchen Lama .
which means that it was killed to the time of the Chinese invasion .
His further furniture with Sua Santity during the diaspora that led the population in Nepal .
His mother was impresoned and his colpurposed was to be rich .
It was born of hidden in the age of two years , hidden under his gonna because it could not live without him .
The sister , which has done the same , was put in reeducation .
One day has been windly fashion a Mao and , for this transgression , was put in the forced works for seven years .
The Tibet can be insuit can be insuit , but the reinside of the people is to hold .
And then , it 's all reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the world monoh of the monotonia or we want to across the policem of diversity ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he said that his biggest was that , in our way to go to this love the load of the world , we will not just see the whole gamma gamma of human imagination , but one day we 'll think , but one day we 'll be able to be able to go from a sleeping , but one day we 'll see from a sleeping , even that we were able .
And it 's the humiliating our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The Neolitical Revolution , who gave us the agriculture , which made us sucked us to the cult of the seed cult of the sler , by the sler 's sler , creating the gerarchy of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industrialized is 300 years .
That 's a story not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we 'll have to deal in the millennia to come .
When these miric cultures of the world is asked what it means to be human , they say , " His , they say with 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all risky the chance of being what we 're : we 're aware , that we 're all aware , that has to make all the people and all the garden yarden .
I took this picture on the northern end of the island of Baffin , when I went to the hunt of the Baffin the Inuit , and this man Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , he told his grandfather .
The canady was not always managed to the Inuit and in the ' 50s to stabilights , we 've rinclosed them , we 've rinclosed them .
The grandfather was refused to go there .
The family , I temise her life , took them all the arms , and all of his atticks .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't themselves freak , the cold .
The sledge of sledges were made of the fish .
The grandfather , he didn 't intimise from the Artica or or the library of the libraries .
It 's gattacked out , they cut them into focused the skin skin and defected in your hand defected into your hand . When the flip of the focused , they worked by creating a bama .
It 's got spring on the door of this craft hits and when it became solid , it killed a dog .
It took a dog and created a bridaughter , with the hills made a slethrown , he imbrought another dog on the banker , and it 's disappeared on the banker , hit .
We want to talk about cavarsely with nothing ?
In the Califoraded 1999 government government reached the canady reached the total control of a larger area of California and Texas , and Texas mitted together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's an independent territory . They control all the minerary resources .
One splendido is , you know , how a nation-state can reconcilim with his people .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious at least at the people who had been in these remote zones of the planet , remote that they 're not at remote .
For someone is home .
They represents of the human imagination that they 're going to get on the dawn of the days . And for us all , the dreams of these children , as the dreams of our children , becomes part of the hope .
And finally , we have to do National Geographic we 're convinced that politicians will never get nothing .
We believe that polemies --
[ Applauses ] they 're not persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the world stories . Every though our website . Every our website . Every our website .
156 countries transmit our television .
Our retents are laughing from millions .
Our work is travel to bring our public to bring our audience in places of wonders , cultural , where they 're going to cut out how they have seen , they 're hoping , hubraced by the central revelation of the world , the deserve world of exists to exists in diversity , and multicultural world 's lifestyle . And we have to find a lifestyle .
where the wisdom of all the people can contributing to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote about this book that I hope is more than you 've heard and try to evidence some connections , in the case , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
I want to start with what I call " the " official dogma .
The official dogma official : what ?
The official dogma 's official dogen dogma dogma : " If we want to massive to male the official dogen : " If we want to massive " citizens . "
The reason is , from a hand in the fact that freedom is in itself a value , is precious , useful , essential for human beings .
And then , in the other is that if we 're free , each of us can act for it to do everything that massive simizes our well-being , without any decided in our well-us .
The way to massive freedom is massive freedom .
More choices people have , the more , and more is their liberty , more is their liberty , more is their well-being .
This , I think , is so deeply radicated in society that nobody would have to put it into doubt .
And it 's also deeply radicated in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has been possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly great .
I 'm a simple note about the conditivegetable .
And in my supermarket , there are 175 conditivements , without contention 10 varieties of oil and 12 acetes and the 12 acetes , and the 12 balsamic aceps that nobody of 175 , already is your degree .
Here 's what supermarket is supermarket .
And then you go to the electronic store to buy a stereo : CD , lector , radio , the CD , radio , radio , the amplificer .
And in this single electronics store , there is a great audio number of components .
We can do six million different combination by different combination using the components that there are only one store .
You have to admit is a lot of choice .
Other travels : the world of communications .
Once I was a child , you could get all of the phone services , you could get all of the phone , to the evil that were provided by mom Bell .
It was doing the phone , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , between the other , was that the telephone never breeding .
These days are gone .
Now , we have a variety of telephones , especially among the cell phones .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is the middle , MP3 , cut hair , cut of nose , and the high crowd .
If you don 't see it yet in the case you haven 't seen it in the home , you 're going to be able to be .
And what happens is that people enters are in the stops and does this question . And you know , you know , " answer ? " The answer is " No . "
You can 't buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the purches , you verging the same choices of choices .
Assistening health . It doesn 't happen in the United States , you know , you know , you know , you know what you have to do .
Instead , I go from the doctor , and doctor says , " Okay , we could do A , or B " As these risks and these risks " Big and these risks " Big and these risks . What do you do ? "
You say , " Dotttor , what I should do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these risks and these risks and these risks and B has these risks and these risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebad , you know , " Dottore if she was me , what would you do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not . "
The result of the result of the malth of the malth , expression that makes it seemed to look like a great thing .
But in fact , it 's not that a move the weight and responsibility of taking someone who knows about it , to someone else knows , to someone else knows -- and almost of course , it 's not in the ideal condition to take the ideal decisions .
There 's a huge marketing of pharmaceutical products , direct to people like me and you , that if you think about it , it doesn 't have any sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do they publishing them ?
The answer is that they want to do it . We call the doctor for ask them to change the recipe .
And so , so the fundamental as is our identity is a question of choice , how you see in this vignize , " We don 't want to force the children . They will disruption their sex at the right time . " We don 't herve identity . We have to make it .
And we can reinvent how many times you do it .
which means that every morning , at the time , you have to decide that kind of person want to be .
I 'm going to spect family and marriage , a time , common time , communal perspective , almost of anyone , was that it was that they married the most possible possible , and she began to make the most soon as possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when you 're not when , and not what to do .
And it 's really to play .
I teach very intelligent students , and I do 20 percent of work , I 'm going to be a time .
And it 's not because they 're less , they 're not because they 're less diligent .
but why are they impent , you know , I 'm asking , " Would I be married or not ? I should be doing it right now ? "
" Would I be marrier ? I have to think about before to the kids or career ? "
I 'm interrogative .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even if this implay , it 's not to get the tasks and not to get a good vote to my examples .
And they have to really do it . They really important .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl underway , because technology allows us to work every day , every minute , every day , every corner of the planet , except that the Hotel Randolpholph .
In the parenty-, there is a corangles , and I won 't tell you that , where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work ? It 's continually decide , if we have to do , continually decided to work or not .
We can go to see our child playing , with the cell phone in a cell , Blackberry in the other , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the notebook , and the notebook , typically , on the knees .
And even though they 're all spent , every minute that we see our child , we 're also asking the game , we 're also asking , " Do you say , " Do you say , " Do you say , " Do you say , " Do you say , " Do you know , we 're also asking , " I 'm also asking the whole baby , we 're
" I have to say what ? I have to get this email ? "
And even when the answer is " no , all this makes the experience of your child 's beautiful child 's child 's been in other conditions .
So , whatever we look at , little things , big things and large materials and further , life is a question of choices .
The world was this : Oversial , there were some chance , but it was not a question of choice .
The world of today looks like this : The dilemma is : Is it a good thing , or negative ?
The answer is Should you be .
We all the sorts of the slightly , so I 'm going to talk about the negative .
All this choice two negative effects of the people .
The first one is , paradoxically is that produces instead of liberation .
With so many options of which choose , it becomes very difficult .
I 'm going to give you an example : a study conduct to the volunteer plans .
A colleaged to have access to Vancils data , the gigantic funding funding funding , with about a million clients in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are being offered in more , the percentage of adesion , two percent .
With 50 funds of offerts , there 's 10 percent in less adesions than when they 're available . Why ?
Because with 50 funds of shapes , is sick , it 's hard to decide , and choice is remaining the choice .
And then questions , and again , questions , questions , and , of course , and tomorrow , and tomorrow .
You know , it doesn 't only mean that these workers are going to be eats for canoes because they 're not going to say that the decision is so hatred is so hath that they lose the funds of the complementary jobs of the complementary jobs .
They 're not participating , they 're losing to five dollars for the year from the work dator of work , which would be well ,
So , the paralysis a consequence of choices .
And I think it makes the world .
" And finally , " ketchup , " ketchup , " ketchup , "
You want to take the right decision , if it 's for eternity , right ?
You don 't want to choose bottom , and you don 't want to be the wrong .
So this is the first effect . The second is that even if we can avoid paralysis , and make a choice , we 're fewer , we 're fewer to the result of how we would be with less options .
And this for different reasons .
One of these is that with many conditions , which is you buy , and it 's not perfect , it 's very easy , it 's very easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that the alternative imagined . It 's the alternative imagined . It 's the alternative to the decision , and the required by decision ,
even when it was a good decision .
More , you know , you 're easier , the easier is easy of any detailable than any choice .
And there is what economists call constant constant opportunities .
Dan Gilbert asked very well as a value that we depends on what we depends on what we depends on what we 're .
And the rest , when there are many options of options , is easy to represent the characters of the option of the option of the option that is choice .
Here 's an example . I school with all of them who are not New York .
But that 's what you probably think .
There 's this couple of Hamptons .
A place of lurther .
It 's bears . Ottim . It 's all for them .
Nothing . But what he thinks is , it 's not hard .
" All my neighbors are in Manhattan is away . "
" I could do it with a lot of front of home . "
And it spend two weeks , from the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the chance of parking , where it 's going to .
The constituens decreases the satisfaction for what we have , even when choice was excellent .
And the more is the options that we have to consider , the more the characteristics will be returned against as constitutes .
Here 's another example .
This is a view of things .
It 's about living the moment , and maybe living slowly .
But the most important point is that any thing you choose , you choose , you choose to do .
The things that we don 't choose to have a lot of attractive attractive what we do .
Third point : : spiral growing expectations .
I tried it on my skin my skin jeans .
I 'm always push .
And once the jeans were only one kind of , buy them and they would walk up from the bestivestivestivestival , they were moved , and they were working a lot of times , they started to go well .
So , I went to buy a new when the old ones were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The commit told me , " You want the slim fit , hit hit ? "
And he wants to the cernightons ? " Stonewashed , " or " across " ?
" You want to have the strapped ? "
" You have them to want to the blades or high . Buills -- " was elency to elency .
I was saying , and after a while I was able to say , " I want the guy , I 'd like the only like , " Helse , " he was the only like , " Hunctually , I tried to all the maledets jeans , and then came out of the best jeans , and I went out of the best jeans that ever had .
It was the massive . And I got the whole choice , I had the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worst is that with all of the choice , the mixture was very high , jeans , jeans should be perfect .
I started expectations , I waiting anything . I didn 't expect anything except when it was only there was a kind of , but when it saw 100 different , it had to be perfect .
What I had was buy , but not perfect .
After I had compared that choice with what I was trying to do with what I was trying to do .
The addition of options in the life of people not make that increasing expectations that these have respect to the excellence of the options .
And this will produce less satisfaction , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing if it 's connected .
Because if they knew , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth is more like this .
" You know , " she was better when you were worse , " The reason you 'd better when you were worse is that when you were worse was that when you were worse was possible to meet .
And the world that we live in -- opulents , industrialized , industrialized citizens with the perfeet -- the massive we can hope is that the things are at the height of aspectativity .
You never have surprised , because your expectations , you know , my aspectations , you know , they 're ingigantic .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse , " You waiting " Say , " Yes , you want . "
I mean -- little autobiographic moment -- which I 'm really married and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't have to do better , I didn 't have to do better ,
But you don 't always want to be a good thing .
And then , a consequence of the buy jeans , when there 's only that you 're just that when you don 't satives , you know , and ask , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " " And the answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do you do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a factor , and you 're asking you who is responsible , and ask you who is responsible , is the responsible , you 're you .
You could have done better .
With hundreds of varieties of varieties , there are no excuse .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is worth , they 're going to feel that they 're going to be able , and give the colate to themselves .
In the last few years , the depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- of this wave is that the depression of the depression of is just that people have deludent experiences because the standards are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that colcolors is their colcolors .
So the final result is that we 're better , and at general , we 're better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than haven 't at all but it 's not at all . But it doesn 't really get a lot of choice is better than they 're a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic value . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we have super-based , we have superted by a piece of the level , the choices of our life .
Now , from the politician point of view -- I 'm almost finished -- from politician point .
What you can do all this choice in industrial society is the material .
There are many places in the world , and you know it was a lot of people , where the problem is that they have too much .
The problem is that they have too little too .
So the face I 'm talking about is a mal-exclusive of modern , reminded society .
And what does have to do is this : Steve Levitt talked about yesterday about how those constomists and discoverage seats for both bomber . It 's a spreef of money .
I mean these choices , complicated and dispendious , it 's not that they 're just inured .
I 'm going to say of the eteries .
They make it worse .
If a little bit of what we in our societies allows choice was reversed in where people have too few possibilities , it would not only be a few possibilities , it would not only be better , but also our own .
This is what economists call a paretian improvement .
A redistribution of the income is good to everyone -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice , excess , that 's going back us .
And then , to conclude , " You can become everything that you want , "
You , people are about culture , you think , " What does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get anything in a glass . "
" A imagination , a limited view of the world --
and I 'm doing it , I interpreted it , at the beginning .
But then , think about it , instead , I realized that fish the weight of the knows .
Because the reality of the fact is that if you have to sent the bocks , so that it is it possible , " You don 't get freedom . You get the paralysis . It 's a paralysis .
If you break the bocks , so that everything you can decrease .
You get the paralysis , and you reduced the paralysis .
They all need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too , and maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some symbolic symbolic sphere is a recipe for flection and , for roin the roin .
Thank you very much .
