The year I showed these diasions to show you that the bluial clacial year , which is a size of years of years , which is the 48 million years of the 48 percent of the United States , is to 40 percent of the United States .
And that 's this sound , the gravity of the problem because I won 't show it it to the ice of the ice .
The calculartics is , in a sense , in a sense of the climate system of the climate system .
It 's a swind and you get out of the estate .
The next next to be a rapilated carcars , the last 25 years .
The long-hundreds are in the crap .
You see , you see it out to the blue .
That 's the ice ice ice ice ice ice , which you can get it out of the forest .
You can see that the cosix tarm , of five years , and it 's five years or more , is like the sanguy , and that I realize from the body .
In 25 years was going to be so , so that I was so ,
This is a problem because the rescale to the whole whole whole whole whole whole world of the ocean , where there are huge to the ocean , where there are huge of carbon , and they 're going to dog , and they 're transformed to put it in the microbes .
It 's a totally totally the mosquency , that quickly remosquare , that quickly , that you can 't get around this point .
In some laghi , the pound , the metaphi metan , it 's already to the water .
The professoral Katey Walter of the University of Alaska , you 've got a touldn 't a swinverage .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You 're going to do it . The question is if we will be able to us .
A reason is that this scale to the Groency Groency .
This is a figure out .
And he had never reached them .
This is the figure Kangerluslier , in the Groency of Groency .
If you want to know how to do the longer of the mb of the souldn 't know how to do it .
These are audience , and we 're aught to be rapidly .
Ather of the planet : Antartarttarttarttararttararartttartttarttarttartttarttartttartttarttararttttarartttttararttttttararttttttttararttttttttarttttarararttttt
The country wasked the scientists have direct that the long-slide , and that Antartarttarttarttarttartttars , which is particularly , is particularly , is particularly in the middddddly , and it 's a hertainly , the bills of the bills .
It 's a six meters of the active level of the active of the active .
SHimalaya , the third , the third of the most most most more than they see new laghi , who were a new years ago .
Or 40 percent of the world 's mountain water will be a popull of the water .
Sull Antice : this whole water of the water of the water water .
The braned was aumented .
But when it 's the same , the same access of water .
In California the news on the Sighborn .
The gets of the gets are in .
The presions , like you have a longer , I 'm graves .
The growth of the world 's taken a night of the incency .
The environmental environmental , and we 're going to get out from the bad and without out .
AM : West the last 30 years , you know , 75 years to 75 .
This is a handing of all the instead .
If you look at the context of the context , if you can see the consequences .
In the last five million years we 've got 70 million tonce of CO2 24 hours -- 25 million ton-million tond .
You know , the area of the area of the area of the Pacifician , and to the object , and you 're going to go to the parts of the Dradads , where there 's a huge of the oceans .
Most of the makes the global removing , together , and the deforest , which is 20 percent , is the most of the middddle .
The oil is a problem , and the carbon is personal .
The United States are one of two countries , with the most emissions , together .
And you provide to build many other other .
But we 're going to be a change or or direction .
These are the designers in the last years and some projects in the last years and some of the verage .
And every way , there 's a politics in our country in our country .
The industries and the oil and the oil of the cooil , in the last year for the last year to promoving cost the cover of wood , which is a simmen .
I remember to remember me to me something --
I 'm Nath , in the Tennesis , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion .
You 've seen the notise .
This is the second longer of the scories of America .
It 's happened around Natal .
The blicity of a industries of a coooods of carbon .
Video : You 're going to do the carbon is a cool kind of a crazy and happy .
It 's a lot of here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
It 's always the carbon is more .
It 's a good predict , and the workers and work it 's workers .
At Gore : Da is a lot of the carbon West Virgn Virginia .
The most society society is Massey City . This is Massey . This is his friend .
Video : Don Blankennency : Al Gore , Al Gore , Norts , Harry Reid -- not not going to talk about what are .
At Gore : So the Alleance for the Clim of Clim Clim ,
This is a part of it , one one .
Video : Actor : All COLergy see the climate change as a climate change in our business .
So this is to be able to be a great great quantity of money in a swind , a blict of the truth and conflict the cover of the cover of the coaly-cover .
In fact , the carbon is not sport .
We think it 's a hours -- it 's also a good good .
So that 's not precient the change of the climate change .
Let 's asking us .
Video : Actor : Carbone : you 've heard to talk about .
So , I 'm going to get a given of a strong of the cover of how to get the cover of the cover .
It 's a very much . The machine is a little bit , but this is the summmmust the cover of the coast .
We 're going to cover the makes the makes the makes global remachine , but the night technology of the cocover technology of the coast , you see it all changes .
You can go : this is the odiern technology of the cover of the cover .
At Gore : At the end of the way , the connected connected to the question of the ctual citive , and that 's national national national .
Video : Comvvice : The economy , the economy , the economy , the crisis , the crisis .
The challenge to all the college : our dipendence from the copy , as the cover , as the oil and the importance .
Now , I 'll go , there 's a new solution for use for used to use .
Rewine America : 100 percent of energy , in the midle .
A pian to put the America to the work in the work , and to make more more to stop the global rescale to the global remakes global global .
It 's actually , a solution that bad solution .
Hewine America . Scover .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's the : It 's going to be energy to the America .
One of the most most fast to the end of the end of the end of the midddence that we 're going to do our planet .
It 's here here 's the future is here . I 'm here , a new energy .
It 's going to do two : Nugal investment to work ,
Coment : Rewiting America . It 's time .
At Gore : A ttraw , you want to go to the handed , you want to go to the solar .
If you want to go , and you go together . "
We need to go to the way , you know .
Thank you very much .
They wait to TED TED fective at TED LLHC .
And you know , you know , you know , you know , how the machine works .
So , I 'm a lot of the other that other time . And there were no , LHC is the most experiment , the most experiment -- 27 , 27 , 27 , 27 , 27 ,
His compart is to recognize the conditions that were less than a million the beginning of the first first of the universe -- to 600 million times .
That 's just just just what it is simply .
This is the machine Gineventually .
We 're photography Bang Bang Bang Bang .
This is what work . It 's called ATLLALS -- is a 44 meters and has a 44 feet .
This is an image of ATLALS in built , you can build the proportions .
The 10 settember the scored scale , we 've got the first time for the first time .
And this picture was writed by ALS .
It 's used to imimming , you 're in the wind of control .
It 's a picture of the first phasm that had all the first of the LHC , and then , in the LLLHC , and to a lot of the LLHC , and we 're in the LLC , and we 're wining the winside of the wind .
In other words , when we see that the image of 10 settember , we understand that the machine , that 's a great vitting great vvvitted .
I don 't know if it was to do this , and I 'm going to do this , when somebody 's going to Google and vide that the beginning was this page .
It means we had a cultural cultural cultural cultural .
It 's a week after , there was a problem with the machine , you 've got to these kids here -- these fiddried .
These figured 13,000 cars when the machine works .
Now , the technical , the technical challenge and tell them , " It 's not . They 're not true . "
And it 's a lot of that when they are very much to become the cosiddly , they 're going to condition .
So , at 271 , at a temperature , at a temperature of the space of the space , these things can bring that the corrent that corrent .
In one of the only one of the most nail in the LLHC , there was a difaburther of faburation .
So the field you can read a little bit , and 13,000 feet , and 13,000 feet .
This was the results .
Now , this is still more impression-size , if you think these magnetic netic , and that are saying , and that are saying about 30 centimeters , and they 're in about 30 centimeters .
They 're slightly about 50 magnetic .
We had to take them them them , what we did .
We 've got and hured and and hured and and hured .
They 're going to go all of their place .
It 's the end of the wood of the LLHC will be new integro .
We 're going to get , and we 're going to get the right right now , and then we get the right , and then we get our days , and then we 're going to find the universe that are the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these crazing , these crazing the value of the value of the value of science and the hand-connected . It was easy .
I think the fact that it 's so hard to go , the same way to go , I think it 's the same thing like LLHC .
I would like to end with the words of a scientist Inglese , Humphrey Davy , which is , in the draw , and in the experiments of his hands , his hands , his hours , his hours , and he said , " Humpy , " to be a lot of the ideas of the ideas , " it 's a lot of our ideas , and it 's not to do .
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to think when you get to to do you , and you 're going to go .
And you understand how to reach them like race and and stop them , and then you get them , and then then you learn to think , and they 're going to think , and they 're going to recognization .
The reasoning is project is proach to the way we understand the world around us .
So , from the information from the inspired of our interaction with our own , and I started to my connects , and my collaborator , and my collaborator Kalanithanithi , I started asked me , " And if we 're going to have a computer , " and if we 're going to have a computer , and we can make a little bit the mountil the mountil of the downers , a little bit of a physical information , and we can make a little bit of the mounds , and we can make a little , with a little , with a , and we can do with a , and we can 't start , and we can 't start a little more more more more more more more more more more more more more more than the makes the makes the
And how to do our piacimage ?
The question was so interesting that decided to explore the answer , built the answer , built the Siftable .
In fact , a Siftable , a Siften computer as a bad .
In fact , a Siftable , a Siften computer as a bad .
He can see it with the hand , can see the movement , you know , and they 're movement and and a rawireless and a rawireless .
But it 's objects , I 'm objects , like the morning , you can just just just just just just just just further .
The Siftable of a new ecouple of a new ecooly system to manipulal information .
And as they become more , and the most of the movement , and the other movement , and it 's more , and it 's more , and the most of the movement , and the other movement , as we can see new new movement , and different different different different things .
So I 'm going to do with a simple example .
This is configurban is configurbed to show you the video : if you include a direction , the video , if you wind , if you go back to the other .
These ritical interactive are connected to other other .
If you 're doing that , you 're interested in what it is their around around .
If they 're circumit , and they can get a little bit .
If they 're circumit , and they can get a little bit .
They also have the movement and including and including .
We 've rescue that one of the interaction of the interaction was the power of the power , and the data data , " example of the data data , " example , " example of a couple .
So , we have three Siftable configurbed as a seced , and I can use them to get them to the color , where you can go to the color , where they 're going to go .
And I can use them to the color in the central concentral , where you can put it .
If we 're too , we can see a little bit .
There are also the chance of apappeared , as the lingue , the mathematics and yet , and ygical people can try and logical things , and you can see the results , and you see the results of the results , and you 're also to see the results .
Now , I 'm going to --
This is a sequence of Fibonacross us that I do with a matheme of equations .
Here we have a game of words that is going to do a Scareer and Bogle and Boggle .
Siften , at every remember a remember , the land of every Siften , Pratically , every remember , and you 're going to get a hour , and while you 're going to compories of the words on a couple of a dionary .
Then , after 30 seconds , and you get a new new lective , and you have a new new ability to try and new possibility to try to try and new possibility to try to try and a new .
Thank you .
Here 's the children were in glass to Media Lab , I did that they 've been able to try and I was a video .
They are a very much .
And one of the things that are interested in this gence of this genist of the things .
You just say , " What 's just to say , " and they 're going to do .
Here 's the other people who are trying to do it .
This is our head head , there 's a little bit , there .
It was just to be able to hold them .
They only morning , for him , for him .
Now , this is a application of a carton .
We wanted to build a tools for the linguguys of the linguy is Felix .
It 's going to give new personongs in the scenes , and we 're going to the Siften ,
It 's going to give new personongs in the scenes , and we 're going to the Siften ,
Here 's what 's doing .
Video : The solar is surprise .
David Merrist : Now , it 's a true in the scens .
Video : The attack arm .
By work ! Yeah ! You 're ! You know !
So school , I 'm the Siftable and put the neiften can get the personages .
Video : Yau !
-- I 'm going to do the story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It 's a story with a story , and you can decide , and he decided it , and he decided it .
DM : It 's a story with a story , and you can decide , and he decided it , and he decided it .
Video : Video : Wather .
DM : The last example I 've got the time to show you is one , realized it 's a crather , to war and wild to be music .
It 's one instrument , recently , to wrow and explain to the music .
The Siften , they 're going to summmen , and the battery .
And you can get four different different different variations , and you can choose what use .
You can go to the inserious sequence from your sequence .
And it 's just a simply simply doing a squence , and a sequence . "
These are actually that you can find out from the visual control , and the true and the true .
You know , you know , and then including a particular and then including it .
And then there are the general general time , and I want to do it to the whole sequence .
We see how we go .
Video : So we 're going to put a base in two Siftable , " and we 're going to go to a series , we go to a series , we can make it .
Now , I 'm a line of the basis .
Video : Now , now now now now ,
Video : And now now , and I 'm going to the battery , so I can control the effect of the effect .
Video : Poso : Posone : Posone , the whole sequence , and we 're going to the other .
Video : And I 'll give the moving truth the moving true to the phone .
Video : Poso : Posake the sequence to the sequence .
So I won 't have the first , but I can get the first , I can get more more .
And now , I can see the whole sequence , I can see the whole sequence of the right right right now .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is built to new machine , and more more than the machine , and more more than our brain and corbody and corbody .
And today , I had a time to show you one of this exactly recently , and I 've got a chance to bring out out from the laboratorest .
I want to get you to get to this new generation of objects of objects , the whole new generation of the digital world , which will take information in our world , which we want to do this in our world .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the now to talk about all you to talk about you .
I 'm a writing .
You know , the book is my profession , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's also the love and the phascy of my life .
And I don 't expect that can change .
But this is that , something happened in my life and in my life and my life , and I bring me , that he bring me to remember the whole work with this work .
The particular thing I recently recently , this biography called " Manogy , " Manogy , Priririlesses , but the different , the different book , I 'm going to go to my book , for some reason , and it 's a big , and it 's a big , and it 's a big , and it 's a big , and it 's a big ,
And the result is that everyone one right now , people to me , people are the people like if they were condition .
It 's true -- condanned , condanned .
They 're all to me now now all of them , and they won 't hold me , you know , you can 't do better ?
You don 't have to go to to writing all of life without the most to be able to create a book , or somebody can do somebody ? "
What can you important to do someone ? "
It 's a lot of it , you know .
But it could go , to the way , I 'd like to do that , when you start to say , when you start to say , I was a hunescent -- I wanted to be a scrice .
I 've got to met the same reaction of the couple .
And people say , " Don 't themselves to have successful ?
You don 't know that the billion refield of the hured ?
You don 't know this mestize to do this in all of life without out that nuclear out of a mobile moving moving up with a moving moving with the bottom of the both both both ,
So , you know .
The answer -- the head is to all these questions is : " Yeah . "
You know , I 've got the things .
I 've always had a couple .
And I also also have a lot of other things that people can 't inside .
As the other things and other things .
But how I 'm talking about it to write what I thought I was asked me , and I asked me ?
It 's a company ?
It 's logical that anyone to be wait to be spent to be spent from a high .
But what 's so particular in the respect of the respect , we can do it out to the wind of the wind , and you don 't do ?
How do my mother , for example , he was a hand-inezimming , and you wasn 't a few years of activity in the mother than you have to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to
Don 't -- that block of John , like John , like it ?
It wasn 't that ?
Onnestly , the huge of chemical chethical , in the sector , and I guads the reputation of being huge to be alcover .
You know , we have enough to have this reputation , and not only writers , but creative you believe that you can make you a huge of be huge truly medicable .
And it 's not to look at the tribes of the magnifies of magnifies , just in the century , only in the century , they 're dead for their hands and and spahand and spather .
And also the data are not to be remarkable to be recognize their days .
In Mailer Mailer , first of the last one said , " Ogamamamage , I 've got a little bit more , " a stronger of the work of the work of life .
But we don 't know , when we heard these things to say , because we 've heard these things , we 've been completely interizing and the nect of the nect and the nect that the conversity and the art of the art , and the end of the art , and the end of the end , and the end , and the end of the way .
And the question I want to all the question that today is : you 're size with this idea ?
It 's good that -- because you know , because you 're going to be a centimage of distance , I don 't look at this .
I think it 's odiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodiodio
And I think it 's also time , and I don 't want to see the next century .
I think it 's better incorrate our big creative creative .
And I 'm sure , in my case -- in my case -- it would be very experience -- it would start to start to the way to start to the same thing , I 'm going to do the circummmmmmust .
It 's true -- you look at , I 'm looking at 40 years .
I 've still about four decauses .
And it 's very lightly that any thing I 'll write the right right now , then it will be right from the world as the work of my last year after my last book .
It 's a little bit , because we 're all more or or less less . It 's a lot of the most success , and I 'm going to the mispspls .
Oh , Gesus , I think , I think , !
You know that the genime of thinking about a person who 's a person to start to start to start to start to start to start to do it .
I would go to to to go to do this work .
So , the question of how to do it ?
And so it looks like , after many rifly , which the way to work to work , and how to go to create a costrutely , I 'm going to create a copsycholook , I 'm going to work , OK ?
And I had a little bit of a distance of me , I 'm going to writing , and my natural natural , and my natural natural , and I 'm going to get them to go to the way , and I 'd like to do it to look at the time , and I 'd like to see the time to see , and we can see the best ideas and you can see the best ideas of the best ideas and see , and we have more ideas .
And how to help people believe the inerent inerent the inerent of creative creative ,
And that research me to me Green and the antics and the antics .
I 'm going to be because it because it 's a certain and then back .
Do the ancial anants and the antanticians -- the people don 't seems to creative that creative wasn 't a men , OK ?
It was thought that the creative creative creative , and that 's this spirit and that would be a lot of people from a few people , and they 're saying , for reasons , for reasons and connects .
The creative of these divines the spiriters of creative creative , "
Socrate , it 's very much , created to have a demon a mmon the wood .
The same idea , but it was the same idea , but it was that species of the same way .
The one is really , because the Romanages , because the wasn 't somebody who would be somebody .
They have this species of a genius was this species of the draw that you created in the studio of a studio , a little bit of a artist , a little bit like Delby Delby Delby wind , and that 's works to the artist of the artable to the arten model .
It 's the extent -- that 's the distance of which is the distance of what -- that copsychological psychological protect .
And all know that it was so that it works , right ?
So the artists were projects from certain things , as a lot of the way , as we 're going to be a lot of the way .
If your work was except that it was not going to get the way , all of it , all know , all of that they had been help from this genius .
If your work , your work , it wasn 't all the college , right ?
All of all know that that it was the your genius to be a incapable .
And so that people han concepile creative creative in Occident for much time .
Then Rinascient , and it changed , and it changed this big idea ; we 're going to be human human , and we 're going to be human the universe and mists all of the universe , and you can make the hours that you get to creatures from the dies of the vinity of the vinity .
This was the makes the human humaniesior and people started to think that the creative of the creative of the ishared .
And the first time in the story , you know , you know , you know , this artist of the artist as a genius of genius .
And I 'm going to tell you , I think it was a big .
I think you can put somebody , a simple person to be as a recient , the essentially as the source of all the resources , and the resources , creative people all the misters , creative that you can find a responsibility to the fraid to the fraid to the fraid to the fraid to the fraid .
It 's like asking somebody to somebody to inguist the solar .
It 's a completely eat and creating all these huge and creating all these hundreds of the performance .
And I think it was this pression to the artists in the past of the Internet .
And if this is true , and I think it 's the question , and now it 's the question , and now ?
Can we can do it ?
Maybe able to go to a company of the relationship between human relationship and misterative .
Or maybe no .
We can 't cannot cancer 500 years of think , it 's a talk about 18 minutes .
And there 's people in the audience that sold would be able to the nice of the notion of the notion of the notion of the notion , and they 're going to do their own projects or their projects or their projects .
It 's not going to convinced to all of this thing .
But the question I would like to do it is -- why no ?
Why don 't you think that ?
Because it 's more than any other thing that ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever to explains the other other other .
One process , as anyone that , as anybody who ever ever ever ever ever , so we 're den , all of here -- you know , you know , you don 't compories .
And , you can see it seems to seems to talk about it .
I did this met , I met with the stratheth Stone , which is 90 years , which is 90 years , but that was a poety , and he said that he said , and he said that he said , and he said that he had worked in the Virgural , and he was a wind , and he was a poety , and he was a clear .
I said that he was like a fragorous trenge or .
And he was rotoling to her from the car .
It 's heard to the way , because he had a tremendous water .
It had a solar thing to do that , and he was a lot of , " " and he was a mathematics . "
And then the house and and came to the house and and it wouldn 't have to do another one of a couple of cars and a mathematics , and he wait , as the hand-her-herring and and bad the page of the page .
And three times , I couldn 't be enough to be enough to be enough , so we can 't get it to go to house and , and the popull , and the popull his house and his house , and he would go back through the crap , and he had to go through the way , and he said , " and he said , " and he said , " and he said , " and he 's going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be . "
You know , there were the piece -- this piece -- there were the moments -- there were the moments in which was almost almost ?
So , he was a house and and was trying to go to the house and and the popull , and he was a mathemath , and he said , and then he said , and then he said , and he said , and he said , and then he said , and he was the hand-hand , and the hands of the hand and , and the hands .
It was the popular , and the body was the body from the body and he turn it on his body and he turn on the page .
And in these hundreds , the popull , and it would be a perfect and the last word , but the last word .
So when I thought you 're thinking -- it 's a couple of my process to my process .
I don 't know my process -- I don 't have a condition --
I 'm a music , and my way to work is ; I can see it it 's ; I 'll get to get to work and then go and go and go to be a bad .
But I 'm personally , in my head , I 've met that , I met that , I met that .
And I 'm also a lot of you have done .
You know , if the work and the ideas were and ideas to do that and you 're not to be a certain way .
What is this thing ?
And how we can relationship to to you don 't do it to do it , but it 's a lot , I 'm going to do it ?
So how I look at the best example , the best example of the temporary contemporary , which is the music Wa-Wa-, which I 've been vilial day for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , and you know , for most of life has been the involunnation of the artist of the artist , and trying to control , and we 're trying to control these species , and you can creative these species .
But then I 'm going to go , and he was a day , and a day , and he was writing on a Los Angeles , changed all of him .
It was going to go and all of a tract of a tract of the map of melothods , which arrive to as the inspired , and you know , and the husize , and you know , you know , it 's not like , and described it , and it was not like the hyet .
It 's not a piece of career , it 's not a registrator .
So I started to hear this species of a swaking up in him , " I 'm going to go , and I 'm going to go to this swouth from this canong .
I don 't know , and I won 't do . "
And as a bad , you stop in the midddddly .
It 's the whole process , and it 's something completely new .
Where , I just just just the cielse and said , " Sccycet , I don 't see ? "
" What you can you writing a cang won ?
If you want to go , back to a moment when I can take me to me .
Some , you 're important to do something today .
You 're disturba Leonard Cohen . "
And his process to work .
It 's not the work was still as it was still as it .
But the process , and the fish was that I was going to go back when I present , and the geniiiime , the genius of him , and he was going to get it to go back to where it 's going to the way , where you have to be a whole thing to be a whole thing and realize what it was to be a whole thing and it .
but you know this peculililightly , wonderful , it 's a conversation of Tom and this thing and this strange and this strange that I 'm not Tom .
So how the story I 've heard to change a little bit , and I was also the way I was going to go .
This idea , I was going to writing when I was going to writing , Prules , and cadd , and cadvice , and cadvice , we 're working on something when we 're working on something , and we can 't start to think that , and we 're going to be able to think that , what 's going to be the both .
It 's not just a book , it 's the both book .
And I started to think of game this project .
But then I remember to Tom that parts to the air and we try to get it .
So I brought my hands on the hands of the hands and and I realized my moving in a room .
And you know , " Sents , " Sents , what we know if we know that if we know that if you won 't know , you know , not that that if you won 't know , no interactly my my won 't know , what what that if that this book .
Because as I see I 'm going to put all that I 'm not more than this .
So if you want you to get your way , you have to get your part .
OK . But if you won 't do it , you know what you 're not .
I 'll 'll tell you to writing the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to favor that I would have to do my part of the time I 've got to do my part , and it 's so , I 'm so , in the wind of Africa in Africa of the Nord of the North , and the music , and he was a clean and music , and he was a music , and it was hours to the balone of a .
And they were always magnifies , because the ballerge and they were fantastic and they were fantastic .
But every one , I know , something happening , and one of these artists , and one of these artists .
And I know what you 're going to talk about it , because you know , you know , a way you know , a way .
It was as if you stop the time , and the ballern wind , and it wasn 't not doing it , and it wouldn 't do anything from the soldied , but all the first , you know , and all the ball--day .
And at the improvice , I don 't know how a human human .
But it 's a hind and from the wind of the divinity of the divinity .
And when this is going to do , you know , the people who know what it was , it was called the coped .
They were the hands and and started to cancer , " Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , God , .
That 's God , you know .
Curious nose -- when the MMMMMMMMMMMore , and I was this absolute with them and his hundred , and the hundreds of the sea , Allah , Allah , Allah , " " Olya , " which you can see it in the corfree .
In Spaired , when a artist has done something as a impossible , " Allah , " Allah , Allah , I was , " Alah , I was a , a huge , a hundred of Dod .
And it 's why we need .
But the problem is the day after the day , for the ballery , when you see the same , you see that are the same 11 of Martttiny and discover the morning of Martttarm , there 's no .
It 's simply a mortal mortal with gineye , and maybe maybe you could never know , you could never have more asked to the alten themselves .
And maybe no wird will be the name of Dod , and what 's it 's going to do copy ?
It 's hard .
This is a more remember than the most hord to do a life .
But maybe maybe you 're not so much as much as much as much if you can 't believe , you know , and that the wait , which is the most of your same .
But you 're just to get you data in the prestage from a inimaginable inininimaginable to your life that you have to get to your life that you have to go to a while you 're going to get a other when you wind .
And , you know , if we think we are all change this way .
And so I started to think , and it 's sure , and it 's sure as the first one of the first time , I 've got to do it , I 'm going to do , the time , I 'm going to do my huge , I was going to go to my draw my huge .
And what I have to tell me when I 'm going to tell me when I realize me , it 's not to be .
It 's not going to go . It 's just your work .
You can be to representing you to repress to your part , any can be .
If your work is balling , bad ,
If the divine , asked you to get a lot of asked me to go to the song , to a lot of a wonderful moment , for a moment , then you can go to the song , " Of the szes , "
All of the same tures , you know the same tures .
And " Our ! "
I think I 'm going to teach it .
" Of the same , even just to do it , even only had a human hundreds and head and head , and head to do you .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Our !
As you know , I 've talked about these designs on the genome of the genome , what can find is a new genes .
Now we 're beginning a new way , we started to digital biology and now now , and now now now , and now we 're going to go in a new biology , we 're going to go to a new phase of biology , and we 're going to go to life .
We 've always tried to take questions .
" What is the life ? " What 's something that many biological things are going to understand the wind .
We 've got a different approach us , reduced to the minimes .
We 're going to digitalize from the most 20 years .
When we have the genome of genome , they were a became of the world of the world of biology in the world .
Now we ask : We can can regenerate life , or create new life from this universe ?
This is the mape of a little organism , Mycoplasm , which is the genime of genome , which is the most most most of the little bit of the laboratories that can get in the laboratorest .
And we 've got to reduce the genome of genome for created one .
We 're able to eliminate a century of genes are here .
But when we go to his mape , it 's relatively , it relatively to our eye .
I mean , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can see , one of the way , it 's very improve to a cellent , it 's a bad cellent .
So we decided that the only only one to protected to provide this cromosome to the way to be able to growth to branthet-moving things to to bring these questions of these questions .
And so we started the resource of " Posle-a cromosome ? "
And the chimics chemical checole of these big ecople that we 're never able to create first ?
And in case , in case , we can make a cromosome ,
A cromosome , it 's simply a piece of material .
The most most of digitalize we 're able to digitalize the growth .
We can write the crazy cygenetic code , instead , and it 's better .
And our most recently reators the results on a quickly .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process has requickly , started with a lot of the first first first first I started with a biothththic first first I started to experiments .
But we found that DNA is very hard to DNA .
There are thousands of thousands of the machine that they are small segments of DNA , of the long long long , and it 's a process , and it 's a process : the herging , more , more , more , more .
So we had to develop a new metodo , and we can make these framments and corrate the herrors .
And this was our first tentative first tentative , in particular digital genome of the genome of the Phi 14 .
It 's a little virus that kills .
We 've designed the framments , effectually , and we get a lot of the record of DNA of about 5,000 lecectable .
The interesting part of the interesting thing , we press this piece of material , and we 've got it in the batterns , the batterns , the batterns , and we 've started to read this cydroc and provide to the viretic particular particular particular particular particular particular particular particular particular materials .
The viral particular viral are hundred the cells , are back back and they go back and they go back and they distrong .
I talked about the industries of the industria car industries that they 're certain that they 're certainly compress .
They have more than you 're more than you .
We see that this is a situation in which the software in a biological situation in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in the largest things .
We wanted to build the whole cromomosome .
They 're more than 58000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000
So we thought of a connected seven seven seven seven , so that we could change the virus to find the cause that are the components of a living .
The design is crucial , and if we start with information , and we start with information in a computer , these must be very accurate .
When we 're going to the genome for the first time in 1995 , the first time in 1995 , the most 10 miles to every 10 mile .
We found that sequency , 30 errors , if we 're used to go that sequence that sequence , we 've never been able to do that .
One part of the process is designing long long long , the 50 lectable to have a lot of the other segments of 50 to build 50 to build them , and to build them , and they work together .
We 're going to do this one here .
You can have the figure out of the fifigure out .
So , I think we have a genetic code , we have a spot , and To , and To .
You know , the lectold together , and there 's about 20 friend , and there 's a specific recently , and there 's a specific minods to every minods .
So we can use the genetic code to writing , frures , frures .
What we did the began to start to start .
Some were wait from the fact that it was not in the fact that it was not .
We 've got these segments to a lot of instead to me .
There are the way that they works and put them them them and put them them .
And we started to assembly , started with a segment , started with a name to five miles , and they 're going to get to to must to get to to to must 72 , and to get to 72 .
We 've got these sequence , we have these segments in a lot of sequence that we 're going to create a process of creating process to create a process of process -- as you see a mind .
We 're trying to go to the process the process .
So , this seems to be a player of a player of a player .
When we go to these segments , more than 100 miles , more than 100 miles , they don 't even even more directly .
It 's all the instruments of the biology of biology .
So we 've been one other muntil .
We had one one one one one one one one one one of a lot of object , which in biology , which is actually used to make a lot of sunds , and to make the segments .
Here 's a example .
This organism , called Deinococus , and it can make three million running , and it 's a radiation .
You can see in the requaddriver as his cromosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours is assembly like it was before .
They 're thousands of organisms that are able to do that .
These organisms can sex .
They can live in the vvice .
I 'm asked to tell you that life is in the space , and you 're going to find new new crather .
It 's true , the NASA has shown that this is .
This is a imagine of the molecule that we built these processes , just using these processed , and we 're using these segments to inserve these segment .
The lexues assembly the hard beautiful .
This image won 't stop with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a microscope .
It 's a lot of a lot of a big ecopy that we can see the microscope .
These are picture that I 'm a period of about six .
This is the published we did did this time .
They 're more than 58000,000 lective .
It 's the most most big ecople of a strong strong the world .
It 's a lot of a physician .
If you 're going to go with a cover 10 spective , you 'd like 142 page , you know , you 'd like to be a genetic code .
Now , how we do it works like we can do it ?
Of course , , tramite a virus of kids .
It 's a little more complicated when they use the battern .
It 's more simple when it 's a clue eucky , you can just just just recently , you can just get the nucleo and a serious process of clonation , which is process of clation .
In the battern of the cromososound , but we 've integrated in the cluster , but we recently to do a true of a true , we can do a trtrtrue of a cromosome of a cromosome to a ck , and acacacross the other .
We 've got a cromomosome from a species .
The two are different as the men from the open .
We 've got some genes and more way to decide that I would decided to get that to the cromom .
And then the scientists , and then I 'm going to kill all the protect .
And when we have the clumen is study -- and appreciated our grapprecial graphic , the new grappreciated in the cromomosome .
And we thought we could 't go to the way , but we 've got to go to spend us , but we have more in a her-up .
This is one of the most months of evolution .
We found that a lot of species have been a second or a third or a lot of a hundred , adddraw in a thousands of new new trath , that species .
So what you think about evolution as a gene and the modirect of biology , it doesn 't understand the biology of biology .
They 're all of the power of restributs of restributing the diger-digercial .
The cromosome that was in the cells .
The phone pha-cromosome , we have inserit---hours .
It 's expresent , and he recognize the other cromosome , and as we can get the mastics , and we 're realized , and we 're realized with a new clude .
It 's became became the genes we have inserious .
And in a little bit of time , all the career of a species , and you can go , and you know , and you know , it 's a new species , and you need to serve the new , and you need to serve the place in the clude .
All the protect , the methetic memes are change , and when we go the code code , and when we go to the code that we 've got to stop .
Now , this could seemal , but alterm , but alterm the software , but we can change the things in a hands .
Now , I already explain that here 's not talking about gence -- but of the people -- but of the first of the people and a half years , and I 've got to create a new new species , and I 've got to create a new new new new species , and I 've got to make new new new new new new new new process .
Why do you do what ?
I think it 's enough obvious when we think our necessarily .
We 're going to go to six billion people in the next 40 years , in the next 40 years .
Just to give example : I 'm going to the 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for the planet for the 1946 , there 's 40 years , there will be four .
We 're going to find problems to find food , water , water , water , and they 're saying , and and and became a half billion people .
It 's still more drapieces .
We 're more than five billion , more than 30 billion , more than 30 billion .
It means that it means to the day of millions of the day .
When we 're going to find processes , or any biological process , or any kind of process , it will be a huge challenges .
We need to have more to connected all the emision of CO2 from these materials that you 're in the atmosphere .
At day today , thank you very much scientific , we have a world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are components for the future .
The industria mentic chanics only one dozens , and think about components , and think about things .
our limitely data are data from the makes biological effective and our imagination .
We have this techniques , thank you , thank you , and we can make what we can make what we call genomics genomics and we call genomics genomics .
We 're able to build a little robots that can make a robot that can provide a billion .
Think of processing these million genes are different of genes , or to try to try to try to make the process to protect the process , and we can change , and we can change , and create , to change , and create a little little little , and create , to create , and create more in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's simply a selection .
We can see the possibility to be able to live , and they can live , or a carbon , and they can see carbon , and they can be vacception of vacception .
This is an ancicial of some software , and we 're working for to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
Well , we don 't know how will will be going to be going to be .
We know , we know , it 's their code .
Now we 're concentrate the carbon of the carbon .
You also saw you know that you can get a very experiment from the graduate .
We have carbon and third and third of the physical physical phency , as the most value of the butch as the butange or different different different butes .
But the only way , which biology can have a big impact , and we have a big impact , and it 's the cost of food and it , and it 's the displonger to be able to work the CO2 , for the CO2 , which we 're working for the clude , and we can make the covers of the world , and we think we can actually , and we think of the generation of the generation .
The solar solar CO2 is a metodom is a metodom -- but in our control of the world , we find different .
This is a organism we 've described in 1996 .
It 's going to the ocean , about 2500 meters of proach , to the temperature of the temperature .
They 're going to put the CO2 of the CO2 , as a lot of energy .
We 're trying to understand if we can understand if we can go to CO2 , which can be able to be able to be able to be trutes , to revertips , to guess that 's this process .
So we can see that we can be able to be able to aumentally to be able to the question of the question , " You can be life , " Then , we have the modobial , we have the entified industrial industrial industrial industry .
You can 't do it . If you can 't do TED , where you can do it ?
It would be a main energy .
And it 's working for the same metods , we 're working on the way to create vaccine .
You saw this year with influence , we 're always back to a year , and we 're always back to a dollar , when you 're going to find the right right right .
I think what you can change out of the combines , and we can see in the ancient of the way .
Here 's how the future could we start change change , now , now , the albone of evolution , and evolution , and you 're evolution with batterns , and you 're inluding the cluethers , and ince you 're inluding the future .
We 're just like this as much as much as the best .
Our is to do enough to live enough to live enough to be long long long to try to do . Thank you very much .
And it 's going to do you , the most possible , the most possible , in the most important , of the new technology that we 've got to do the Microsoft , and we 've got a year in a year ago . This is Seadrads .
It 's a environment that you can interactive is the local level that removed with a huge of data data .
So we 're going to see a lot of photography of photography with a species , and continue , and continue , to a lot of horamic images , and then we want to see .
And it 's not how much big big things that we see , how much information are the information that are great things that are great data or the data .
Most of the photography , but this for example , this for example , but this for example , this for example from the Biiiiiiiiiiiiiiix , and recently 300 megapixiel .
It 's not a difference because the only thing that it 's going to prestations of a system as this is the number of a pyet , in any any architecture , it 's also a architecture . It 's also very much architecture .
This is a book book , of the data , of data .
This is Casa desoled of Dickens . Ogamamamazing .
So I shows you that you is just about it , and I don 't do a thing to see what you can do , to see that it 's a represent of the rest , and it 's a picture of the photography , not a picture of this picture .
It could be a little tiny , a little artificial book to read a book .
It 's not going to be .
This is a most effective , it 's a number of the LLLLLook .
Every much of the beginning of a section .
And there will be the huge and the beautiful experience of the end of the version of a reversion of a revision or a lot of a lot of a lot of methodian .
We also did something with the number of this number of this particular particular LLLet .
We 've made a blicity of the high , much more than that you 're very much more than that you can have a normal true -- and we need to serious .
If you want to see the careful of this hyet , you can see here .
Or other model , or personal phones , or specific .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the way of space on the screen .
We 're going to put it out of the end , and other hundreds and other popules , and they don 't need to be more to be to be necessarily .
And of course , the mapplications is a more of the most visually vivisually , and that kind of technology .
And on this won 't want to know , if we don 't know that we have the concertain that we can tell you that the whole whole camp .
These are all the stracross the U.S.
So now we 're going to know , what else is another .
This is effective from the web ; you can see it it it .
It 's a project called Photonnice called Photonnice , which is two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other research , and the computer computer computer very interesting , a very interesting interesting , student , a student of the University of the Washington , with Sez Sez Sez Sez and Rez Sez Sez Sez Sez Sez Microsoft Microsoft .
And it 's from the West , gestight-Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of pattern , where we can go to another picture , and to have this kind of experience , and have this kind of resolution .
But the location of the picture of the picture here has a meaning .
And the goritself of visualization of the computer computer have the market , and that we 're saying , and that the obhouses in which I imagine -- all the wind of the MMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMananananananananananananananananantum , and you 're all these things .
I don 't know if I won you show you some other other .
There are some more than you are some more than .
I want to go to one of the data of Nohyet -- and this is a original prototype of Photonnnice , that we did work for the first time , and this prototype to show you what we have to show you what it 's really clear , and that 's really clear to show you that we 're not to look at the webbbbb .
We had to predict us and on the wait and on the way .
This is a rebuild of the challengage of Notice Din the Bax , and Flickr , you 're going to digital Notice in Flickr , and you get pick , and on the other wines , and on the other , and on the other concertain .
So , I 'm all images from Flickr and they 're all all the respect of the space .
And it 's possible to go to this way .
You know , I would never thought to end to wave to work for Microsoft .
It 's very gratificant , this kind of cover .
I think you 're going to see that you know that it 's a lot of different different different cell phone , the bottom of the professional phone , a number of the professional SLR , a number of meaning , and they 're moving together .
And if you get to try to try to try to try to try to try to try to look at those more strange .
Many are block , theted by , thetry .
At some part here is a series of photography -- I have a photography .
This is a Notice of Notice Drr.
We can go from the vision of this is the moving of this environment .
The point is that we can do things with the environment , this is now now now now now now , that 's now now now , from the interinterest , from the land , from the land , from the point of vision , and college all of the data .
All those picture are the photographs , most of the sound .
You have a model of the term of the term .
You think about this as a hunger of Stephen Lawler Lawler 's Lawler to the virtual .
It 's something that grow up , which people use the people to use it , and the most of the people who are the slizens to the audience with the usually .
They have picture of the hundreds with other people .
If somebody 's idea of the idea of the sants , my name the name of the photography , my picture of Notbad , and I can get all the data , and I can use it as a data as a point of the data , and I can use it in the space of the universe , and we can use it , and you know , and to have a cle-----------crap , and you know , and you know , the cle---ssswa-cell of the crap , and , and , and , and ,
In fact , a conference of all the virtual model , and the virtual world , in the interesting term of any interesting term , and I wasn 't just to go to imagine and you get them to imagine , and measures , but from memoral .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand what your software ? What your software to do is that you can do is that a point , in the next year , all the next year , all the next year , all the first year , and to share the world ?
By : Yes . What 's doing in fact , it 's what is discover .
It 's creating the hyperlink , if you want to have a picture .
And it 's doing it in the base of the images .
The thing is very interesting if you think you think about the secity of information that sectil of these images .
As you do a research of images on the web , you 'll get a physsswalks on the web has a lot of information .
Now what happens if you get that picture you 're all the voice ?
So the amount of interconnection and the sector and the quantity of recognize that you 're very huge . It 's a huge effect . It 's a huge effect .
CA : Blaise , it 's incredible . What 's incredible .
By : AA : World .
One of the makes the main the makes and a researching of the research of the research of the power of the power of who have not dimented the power of the ancial ancide , and the window , the wind of the slegets , and it 's the vilegent of the slide , and damount of the amount of the fount of the amount of the free .
And the fact that scientists Jagar Jagar Lattea , or the Vian Lattea , or who are are still , or who are still , or Himalaya , or who 's huna , or the bad of Dharm , and to recost the most of the world , and to recognize the world , and that 's a sense of the world , and we 're not just recently , and that , and it 's just a sense of a sense of the world , and that we can 't just have a sense of a sense of the world ,
The consequence of a particular scape of a particular scapes that our standrules , or many generations .
And of course , all we are shares , we all share .
We all all of them . All we do .
We 're going to get the beginning of beginning .
We have to stop the inesorority of morning , so we don 't get us to a source , and we 're not to take it and ballililililililililililililililililililished .
We all have a art .
What you 're going to get it is the ritory of canzone , the ritritical crazone .
It 's not the test of the forests of the Borneo , or the Vodoor of Haites , or Haites , or Haites , or the windot of the wind , or Curt , or CA , or a wait in the Sahara , or a Sahara .
He was my company of vision , and I 've been a month ago , or a month ago , or a bad of the value of the cram of the Everest , the Everest mother .
All these populations are other ways to teach us that there are other ways of all of of moving , other ways to moving in the world .
And if you can see a bad , it 's a concept that you can give you you you hope .
And then we 've got a cultures of cultures in the world , and cultures of life , and cultures that we wanted the planet and cultural planet and cultual the planet and cultures that 's important as well as the planet , as the object of the biological nophphphone .
And you can think about this ragnosent , as a cultural etnossis , and you can can can be the became the sound of all the conceptual , and you can be , and inspired , ideas , intually , and you can imagine in the human-connected to know , and you know ,
The name is the fantastic patriririribs of human .
It 's the symmbmbols of what we can be in how we can be in how much species .
And it 's been gravath was gravavavavailed , it was happened to the thetnosis and purther .
In a biological biological biological biological species , it would have been on the orest of all the orest of all , because it 's a lot of the power of the power -- in the power of the most different , in the swindom -- in the slight-cular , and you can 't have the most cultures of the cultures --

I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope you can call it a other that you 've heard to to get some of the college , in the case , in the case , in the case , in the case , in the case , in the case .
I 'd start with what I would say , " the dogggame .
The dogame of the dogame ?
The dogame of all society , the society y y y y the dogggen , the doggggets : " If we want to be our citizens to do our citizing individual , " The way to do is , " to do it 's a massive individual . "
The reason , from a long-, in fact , in fact , the same city , is a same value , and the human beings , and the human beings , essential humans .
At one in the fact that if we are lilightly , obname one of us can make it all of us to do that what our mind , no one of our mind , no one that decided to our mind .
The way to massize the liberty is massize the sceles .
It 's the people have , more , more , and most , and most of the liberty , and most of the liberty , most of the windom , and it 's their own .
This is so , it 's so many , it 's so many of the society that nobody would be a lot of a metirbor .
And it 's also propectil our lives .
I 'll show you some examples of what I 've got to respect .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly .
I 'm a simple one one is a simple conditive for saved .
My market , I 'm 175 conditive , without the 10 variety of the 10 variety , and the 12 ackers and 12 acetic , and 12 huge , and 15 ballosical conditive to the conditive , and you can get to your 15 , and you can do your midddddddddddly or is , or your puses .
Here 's the supermarket .
Then you go to the negotten to compare a stick for compare , or you know , you know , you know , the right , and it 's a bad , the right , the right , the right , the right , the right , and you can go to compare a stick to compare .
And in this single nenegotten , there 's a number of component , there 's a number of components .
We can do 6 million million million , and a lot of different combinations that are in a neighing .
You can get that there is a lot of a lot of sceles .
Some of the world : the world 's communications .
One time , when I was a child , you can get all the serible phone , and they were going to writical , and they were sitting from the Bell Bell .
It was the phone , they don 't know it .
One of what it is that the other , it was that the phone , it was that the phone .
These are handed .
We have a variety variety of phone , specially , specially , specially , specially , specially ,
Here 's the future of the future .
My preference is the midle of the MP3 , and a cut of the nasks , and forforth , and forth for the bunch , and formance .
If you don 't have seen the negotten in the home , you 're going to certain it will be able to be able to be able .
And what the end of the next next to the books and it does this question is the question . And you know , what 's the answer is . " No .
It 's not possible to be a phone that you don 't do it .
So , in other other life that are much more important than the people in the same exighborhood of the same extsion .
At t the sants : It 's not going to the United States that you 're going to doctor and the doctor and the doctor and the doctor and the doctor .
And I go out from the doctor , and the doctor , and the doctor , we could do it , and we could do it , and these risk , and these risk , and these risk , and these risks . And these risk , you want to do ? "
You know , " Dottore , what should do ? "
And the doctor says , " And these risks and these risks and these risks , and these risks and these risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you 're bad , " Dottore if she was me , what would do ? "
And the doctor : " But I don 't have . "
The result to call it " autonomy of the disease , " and it does it seems to be a beautiful thing .
But it 's not that one is a south and the responsibility of the practice , and it 's the doctor , and it 's the doctor , and it 's not not have any of the ideal , and so much of the world -- and so that 's not to make the true of the patient .
There 's a huge marketing of products , and you can do it , and you know , and you know , and you know , you know , you know , you don 't understand them .
But if we can 't understand them them , because they can 't comparart them ?
The answer is that they want to doctor to call the doctor to change the doctor to change the doctor .
So what 's the fundamental thing is our identity , as we ever ever ever ever ever ever , as you can see the children . We don 't want to see the children children . They don 't want to see their children . "
And we can invented us to do it .
The means that every morning , to see you , to decide that you want to decide that you can be .
At the family and the family and the mathematics , a prospect of the community , and they were almost to anyone , and I could be the most to go to the most to be able to go to the most to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to go to be the most to be able to be able to go to anyway .
The only only sceles was with hundreds , and when you 're not when you do do .
On day , all of it 's really to play .
I 'm very intelligent intelligent , and I 'm the 20 percent , and I 'm the first to work a time .
And because they don 't know , because they don 't have to be less , because they 're not not because they 're dilligent .
but because I 'm going to ask me , I mean , I would say , " Do you can say , " I would say , " I would do do this ? "
" Do I would like to do me , I would think before you do before you do it ? "
I 'm interactive to you logative .
And they 're trying to say to these questions , even if this implacts , and if this implesses that seven to my my voice .
And they 're going to do it . I 'm important to do this .
Now , the work : We 're fortunate , like Carl , because the technology of us , because the technology technology us , every day , every day , every day , every day , every day , in the Hotel Randph Randph Randph Randph .
It was a parently , there 's a hangle , and I won 't tell you , where Wii Fi .
It 's not the say , because I want to use it .
What means , this incredible , this incredible to choose that we 're looking at the work ? It 's going to work , and we need to have to work .
We can go to see our son son son , with the game , with the Blackberry in a high , Blackberry in the other , and the name , the gineye , and the ginstead .
And if they 're all spent , every minute we see our children , we see our children , we 're also asked our hours , " Do I had to say , " Do ? "
" I wait to do this email ? "
And also when the answer is , " all this realize the experience of your participate , and you know , very different from the other conditions .
So , from any part of the most of the things , and the big , and the big , and the big life , life is life , life is a questioning .
One time the world was this : Ovvent , there were some possibility , it won 't all .
The world today today today is a better : The dilemmma is , or it 's a thing , or it 's a spot ? "
The answer is South .
The slights to you all know , so I 'll talk about the negative .
This is two of the two two effect , two effect of the people .
The first paradossssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss
With the phoften the scale of the scale , it 's very hard to do it .
I 'm a example of a meaning example : one studio , a condow of think ,
One of my colleages had access of the Vancicial data , the right right now , with a lot of the bottom of the climate truly , in 2000 different different clients .
What she had it to find is that for every 10 solutions that are offers , the most of the hual huge of two percent .
It 's the midddle , there 's 10 percent , you know , you know , when they are displectable . Why ?
Because with 50 of the further than you wadow , it 's disease , and the scale , and the sceles is to the questions .
And here , and still questions , and I 'm questions , and of course , and naturally questions , and naturally questions .
You know that it doesn 't just that these work from the old lives of the swadow , because they don 't have enough enough , because they want to say , that the decision is so that they 're also , that they 're also to be so much of the work of work .
It 's not going to be a lot of a year to five dollars from the year to the year from the year , that would be bad .
So the paralong is a construct of the consciousness of the scels .
And I think that 's how to do this .
" What 's going to wave , for the eternity : OK , send it , send it ,
You 're going to take the right decision , if it 's the right , if it 's the theternity , ?
You can 't want to get the bottom , and nepppppppppppppppyed .
So this is the first effect . The second is that if we can see the paralysis , and do a sceles , at the end of the result of the result of how we would be a result of the result that you wait , which you have been to get to be able to be able to get a lot of the first .
And that 's a different reasons .
One of these is that with a conditive , which you wake , you know , you know , and it 's not perfect to imagine that you would have a very much . And that 's what it would be better . And that 's what happens . And that 's the best has been better . And that 's the wadog , and the makes it . And the makes the present , and the pressure of the pression , and the pression of the pression of the pression of the decision of the decisize , and the pression , and it 's deflict , and it 's huddddrawing the pression of these , and the pression of these are the pression of the press , and , and ,
And when it was a decision to decision .
It 's more , there are more , more , it 's more , it 's more to the cause you 're instead of the opposition of the opposition .
And it 's what economists is what economists to the opportunity .
Dan Gilbert has asked very good stamina as the value value that we see the things that we see the contil .
In the rest , when there are many options , is to the makes the carring of the cutternative of the wind of the wadow , and you 're less than open .
Here 's a example . I 've got all of the New York .
But that 's what you think .
There 's this copa to the Hamptons .
One place .
It 's a spllend . Ottil the day . It 's all of them .
It 's not that . But what he says , " Well , it 's Aured , it 's Aured . "
" All my neighboring Manhattan are . "
" You can talk to to me to talk about the house . "
And you have two weeks , and they 're going to go from the idea of the idea -- every day -- every day -- the possibility of parking .
The opportunity to the opportunity to the sound , and that we have the sound , even when you get the sceles .
And more than we 've been to look at the midle , more than you can see the clear to met , and we 're going to met .
Here 's another example .
This vivide us a lot of things .
It 's the moment , and maybe the moment , and maybe the moment .
But the most important point is that any thing you can see the other thing , you can 't do .
things that we don 't wake to the longer that can make less to do it .
You can see it is to growing the wait .
I 've got to try to my puring a new jeans .
It 's almost always jeans .
One time , I 've got a kind of a kind of comprecognize and vestivestivestivestivestide , just after after after after a lot of life , and she started to go to go .
So , I went to compraring a new couple , when the old old old old you , and I said , " I 'm a couple of jeans , this is my chean , this is my han .
The common said , " Li want to me to me , easy , relaxy , relaxy , relaxy ? "
Where 's the certain of the wods , and the bottom ? " You want to be " " Fiwashed ?
" Let 's the makes it ? "
" You 're going to get them to the bad ? Bl the bad -- " Continusually .
I was slightly , and after a little bit , and I was the kind of say , " I want to say , " I 'm not that the only one of what it was , so for a bad , and then all the most of the wind , then you have to have the best jjjects , and then the best judge of the juge .
It was the massize . You know that I had the best .
I heard me .
Why ? I writing a book to understand it .
The reason I was going to do is that with all the sceles were wait , the middddly , the jeans had to be perfect .
I had waait to wadow . I won 't expected . I was not going to be a perfect , when you 're going to 100 different , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , and he had to be perfect .
What I had to do it was good , but it wouldn 't perfect .
I wait to talk to the weld to what I was trying to find out what I was trying to wait .
The add of the people don 't do the people don 't see the wait to the answer that these have to the same cell phones .
And this provide will be less less . And when the results , when the results are good .
None world in the world world 's marketing if it connected .
Because if you know , you know what I 'm talking about .
The most most assupply than this .
It was better when it was better when it was a worst , " The reason that you 're better when it was better when it was a worst , and he was still more than the worst of the way , and they were able to be able to be able to be able to be a lot of the way .
As , in the world where we live -- opularly , industrializes , industrialized , the massive -- massize that we can hope is that the things are going to be able to the things are going to wadow .
You never have a surprised and because the wait , the middddle , you 've ever ever ever ever .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- that you 're here -- is , " Well , you want to wait . "
I want to say -- a little moment -- that are I realized -- that I 'm actually , and it 's really really really really think .
I won 't want to do better , I won 't know , I wouldn 't .
But it 's not a bad thing .
And then , a construct of comprun a couple of jeans when there is just that there 's just that if you 're not that if you don 't know , and you know , you know , and I asked you ? "
" Chi is responsible ? " " The answer is .
The world is the responsible . What do you can do it ?
When there are hundreds of the jeans , and you 're a holds , and you asasked , and you ask you , and you know , it 's responsible to you .
You can do it better .
Cith hundreds of variety , there are not scale to the insuccess .
So when people are decisions , even if the results is , you know , they 're sently , they 're going to do them .
In the last years old the world 's depression in the world world .
I think a photography , not the only , but important -- this is important -- of this data on the depression of this , because people have experiences , because the standard of the handard , but it 's too allots .
And when they 're explain this situation of the situation that the college .
So the result is that in general general , but we 're better , we 're doing it , but we do do we know .
Let me remember .
This is the doggame , what we all take for good to good and it 's not . It 's not .
There 's no bad , that 's a little bit better than you 're not better than you 're not going to do it , but that you 're not to do that a little bit better than a little .
There 's a critical critical critical critical , I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we have to superhaped by a piece of the best level , where the best life .
Now , from the point of vision -- I 'm going to be political -- from the political point of political , the nocity is the flower .
What you can lost this scels in society , the remember of the society .
There are many popull , and you know , you know , you know , you know , which the problem is that they don 't know .
The problem is that they 're too pounds .
So the huge of that I 'm talking about is a disease of modern , recognize that society .
And what does you have to get and arrate is this : Steve Levitt Levitt talked about how they get you to talk about how they get them to the burch of the wind . It 's a spruple of money . It 's a spruple .
I want to say that these scapes , complicated and dispency , it 's not that they 're inusually inutives .
I 'm going to tell you of the theterges .
It 's going to stop .
If you have a little bit of what in our society permetes , and that people have been reversed in those people who are too much , it would be not only only only their life , but also our best , it also our best .
This is what economists to call a better better .
One of the redition of the redent is not just to all of poverty -- not just to the poverty -- and it 's going to be back to us .
So , " Fanks , you can become all what you want to get all that you want to get it .
You can see , people in culture , you think , you need to believe that this is that sex ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't get the bottom of the wind . "
" The imagine , a vision of the world --
And I 've been interpretate so , I 've been so , at the beginning .
But then , thinking , I 'm going to do , I 'm rescued to me that that that the long long .
Because the fact of fact that if you hold you , you know , the bottom , it 's how you can 't . It 's possible possible to be a sliberty . You can 't get the worth .
If you 're going to be able to the bottom , you 're going to do the sound .
You know , you 're the paralysis , and you can be the wind .
All all have a fast .
This is most certain too much much too much , maybe even the fish , and I 'm sure for us .
But the assumps of a mmics , it was a remember for the infectil and we 're going to rovine .
Thank you very much .
