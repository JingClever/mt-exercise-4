Last year I showed these slides to demonstrate that the glacial calots , which for almost three million years had had the size of 48 million years have had the size of 48 percent of the United States .
However , this is underestimate for the problem because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice .
The glacial calots is , in a way , the clear heart of the global climate system .
It 's expanding winter and you reverse summer .
The next slide is going to be a quick carler on the last 25 years .
The ice lost lost are reached in red .
As you see , they expand the blue up to the blue .
That 's the ice in winter , which is the ice in the winter , you reach .
You can see that the cosidis lost , of five years or more , is like the blood , which is like blood , that 's like blood , and it 's like the body .
In 25 years , it 's gone from this ,
This is a problem because the warming of the ice , the ice of the ice , the ice of the arctic , where there are enormous amount of coal conglad that , skiing , they 're transformed into the microbes .
I 'm going to do totality of the atmospheric of global warming , that quantity could double , super-double , this point of not .
In some laghes , a little laghi lams in Alaska , the metane is already rebulating from the water .
The professority Katey Walter of Alaska was of Alaska was recently lay with a team , a lake last last last .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : You 're good . The question is , if we 're going to be .
A reason is that this termal environment that Greenland from the northern .
This is a glacial river .
The brought her levels .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the southeast Greenland .
If you want to know how to the sea level of the melting of the ice of the melting of the sea .
These corrates are increasing quickly .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the biggest blowing ice of the planet .
The last month last month , the scientists have clearly running that the ice of the ice is in negative , and the Antarctica , which is particularly rapid islands , which is particularly fasting in the skip .
Equival at six meters of the acque , like Greenland .
On Himalayas , the biggest blowing ice , you see new laghi lay , which few years ago were glacier .
40 percent of the world population was going to be able to be able to the melt water from the skiing .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the city of the city .
The bad has increased .
But when it decreases , the same happens to the powerful water .
In California , the snow on Sierra Nevada is diminuity of 40 percent .
The backage is in crisis .
The predictions , like you read , they 're free .
The growing growing growing in the world leads to a remarkable increase of incendes .
The environmental disasters are increasing a rhythm out of normal and without precedented .
Four times as many as many as many as many as many as the previous 75 years ,
This is a whole sustainable thing .
If you look at it in the historical consequences .
In the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 25 million tons of tons in the oceans every day .
Look attention the East Pacific East , the Americas , to America , to the west both , and on both the parts of the subcontinent , where there 's a radical reots of the ocean .
The major of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent of the use of fossils .
The oil is a problem , and coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with emissions , together to China .
And it was proposed to build many other central coal .
But we 're seeing a change of direction .
These are the annoullated projects in the last few years and some alternative proposes of the versus .
Everybody , there 's a political fight in our country .
The coal and the coal and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year to promoting coal , which is a clean oxymold .
And this image was remined to something --
Werse , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion lighons of coal shorts of coal .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second biggest flow of scories in America .
It 's happened around the Natal .
The nature of coal commercial commercial industries was this .
Video : Without carbon is a kind of alleger and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and growing our economy .
Frosty carbon is and more and more clean .
It 's in good price , and the workers and workers are keeping the stunning .
Al Gore : From here is a lot of the West Virginia .
The biggest minary society is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'll be clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Peloice Pelosi , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what about .
Al Gore : So the Alance for the Clima Proteition of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one part of it .
Video : Acore : At COLergy see the climate change as a threat to our business .
So our priority is to invest a lot of money in a effort of money in a effort to make public and confused to make a coal and confused to the coal .
In fact , coal is not sports .
We think it 's clean , also good , it 's also a good , a smoke .
So not preoken preokay about climate change .
Let me do it .
Video : Acore : Carbon : You 've heard a lot of it .
So let 's take a turn in a structure of the forth of the coal , as it is clean .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noiss , but this is the sound of the technology of clear .
coal consumption is between main global warming , but the remarkable rest , but the remarkable technology of coal warming that you see changes everything .
Let 's look at this : this is the odierna technology of clear .
Al Gore : Bend , the high-positive alternative connects to the economic question and the national security .
Video : Comv: America is in crisis ; the national security , national security ,
The file that the lines all of us : our dependence on fossils , like coal and oil .
Now , though , there 's a new , a new , a solution for using it .
Repose America : 100 percent clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to restop America to work , make sure us more safer , and help to stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that you would have to solve our problems .
Repowering America .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's about re-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-in-energy .
One of the fastest ways to get to the dependence from the combustible combustible that we kill our planet .
CA : The future is here . Vent , only a new energy network .
What we can use to two : Noves investment for a good job retribute .
Comment : Repower America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old African old African saying , " If you want to go fast , you go to the fast .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away , quickly .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED did an introduction in LHC .
And I promise to return to address you about how the machine works .
So here I am . And for those that 's the other time , there I didn 't have , the LHC is the biggest scientific experiment ever -- 27 kilometers of circumference .
His task is to remember the conditions that were present less than a billion second from the beginning of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
This is just a ambious thing .
This is the car under Ginevra .
We pick these mini-Big Bang inside the relevators .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLATLAS -- it 's large 44 meters and has a diameter of 22 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS , you can see the proportions .
Ten September 10 last year we have accesus accesus , we have accesus acceside the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was because it was immense to stick in control room .
It 's a picture of the first phasm of the first particle physical facility , both collision , by a part of the LHC , and spread particles into the remarkable .
In other words , when we see that image 10 , we found that the 10 september , we found that the machine worked , which is a great victory .
I don 't know if this to do is exultate us more or this , when somebody went to Google and saw the page was this .
That means that we have had a cultural impact impact beyond that scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , it was a problem with the machine , and it 's a problem .
These files least 13,000 amps when the machine works at the massive of power .
Now , the technicians between you will look at the children and say , " It 's not true . They 're too subtle . "
And they can do that because when they 're very cool the sodds become the cool slipping .
So , at less 271 degrees , at less , at a standing of the space between the stars , these files can bring that corrate .
In one of the guns of the guns of the nails in LHC , there was a fabrication .
So the files are warming slightly , and the 13,000 amps of improviously introduced a electrical resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnets more than 20 tons , and that have moved about 30 centimeters , and that have moved about 30 centimeters .
They 're sitted about 50 magnetic .
We had to take them , what we did .
We restined them and address .
Now , they 're back to all their place underground .
And it 's the end of march the LHC is is going to be again .
We 're going to accend , and we expect to get to right now of the data to June , and we continue our adventure to discover what the morning is the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents reaching the debate of science and engineering the debate of science and engineering . It 's easy to confuture .
I think that 's so hard , that 's so hard , I think it 's the value of things like LHC .
I 'd like to end with the words of a scientist Ingan , Humphrey Davy , which , imagine , in defense of the inuses of the puple , Michael Faraday , his puple was Michael Faraday , " Nient is a lot of human mind , that 's not a dangerous for the idea of the ideas of science are definites , that there are no mysteries , and that 's not about the trifloor of the worldwide , and that we don 't have a completes of conscious worlessness of control of control of concerned .
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to think about when , children , you play with kids , you play with the morning .
And as you understand how to realive them and afferring them , and you learn to think , and you learn to think and solve problems and solve problems and manipulating relationships .
The space reasoning is proptise to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , as information is inspired by the uslity of our interaction with physical objects , and my consulting Pt , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started asking , " And , when we use a computer , instead of having the only of the mouse chicken as a digital car that we moved on a digital , we could deal with the mands , a deserrate of the information with the handle of the handle of the information with the hands ,
and sistemarge to our pleasiment ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a words , a Siftable computer is a big computer interactive computer computer like a cookie .
In a words , a Siftable computer is a big computer interactive computer computer like a cookie .
It can move them with your hand , they can see " between them , " and they can see the movement and a radio screen and a wireless radio .
But most of course , I 'm physical objects , like the moronces , you can just move them .
The Siftable is example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they get more physical , aware of the movement , of others , and as they get more physical , conscious of the own movement , of how we move , we can explore new and fun interaction .
I 'll start with some simple example .
This Siften is configurated to show the video : if it 's a direction , the video step so , if you including the other side comes back .
These interactive rats are aware of others .
If you face them , you 're interested in what they 're going to do .
If they 're surrounded , they notice it and they can be a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , they notice it and they can be a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power of data , for example , we " fill " a color like it was a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurated as a bad baby and I can use them to the color in the central , where they mism are mixing .
and I can use them to put color in that central , where you mix .
If we 're too much , we can put a little bit of place .
There 's also beautiful possibility of learning , like languages , mathematics and games where people can try to do fast things fast , and you see the results immediately fast , and you see the results immediately .
Now , I 'm --
This is a Fibonacession sequence .
Here we have a words of words that 's half of the words in Scarabeo and Boggle .
Basically , at every turn a letter to any letter in every Siftable , Pratically , at every turn a letter to every Siftable , and while you 're trying to get words of control him on a dictionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , you get a new set of letters and new possibilities to try .
Thank you .
So here 's the kids came to the Media Lab , I did it , so that they tried them and I did a video video .
They 're very liked very .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people a lot of education .
You just have to say , " Compones of the words , and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's how other people who try it .
This is our header header header , on the right there .
It actually wanted to just impilate them .
They were only waves , for him .
Now , this is a cardboard application .
We wanted to build a tool for the learning of the languages .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Siftouched .
It can put new characters in the scene , solving the Siftouched .
So , it 's doing the sun .
Video : The sunlight is .
David Merrill : Now has taken a treat the scene .
Video : The arange treator .
Blaw ! Yeah ! Yes !
So I school at Siftable and put them neartable can make the characters of the characters --
Video : Bau !
-- by inventing their own history .
Video : Hoo !
DM : It 's a story with the open final story , and it can decide him how it 's going to .
DM : It 's a story with the open final story , and it can decide him how it 's going to .
Video : Volunteer : cat .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you a tool , realized , to the wild and exececececk music .
It 's a recently , recently , to truly truly and exececececture music .
Siftable here act sound here like the base , basically , and the base .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose to use .
You can also be insert these sounds in a sequence to buy your pleasiment .
And it just modify it just doing touch a sound and a sequence .
These are effects that you can check from the vive , like the revert and the filter .
Lake it at a particular sound , and then including to fage .
And then there are the effects as time and volume , and it 's the effects of sequence .
Let 's look at how it works .
Video : DM : We 'll start putting a base in two Siftable , we 're going to add the slide , we add the other base .
Now I put a bottom line .
Video : DM : Now I 'll add some percussions --
Video : And I 'll put the battery , so I can control the battery , so I can control the effect of the alive .
Video : DM : I can quear the whole sequence of the whole sequence by one side or the other .
Video : And I 'll add the filter to the low to the low to the low of expression .
Video : I can recombine the sequence " at the flight . "
So I don 't have to planning it first , but I can improvise , making it longer or more short .
And now , I can stick the whole sequence of sequence with the left Siftable .
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is building new interface new men and more like how our brain work .
And today , I 've had time to show you one of the results of this course , and also a few possibilities that we 're trying to get out of the lab .
The concept that I want to turn is that new generation of objects designed to interacting with digital media , which will bring information in our world as we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writing .
I 'm writing books , but it 's more than this , of course .
It 's love and the love of my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , I said this , something particular happened in my life and in my career , which led me to realibrate the whole life , and brought me the whole job with this .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called " Manogy , Prega , Ama , " which , " which , diversity , for a few reason , for some reason , and it 's a big sensational , well , wild , and it 's a big sensational .
And the result is that everywhere in the way now , people treat me as if I was convicted .
It 's true -- convicted , convicted .
They 're going to be worried and now , and they say , " Don 't you fear more than doing it ?
You don 't fear to keep on writing all of life without being able to create a book that can important to somebody ? "
what do you care about somebody ?
It 's rassure , you know .
But it could go worse , I remember that over 20 years ago , when I started to say people -- I was a adolescent adolescent -- I was a adolescent .
I met the same reaction based on the same .
And people said , " Don 't it ? Don 't it successful ?
Don 't you fear that the humiliation of the rejection refy ?
You don 't fear to do this all of life without any life without any of it is ever out of it and die on a couple of dinner with the feels of fallide with the full of fallide fallide ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I 'm fear of all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also fear of many other things that people could not have to introduce .
As the algae and other things .
But , how about it was write about what I thought and I was going to be a lately ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anybody who 's expected to be spaper by a job that it 's been born to do .
But what 's there so particularly in the impress of the nervous health of the health health of the health of the health of other careers don 't do ?
As my father , for example , he was a chemical engineer and I don 't remember one in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if she fear to be engineer ?
It was never -- that block of the engineer John , how it would it ?
Don 't work like this , you know ?
Onestly , chemicals like group don 't certainly have a group of the centuries , driven the reputation of being handed maniacis .
We have enough writers , we have enough this reputation , and not only the creative of all this , we have this reputation of being enormously unstable mentally .
And it 's not remaining about the dead of the magnificent deaths of the magnificent minds that , only in the 2th century , they died young and often them .
And the ones who are not suicipate is actually being dissatives from their dons .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , " Every my book killed a little bit more " A extraordinary saying a little bit more " " smart slives me a little bit more slives .
But we don 't buy bad bad , when we feel this because we 've heard these things that we 've completely interized , we completely interized this notion that creativity and suffering are somehow leged and the art , at the end , at the end , will be during the ancient .
And the question I want to take everybody today is : you know , you know , you agree with this idea ?
It 's good this thing -- because it looks at it , because it looks at me not good for anything to this support .
I think it 's odious .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see the perpetuated century .
I think it 's better encourage our great creative minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start fire out at the heading heading , especially , you know , most circumstances in my career .
That 's -- I mean , I 'm pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I 've got about 40 years .
I have still about four decades work in me .
And it 's very likely that whatever I write about it now is going to be judly by the world as a work that 's going to be able to the last last last last time .
I 'll be slavery , because we 're all more or less friends here -- is likely that my greatest success here -- is likely to my shoulder .
Oh , Gesus , who thought !
You know this is the kind of thinking that leads a person to start drink a person to start drink and I don 't want to do it .
I 'd be going to keep doing this work that I love .
So , the question is , how do it ?
And so it looks at me , after many reflections , that the way to work to continue to write is to create a psychological costruction , OK ?
I have to find some way to find a security between me , which I 'm write , and my natural anxiety about what 's going to get . And , as I was trying to all the last year , trying to find other societies to see if they could have the best ideas and more health of ideas and healthy to see if they could have the best ideas and more healther and healthy ideas
about how to help people create creative inherent the emotional inherent of creativity .
And that research took me to the ancient Grecia and ancient Rome .
Seguitem because it turns to the circle and then back .
In the ancient Grecia and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity was going to be , OK ?
It was thought that creativity was this spirit health and sitting that was involved in men , and unknown , for the distant reasons , and unknown .
The grew called the " Greek these spirits of creativity of the " demons . "
Socrate , wonderful , he believed to have a demon that else wisdom .
The Romans were the same idea , but they called that kind of spirit without a genius .
which is great , because the Romans didn 't really think that a genius was a very clever to be a little bit smart .
They thought a genius was a kind of entities of devices that created in literally walls lived in the walls of a artist , a little bit like the held Dobby , and that came out of the jobby the way , and that came out of the work of the artist and model the result of that work .
Except -- here , that 's the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological courial that you protect the results of your work .
And everybody knew that it was so that it worked , right ?
So the anti-cles were protected by certain things , like , for example , not ?
If your work was exceptional work was a good thing , you could not take all the deserve , everybody knew that you were helped by this genius .
If your failed work , it 's not all your failed , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a inable .
And so the people han conceived creativity in the West for a long time .
Then Renaisance came and everything changed , and it was born this big idea ; we put human being at the center of the universe , and the mysteries and the mysteries and and no longer left space and no longer and leaving space and no longer and leaving space and no longer to be able to the divinity .
This was the principle of human rational and the people started to think that creativity was completely from the ishing of the idividend .
And for the first time in history , it began to refer to this or that artist as a rather than one person .
And I have to tell you , I think it was a big mistake .
I think it allow somebody , a simple person to believe , a person who 's like a recipient source , like the source of all mysteries divines , creative , unknown and ethering and a responsibility that is a lot of psychc , humans .
It 's like to ask somebody to inguiate the sun .
It forms and bears completely the ego and creates all these intured unexpectations on the performance .
And I think it was this pressure that 's a destroyed pressure artists in the past 500 years .
And if that is true , and if that 's true , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe back to a lot of advantical understanding of human relationship between humans and mistery .
or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't sell 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that would be reading scientific suspicians on the notion of the notion of , you do that they follow , or failed their projects .
I 'm probably not going to convince you all about this thing .
But the question I 'd like to take is -- why not ?
Why not thinking about this way ?
Because it 's more sense of everything that I 've ever heard to explain the exasperformance of creative process .
A process that , as anybody who ever tried to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- it doesn 't realize it .
And in fact , it can sometimes completely paranormal .
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poetetesholding Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years , but it was a poetesse for all life and told me that during his childhood in the Virginia , working out in the Virginia , and it felt , when a poem came from the landscape .
He told me that it was like a fragorous air track .
And it was rotating to her from landscape .
It heard to come , because it was so much of the earth under its feet .
He knew you had one thing to do at that point and it was , " it 's words , " it 's like a matta . "
And so it goes to home and then it was followed by this poem , and it wouldn 't have to make a piece of paper and a match enough card and a match enough quickly , and he saved it and saffering it and saffering it and saffering it on the page .
Sometimes he couldn 't fast enough , so it running and running it , and it 's got to get to the home and poem her through the landscape , and she would keep her and he would continue to rotolar through the landscape , trying , as she said , " another poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece I 'm going to never forget it -- there were moments when it was almost losing it , OK ?
So , he was running home and he was trying to the paper and the poem was going through , and he was going to a match just the way he was going , and then he said , what was like to the other hand and the coffering .
And he was going to take the poem from the tail and put it into his body and the transply-page .
And in these cases , the poem was going to be presented on the perfect , but the last word to the first word .
So when I felt it -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly equal to my creative process .
Not all my creative process -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a mule , and my way to work is ; you wake up to the same hand , and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and pass us enjoy it .
But even I , in my headquarter , I have striked against that thing , sometimes .
And I 'm supposed to be a lot of you ,
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source , I could not honestly know it .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we stick to it out to it , it 's not going to lose your heads , but , rather , it 's going to do us remain sthers ?
For how about me , the best example of the contemporary example I have is the Tom Waits , which I interview a lot of different years ago for a newspaper .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life has been the incarnation of the cabinet art , trying to control , manage , to control , manage , to these sort of impulses totally interized impulses .
But then I invest , he got up , and one day as he was driving on a car Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going to speak and all of a sent tract this little broken of melody , which comes into the heads , electricity and fix , and the wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and it 's wonderful , and it 's not how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it has no machine , it has no register .
So it starts to feel this kind of old anxiety to have , " I 'm going to lose it , and I 'll be remaining obsessed by this song lost , and I 'll be repected by this song lost .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to the panic , he stop .
And I 'm going to do the whole mental process , and he did something completely new .
I just look at the sky and he said , " Don 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" You know , " Is it can write a song hour ?
If you really want to exists , you can go back to a more open when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you go to care to something else today .
You know , to see Leonard Cohen . "
And his work changed after this .
It 's not the work , the work was still dark .
But the process , and the weaving anxiety that was releft when the genius , the genius outside him that 's caused to the other than problems and liberal . And it remained that it was not a whole thing that she was , remained that it didn 't have to be an interior , and returned .
but it 's bad this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange thing that 's not Tom and external thing that was not Tom .
So , as I feel that story started changing a little bit the way I worked in and already to me once .
This idea , I was saved when I was writing " Manogy , " Ama , " and falls in one of those cave cave out of the dispersation that we cause all when we 're working on something and we can 't start thinking that it 's going to be a disaster , that that 's going to be the worst book .
Not just bad , just the worst book .
And I started thinking about throw this project .
But then I reminded to Tom that was talking about air and I tried to us .
So I put my face in the manufactured and I resses my commments to a vacuum of the room .
And I said it 's very high , " You know , what , we both know that if this won 't be very brilliant book , not it ?
Because as I see , I 'm going to put all that .
So if you want to be better , you have to present , and do your part .
OK . But if you don 't do it , I know what , I don 't do anything .
I 'll just writing the same because it 's my work .
And I 'd like to make it a lot of please that I 've been presented to do my part . " Because it 's like , OK -- severs it does in the North Africa 's deserts to the clear of the clear of the clear of the clear of the clear , danze and music that they were going on to the alba .
And they were always magnificent , because the balleras professionals were professionals .
But every once , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually .
And I know you what I 'm talking about , because I know you all have seen at a point , at some point , a performance that .
It was like the time stops , and the ballering dance through a kind of walert , and it was not doing anything different from the usually , like 1,000 nights before , but all of the time , it was moving .
And suddenly , not appeared as a human .
But it 's accened from the divinside the fire in the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , at the time , people knew what was called it with his name .
They were congible hands and started saying , " Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , God . "
That 's God , you know .
Curious known -- when the More the South , the South of South , I was going to this habitude with them and the pronoundine changed by " Allah , Allah , Allah , Allah , " , " which , " which , " which , " which , " which is still , " which , " which is , you can still feel in the corrids or the flamink .
In Spain , when a artist has made something impossible and magical , " Allah , " " Allah , magical , " Blah , " I 'm a waste of God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But , the problem is coming the day later , for the dance , when you wake up and discover that it 's 11 morning of Marteday and discover that 's the 11 morning of Marteday , there 's no longer .
It 's just a bad with the knees of the knees , and maybe it 's never going to be able to get to that alteize .
And maybe no one will safely be the name of God still as it gets the name of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful reconciliation to make in a creative life .
But maybe it 's not perhaps to be so angoscious if you can 't believe , instead , intural aspects of your own being .
But it was just created that they 're all sorts of a source of this squisity part of your life that you have to have to go to somebody else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think about this way all changes .
And I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly like this , and it 's certainly as I thought , in the workers of the book that I 'll publishing soon , dangerous , and I 'm going to be a very success .
And what I have to continue to tell me when I feel elected by this is , not going to be afraid .
It doesn 't go down . It 's just your work .
It 's about involves you your part , whatever it can be .
If your work is dancing , bad at at the ball .
If the divine , lights to you have a little bit of wondering , for one moment through your efforts , just for one moment through your efforts , then , " Ole ! "
Otherwise , do you do the same dance .
" Ole ! " " " at yourself .
I think I think , I have to teach it .
" You know , " to yet the same , even for having had to have a light-to-heads and tal tals to get you always always always .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
As you know , I 've already talking about some of these projects on the human genome , what it can mean and discovery new genes .
Now we 're starting a new path : We started to digitalize biology and now we 're entering a new phase of biology , we 're entering in a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We 've always tried to get big questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists have been trying to understand how much livels .
We tried different approaches , reduced to the minimal terms .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was to go from the analog world of the computer biology in the digital world .
Now we ask us : can we regenerate life , or create new from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the smallest genome in the lab .
And we tried to reduce ulterior for it to create a little more smaller .
We 're able able to eliminate a hundred genes of the square of about 500 that are here .
But when we look at his map mapps , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
Let me , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at a time , it 's very unlikely that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to progrew was synthesize this cromosome that we can modify the components to get some of these questions of the fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " Can we synthesize a cromosome ? "
It can be able to produce these great molecules that we never have ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever ever we could make it ?
And , in case , we can make a crucial chromosome ?
A cromosome is simply a chromosome of inert material .
The speed with which we 're able to digitalize life is growing exponential rhythm .
Our ability to write the genetic code , rather , rather procrete , rather slowly , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results it on a exponential curve .
We started over 15 years ago .
The process required a lot of pass , starting with a biothic ree-of-experiments .
But we discovered that DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of machines of the world that produces small segment of the letter , of 30 to 50 letter and it 's a degenerative process : more the segment is more errors .
So we had to develop a new method to assembly these brokments and correct the errors .
And this was our first attempt , to go from the digital information of genome of the genome of Phi X 174 .
It 's a little virus that it kills that kills .
We designed the fragments , effected the correction of errors and get a molecule of DNA , about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of inhert material inert and we put it into the bacteria , the bacteria have started to read this genetic code and produced the viral particles .
The viral particles have been releft by the cells , are back and destroke the E.
I 've talked about recently with membranes of the oil industry and they certainly understood this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his own hardware , in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the bigger things .
We wanted to build the whole bunch of the bacteria .
It 's over 580 miles letters of genetic code .
So we thought we 'd build it in seven of the viruses of the size viruses , so that we can change in seven to understand what the components of a cell living cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard of a mile of error for every 10 miles .
We discovered , 30 error , 30 error . If we used that original sequence , we would never be able to do it .
One of the process is designing 50 letter segment of the process of the process of the 50 letters of 50 letters to build more subunity than they 're working together .
We try to give a unique elements here .
You probably have a little bit of the bar that we put in the filit .
Think of this : We have a genetic code based on four letters : A , C , G and T.
Three of those letters together codify about 20 minoacid , and there 's a specific order to literally every lomining of letters .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , frages , thoughts .
What we did is autography .
Some of them were deliver that it was not poem .
We designed these segments to just just ununtil it with enzymes .
There are enzymes that repair them and put them together .
And we started assembly with the parts of five to segment , by five to seven miles , and unending them to a 24 mils letter , and then you can see a segment of 24 thousand letters .
So every step we 've produced these sorts in abundance so that we 're trying to sequence that we 're trying to create a extremely robustood -- you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatizing the process .
So , this looks like the tabellon of a basket .
When we get to these very long segments , more than 100 miles , more 100 miles , they 're not going to grow more directly in the E. coli .
It comes to the limit of the modern biology .
So we 've looked at other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism mechanism called recombination , which in biology , in biology , we 're using DNA can unk the segments .
So , here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiation , it can absorb three million rad radiation .
You can see in the super requarter as its chromosoma is .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly as it was before .
There 's thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely .
They can live under a vacuum .
I 'm absolutely certainly , life exists in space , and you move to find new water environments .
In fact , NASA showed that this is happening .
This is a picture of the molecule that we 've built using these processes , just using the lights with design appropriate .
The leaving is automatically .
This image was not taken with a microscope with a microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It 's a great molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that cover a six seconds .
This is the advertising that we did a little time ago .
They 're over 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the biggest molecule of a defined structure that we 've ever made by the human .
It has a weight of a molecular weight of 300 million .
If we 're going to take it with a 10 without spaces , it would like 142 pages , it would just take 142 pages , it would like 142 pages .
Now , how do we do it ? How do we do it ?
Of course , you loan , you loan is a guy game .
It 's a little more complicated when you use ,
It 's simpler even when it 's eucariote like our : You can just extract the nucleus and put another , which is basically the clonically process of clonation .
In the archaea , the archaaea is integrated inside the cell , but we have recently recently , we recently recently , we 've recently demonstrated that we 're able to do a cell of a cell cell to another and activity .
We could have a cromosom participating from a microbial species .
The two are different as the men from the men .
We have added a few gene in more way that we could decide what to choose for this cromosome .
And then skiing with the enzymes , so it 's going to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it into the cell . And when we put it into the cell . And you 're going to opprecise our sophisticatoes -- the new chromosome went into the cell .
And we thought we could not go beyond , but we 've tried to suspines us there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We found that many species have added species have added a second or a third cromosome from a thousands of new tracts to that species .
So who think evolution as only as a gene gene that it 's modified not a lot of biology .
There 's enzymes called restraight enzymes that advantage of the DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell , you know ,
The cell cell phone that we have inserit-fall that we put it .
It 's expressed , and recognized the other chromosome as extense material , has masticated , and we found it with only the cell and the new cell cell cell .
It became blue because of the genes that we 've put .
And in a short-time , all the characteristics of a species have gone , and it turned out of all the new species , based on the new species that we put in the cell .
All the proteins are changed , the member have changed , and when we read the equivast exactly to what we 've spread exactly to what we 've spread .
Now , this could look like genetic alchemistry , but it 's high the software , we can change things in a pretty sustained enough .
Now , I explained that here is not talking about genesis -- but progress to go from three and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion that will be created new version of this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's obvious when we think about our needs .
We 're going to go from six and a half billion people to nine billion in the next 40 years .
Just for example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 ; in 40 years , there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean and clean and a half billion people .
It 'll be even more tough to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion coal , more than 30 billion coal , more than 30 billion bets of oil .
That means 100 million baries a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or whatever kind of process to replace it , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep account of CO2 from these materials that ends in the atmosphere .
At day , thank you with scientific discoveries all the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are designed for the future .
The electronics is only about a dozen , about a dozen of components , and think about how many things have come out .
We 're limitations here are a relationship of our imagination and our imagination .
Now we have now , thanks to these metods of synthesization , that we can create what we call combinatory genomics .
We 're able to build a big robot that can make a big robot that can make a million cromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes or to try to get the processes and project to make optimize or drugs , new vaccines , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology , and create more biology that in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , production chemical or fuel , fuels or fuel , production of the vaccines .
This is an instantaneous instantaneous mostly programmed that we 're working on to be able to seat and design species to the computer species .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how they 'll be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
Now we 're focusing on the fuel of the fuel .
You also have seen you that extract from the grant was a bad experiment .
We have a lot of second-third generation , and third generation that will be soon as much higher than either value or different kinds of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increasingly increasing the cost of food and limitarm the cost of food and limitarm to be able to transform CO2 in matter , so we 're working on to design cells that can achieve this discover , and we think we can have the first coal , and we think we can have the first generation in about 18 months .
The solar light with CO2 is a metodowntown , but in our discoveries around the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2500 feet depth of the temperature of water .
They think it 's metane by CO2 using molecular hydrogen , like energy source .
We 're trying to figure out whether we can meet the CO2 , which can easily be transported by the way , convert that CO2 in fuel , to lead this process .
So , we think that we could be able to increase what we could increase what the basic question of what the basic question is , what is the fact is , the way -- we have the modity of replacing the entire oil industry .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where you can 't you ?
It would be a main energy source .
And we 're working on the same way , we 're working on the same way , to create instantaneous vaccines .
You 've seen this year with the flu , we 're always back of a year and a dollar under it , when it 's about finding the vaccine .
I think that you can change building vaccinate vaccines combined .
So , this is how the future could start seem changing , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating the synthetic evolution with synthetic bacteria .
We 're at a lot of the improving people .
Our purpose is to do a long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'll show you , the most quickly possible , some work , a fundamental work , the new technology that we took Microsoft , in the new technology that we 've taken in the following one year ago exactly .
It 's a environment that you can interact is at local level that remote with an enormous amount of data .
So , we 're seeing a lot of gigabyte picture of digital zoom and continuous queering , and a quick quick , and a quick speed , disponing the images how we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these are collection of data or images or images .
Most of the most of the digital photographs , but this is a scan from the Biooof-Congress , and refly into the moment of 300 megael .
It doesn 't make any difference because the only thing that limit the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen in any time . It 's a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , example of no images .
This is Dickens of Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
To show you that it 's just about textboard and not images , we can do something like that , to really show you really , to make a real representation of the textboard , not a picture photo .
It could be a little kind of artificial way to read a book .
It 's not about it .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of The Guardian .
Every picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the beautiful and the experience to read the bad version of a magazine or a quotidian , which is for nature , a lot of a lot of teapoor a quote , a lot of a half .
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of The Guardian .
We created a fasulla advertising -- much more higher than that you use in a normal advertising -- and we put you in the extra community .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see here .
Or other models , or even the specific specific techniques .
And this really shows some of these ideas to eliminate the limitations of space on screen .
We hope that this means to put up to the pop-up pop-up , and other porks like the pop-up , not need to be .
Of course , mapping is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this is not going to lose time , if not to say that we have contributes to also this .
These are all the streets in the United States , a geotherwise , in the NASA geospatial .
So , we 're going to go to something else .
This is actually actually , from the web ; you can go to the Web ; you can see it .
This is a project called Photosynth , combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual research as a very interesting research by Noah Snavely , a student of the University of Washington of the U.S. Steve Szeliski , the U.S. . At optimate collaboration .
And it 's from Seadragon , gestite by Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from one image to another and have this kind of multiple resolution .
But the space of the images of the images here has actually a meaning .
The algorithms of visualization computers have recorded these images together , so that correspond to the real place place in the real slightly scachieved , and these things are all sorts of the Roccious canader , they 're taken . So , here , you see , here , you have been taken . So , these things have all been connected to stable or imaging , and these things have been connected to the space .
I don 't know if I have time to show you a few other environment .
There are a lot more space .
I want to move directly to one of the original data Nohahy-scoring data from a previous prototype of Photosymptotype that we did for the first time , the ext scorsea , technology , Photosynth , technology Photosynth , and it 's not necessarily evident to look at the environments that we put in the website .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so on .
This is a rebuilding of Notre of Notre Dame images from Flickr . Baast Dame in Flickr , and you get images of the types in magicians , other people in the maglights , other of the campus , other of the campus and so on . Each of these connection .
So they 're all picked up by Flickr and they were all connected to the space level this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this way simple .
You know , I 'd never have thought I 'd never have thought of end up with Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying to get this kind of account here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different types of different kinds of footprint : from those professional sons to the professional SLR , a significant number , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try to look at those strange .
A lot of them are block , etc .
Somewhere you find a series of photographs -- here we are .
This is a Notre Notre Dame recorded correctly .
We can go from the poster to the view of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the whole dead of the collective memory of how the earth , from vision , and connects all of those data together .
All those pictures become connected , more than the sum of the sum of the parts .
You have a model of the entire land that emerging .
Think about this as a Stephen Lawler 's work on Earth .
It 's something that growing in complexity as a people who use it , and the advantages for people to use it .
Their picture are markages with other people .
If somebody 's idea of contrast , all these saying sankysks , my name of Notre Dame is a picture of the Dame is suddenly recognize of all the data , and I can use it as a kind of instead of instead of all this data , using the pictures of anybody else , and have a social of cross-mode cross-mode experience of cross-mode , red cross-mode experience .
Of course , a consequence of this is virtual models of any interesting of the earth , and collected of any interesting than the earth , and it 's not just a views of aircraft , but from the collective memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What 's good ? What your software is going to be able to do is that , in the next few years , all the photographs shared by anybody in the entire world will be basically connected together ?
BAA : Yes . What it 's doing is basically discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , among images .
And it 's doing it in the base of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the wealth of semantis that many of these images can have .
As you get a picture of images on the Web , you type of information on the web page has a lot of information about the picture .
Now , what if that picture is that picture connects to all your pictures ?
So the amount of semantic interconnection and the amount of wealth that is really huge . It 's a classic classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pleasure when you travel and one of the research of the etnographics of the powerful research between who has no forget the anti-traditions , the people in the past , touch in the stones , the wind of rain , levers , it in the leaving of the plants .
Jaguar thinking about Jaguar travel even beyond the Via of the Milky , or that the old Inuit 's still a model of meaning , or in Himalayas , the budddhidden , to remind the importance of the Dharma , to remind the importance of the Dharma , and that the idea that the world that we live in no exist , but it 's just a model of reality ,
the consequence of a particular set set of adapt that our own own own own own stris , very good or a lot of generations .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
Everybody is born . Everybody is going to create .
We 're subjects to retict .
We need to deal with the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprise and the ballit , and we 're going to --
We all have art .
What it hits is the patterns of the song , the rhythm of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they 're the Penan of the Borneo , or the follows of the Haiti of the Haiti of the Kaisut 's desert in Kenya settt in Kenya settlement , or a camera in the heart of the Sahara .
He was my travel in the desert a month ago , or a month ago , or a huge entering of the Qomolangma , in the mother of the world .
All these populations teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of model , other ways of modes of thinking , other ways of modes of the world .
And , if you think , a concept that it 's a concept that can give you hope .
Torse , together , the cultures of the world creating a ragnature of the world 's life and cultural , that we have the planet and it 's important for the well-being of the planet as the biological ragnature as a near biological rather known as a near .
And you can think about this cultural ragnature as a a rethnosphere and you can define the sum summer the sum of the whole concepts , dreams , mites , ideas , inspiration , inspiration , with intuitiitions , inspiring , intuitions , inspiring , inspiring ,
The etnosphere is the patrimony of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in as a species .
And because the biosphere was graving , consumed altrees as well as well as it was as much more rapidly .
No biologist , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the handle of the extinction just because it 's false -- in the most optimistic extinction -- in the field of biological diversity -- and not already to be more optimistic than the most optimistic of cultural diversity .
The index of all that is , of course , the linguistic loss .
When you 're born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the middle of human spirit .
It 's the middle of every culture of every culture is in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a way , a spiritual thinking ecosystem of the mind .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we 're sitting here in Monterey , at least half of the kids .
They 're not teaching kids , which means , unless you can 't change something , unless fidddle .
What 's more sad about being a silence , of being the last silence , to be the last to talk to a language , not have a way to get the wisdom of the children 's wisdom or ancient promise the promise of children ?
This is a fake was the somebody in a few weeks of the world every two weeks : every two weeks of a old old old moment and brings to the South tomble , the last sillabe syllabe .
And I know somebody who 's going to say , " Isn 't it like this ?
The world wouldn 't be a better place if we talk all the same language ? " Well , we talk to all yoruba . We talk about the cantonese cantonese .
Let 's talk about kogs .
You 'll cover a translated thing that it 's not to talk about the language .
I 'd like to do you a journey through the ethnosphere --
a little journey in the etnosfetime to give you a little bit of what we 're losing .
A lot of us forget that when I say , " different ways of exists , " I mean , " really different ways of exists .
Let 's take for example this Barasana , in Amazon , the section of anacony , the anaconda , creating the anaconda 's trusts of the latte of the snaps of the snap sances .
It 's a popular that 's not able to distinguish the blue color from the green because it 's the forest , because you cell is identified in the forest , which it depends the popular .
They have a strange language and a worldwide , determined exogamy language : : you have to mark a different language .
This is all has radical in the past , though the partnership of the partnership is that in these families that are talking about six or seven languages , no one of the marriages of mists no one practice .
They 're limited to listen to listen to it .
Let 's take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waorani in East Ecuador , a popular popular that has the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , in 1957 , they 've tried a commodity .
They did not have to get out of the photographs that were in a few who had been friendly , forget that this population population of the rainforest .
They collected the pictures from the earth , they spent it in the search of a shape and , not finding nothing , they 've got a concluded that it was the diaving , and they killed the five missionarise with the lance .
But the Waorani didn 't only killed the foreign .
They killed with them .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We 're risalites at eight generations and we found two of natural death and when we indeed to know , they admitted that one of them was , and then they had a killing of course , and then they killed him . Then , they had an incredible known as an incredible knowledge of forest .
The hunters were able to recognize the animal urine from 40 steps and recognize it .
In the first 1980s , I was assigned a very interesting task when my Harvard professor , I asked if I wanted to go to Haiti to Haiti in the base of the power of Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and impossessed to the Duvalier 's used to the zombie zombie .
To give a sense of miraculous , I 'd have to understand the Cooodoo culture and that Vooodoo is not magic .
It 's pretty much of a complex metaphysical view of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked you to tell me the great religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianity , Islam , Buddddddddism .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has not tracks . And instead of religious concepts . And Vooodoo is not that the distillation of these religious concepts of these very profound nation concepts of slavery .
What makes a voodoo interesting is the intense report between life and death .
So , the people are going to be the spirits .
The spirits can be invited by the Grande Acqua , they respond to the rate of the dance of the dance and replace temporary soul of the vive way that for a brief across the following one is the god .
So , the vooodooists love to say , " You 're going to ask , " You know ,
We say in the temple and forget God . "
And from the moment you 're going to be , is the spirit that you 're driving you , how do you do the bad you ?
So you see these incredible events : follow voodoo in state of trance that touch unfuels touch a demonstration demonstration , a rather strong demonstration , when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme extreme , when it 's catalyzed .
In all the popular people that I lived the most extraordinary of the Sierra Nevada , the Kogi Nevada de Santa Marta , in Colombia section .
Defenings of the ancivilization , once they live on the character in the Colombic planning of Colombia in the conquering , the popular massive civic civic massive civic civic civic planning that 's characbics .
In a blood continent slide , this popular populated , it 's never been conquered by the spages .
At today , they 're governed by a cler-cler-ced clero .
The young people follow away from the family to three or four years , and they live secreged in a good world , and they have secreged in a good world and shake in the basic of the ice of the ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years , to reproduce the nine months of gestation that spent in the user of mother , now are metaphor in the user of the Great Mother .
So , all this time , they 're acculturated to values of their society , values that they predict their predict and only their prayers , they keep the cosmic balance -- or to say , " balance balance .
At the term of this incredible initiation , they 're improviously taken out and for the first time in life , at 18 years , they see a tape . And in that account of the first wrong landscape , when the sun is wrong valued , everything that they 've learned in theory , it 's a furban back to the whole theory of the landscape , and it says ,
" Visto ? I 'm like you .
It 's amazing . It 's about you protect it . "
They 're called the greatest brothers and say that we , brothers , we 're the color of the destruction of the world 's destruction .
This is intuition is extremely important .
When we think about Indigene and the environment , we 're invoked Rousing and the old story of the noble self-vage , which is a razy concept in its simplicity or perhaps we 're closer to the Toreau and say that we say that populations are closer to the Earth of us .
The Ingenes are not feels , not feels of the nostalogy .
There is no space for these things in the malaries of the Aster 's winds or winds of the Tibet , but thanks to the time and retes , they created a mystical mystical mystical consciously , but on a bunch of the concept that the Earth can only live only is near .
What do you mean ?
It means that a kid of the Ande that growing boy , and it 's a clumn is a Apu wait will be a human destiny , it will be a different deeply different relationship with the mountain or that place of Montana or that place is a different relation-report of Montana , and it 's a clay mass of the Montana of the Montana of being swed .
That 's the dimora of a spirit or a mineral city is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the report between the natural and the natural world .
I grew up in the forest of Columbia Britannica creding that forest to be cut .
This is made me a human being being a different from my friends Kwakiututl believe that the forest is the Hukuk 's dimora of Hukuk and the paradise of paradise and the cannibal sangs that live in the north of the world , spirits that they 're in the extreme .
If you start to look at these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of their sensitive discoveries .
I took this picture to open in the northern Amazon Northeless .
Mayahuasks about the ayahuisasks , the most powerful substance of the sciamanic repertory .
What makes the ayahuasks the ayahuisn 't the potential of the substance , but its elaboration . It 's two elements .
From a side , this light-flian side of Tiel-carbolin , harmine and harmine and harmed , slightly hologiene .
Take the only plant you have a blue smoke that alters a little bit the consciousness , but it 's mixed with the leaves of a family of the Psychotria redis .
This plants has triple powerful powerful , very similar to serotonin , methyltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltrymine .
If you ever see Yanomami , you 'll see the nose of the nurs , the sustainance that make from a different set of species , anchyltryltryltryltryeld .
At that poll on the nose is a little bit like being disappeared by a smoke of painting paints and land on a sea of electricity . It doesn 't create a distortion of reality ; it 's not a distortion of reality ; it creates the dissolution .
I was often I was often with my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who have taken the psychedelic was in the 1930s in Mexico .
I think , my thesis , you can 't get these tripamines like hallucinogens because if you can 't tell anybody to be told . Think of triployed . The triptamines can 't be horical because they 're denatured by a way , because they 're money from a physical encycle , deted monoxinept that you can 't tell a very high monoxioxed .
It 's possible to be absuit of just if you just have a little bit of other chemicals that money the MAO .
Now it 's the beautiful : carboline dies that are in this liana liana are injur of the same kind of need to be able to be able to be able to to tripamine . The question is spontaneous sorts : in a plants of 80,000 species of plants , like these popular people , but that if you combine , it 's a biochemicals that is sudden to the summmer ?
We use the great heaviate hemistake and error , which can revealing .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " The plants are talking about . "
What do you mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 varieties of the ayahuasks , which are behind our gained glass into the same species .
If we ask them how to stage their tasonomous tells us , " I thought of the plants , you don 't know all ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take the 17 varieties in a night of moon and each other is going to be a different .
With this is not a laurea at Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that contt the stams .
Now , [ , ] the problem is that even those of us who have at heart people in ingenes are found them paper but in some way reduced to the margins of history in our real world , and pass .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it 's not going to reminded for the wars or its innovations , but rather like the era that was where we stopped and we hured and we hured actively or passiately , the destruction of biological diversity of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All the cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new chance of life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux didn 't stop being Sioux when they put out of the arrow and flown as Americans don 't stopped to being Americans and flipped .
It 's not the change or technology that threatening the integrity of ethnosphere .
The flight of the domination .
And if you look at the world , you 'll find that these are not cultures are not cultures destined to disappear .
They 're living and dynamics and dynamics are dynamics out of identify identify that are beyond their adaptation .
The under the patrit of disboscaring in the Patrit --
a popular nomake Sarak , in the Southeast Asian popular popular who lived on the forest to a generation , and now reduced to the service and the prostitution on the rivers of the rivers of the rivers , where you can see the river from the riverse of the riverse of the ridge , where you can see the river of the navi Merian , where the navi was running of the horizundred ,
ready to refill the stick with the wood dream of the forest .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that have come to the discovery of the golder .
If we move on the Tibet , where I 'm doing many research , you 'll see the hard of political domination .
As you know the genocide , physical extinction of a popular population , but the etnocide , ethnocide destruction of a popular lives , not only is convicted , but it 's not convicted , but it 's not convicted , but it 's a cell of development , because it 's part of the strategy .
And you can 't understand the Tibet until you 're not part of the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in the West in China through the South East Tibet , coming to Lhasa with a young lines , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what 's behind is , what we 're going to talk about .
6,000 slands reduced to dust and crazy .
1.2 million people killed by military military people in the Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical to Panchen Lama .
which means that it 's been killed to the time of Chinese invasion .
Her uncle is further with Sua Santity of the diaspora that has brought the popular in Nepal .
His mother was impresoned and his color was to be rich .
It was brought to hidden in the age of two years , born under his gunder his gunder his guns because it could not live in his own .
The sister , which did the same , was put in reeducation .
One day has weared a day a couple of Mao and , and this transgression , has been mitted to the works of the works of seven years .
The Tibet can be insured untiable , but the reference of the popular is to the reinside of the popular is .
Finally , all , it reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the world of monocroyed , or we want to across the poloxide world 's worldwide ?
The great anthropology Margaret Mead , before he died said that his biggest was that , in our lives to go to this love of the world , not just see the whole game of human imagination of human imagination , but one day we 'll see us from a sleep , but one day we 'll see us from a sleep sleep , but one day we 'll see us from a sleeping of sleep .
And it 's humiliating our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The Neolitic Rivolution , which gave us the agriculture , which made us sucy to the culture of the seed of the cler , replace the soul of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
modern industrialized world has 300 years .
That 's not suggests that we have the answers that we have the answers to all the challenges that we 'll have to deal with millennia .
When these miric cultures of the world is asked what it means to be human , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that all of us realize the possibility of being what we 're : we 're aware of , that it has to make all the people and the gardens can trunk . And there 's great optimism .
I took this picture on the northern extremity of the island of Baffin , when I went to the dry of the Baffin the Inuit , Olaya , Olaya , I told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The canadly canady is not always been kindness with the Inuit and the 1950s to stabilights , we rink them in colonies .
The grandfather was refused to go there .
The family , I 'm afraid for his life , brought all the arms , and all his attacks .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't themselves the cold , exploit .
The bad bats were made of fish in origin were made of the skin skin skin .
The grandfather did not intimise from the Arctic or the library of the library .
It 's gathered out , it 's hot the pantalones in focused in the skin and defecated in its hand . When the phoces are conglama .
It spred on the points of this crap and when it became solid , and when it solid became solid .
He goes down the dog and created a shirt , with the handle hauled cash , he created another dog dog , and it 's disappeared on the bankners .
We want to talk about cavarrate with nothing ? [ Rism , in different ways , [ Applausi ] is the symbol of the resilience of Inuit and all the people in the world .
In the open , 1999 government government has given to the total Inuit , the total control of the larger California and Texas mitted as together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's an independent territory . They all the minerary resources .
One is a beautiful example of how a nation-state can reconciliming with his popular .
And , finally , I think it 's pretty obvious about who of us was in these zones of the planet , remote zones of the planet , remote that they 're not remote .
For somebody is home .
They represent human imagination that are representing human imagination that are at the head of the days . And for us all , the dreams of these kids , like dreams of the hope .
Finally , we have National Geographic we are convinced that politicians will never get to nothing .
We believe that polemissions --
[ Applathus ] not are persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the world stories . Every month , our month is 35 million lives . Every month 35 million lives . Every multiple monkey site . Every mad site . ]
156 countries transmitted our television canal .
Our reviews are laughed by millions of people .
Our work is travel to the ethnosphere to bring our audience in a place of cultural wonders that they 're going to go out and hopefully , huge , they 'll be huge , and hopefully haby for the main revelation , the world of exists , and we have to find a style of life in a multicultural world
where the wisdom of all the popular wisdom .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some of some things I wrote in this book that I hope you 've already heard of other than you have heard and try to evidence some of connections , in fact , not the notails .
I want to start with what I call " the dogma domma officer . "
The offical dogma officer of what ?
The offical dogas of all industrial society of the West domas the dogas : " If we want to massive measure : " If we want to massive wealth of the citizens . "
The reason is , from a side , in the fact that freedom is in itself a value , useful , essential , useful , essential for human beings .
The other is that if we 're free , each of us can act for all of us can act for all that massive , to do everything that massive , without any decided in our well-us that decided to our well-us that 's fairly nests in our well-us that we 're free .
The way to massive freedom is massive freedom .
More people have , more choices , the more than they are free , and more is their well-being .
This , I think , it 's so deeply radical in society that no one would have to put it in doubt .
And it 's also deeply falls in our lives .
I 'll show you a few examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly big .
I 'm going to give me a simple note about inherent .
In my supermarket , there are 175 condition , without the 10 oil of oil , and 12 of olive oil and 12 acetes , and the 12 acetes that you can buy for you a huge number of constantly constantly in the craft that no 175 already is already of your degree .
This is what supermarket is .
Then you go to the electronics to buy a stereo : CD stereo , lector CD , lector , radio , radio , the CD , the amplifier .
And in this single electronics store , there 's a big car component .
We can do six million and a half of different combination using the components that there are only in one store .
You need to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Other the camps : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , you could get all the phone services of the phone , the bad was provided by mom Bell .
It was doing the phone , it was not going to buy it .
A consequence of that , by the way , it was that the phone was never going to break .
These days went .
Now , we have a variety of telephones , especially in the cell .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite is the middle , MP3 , cut hundred , and the nse of the bird of the blading .
If you don 't see it in the store under the store , you 're going to soon .
And what 's going to end up is that people enters in the stops and the question . And you know , what 's the answer is " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the acquired of the acquired explosion of choices .
About health , " Audge health , you don 't have any more than you go to the doctor and doctor tell you you you must .
Instead , you go from the doctor , and doctor says , " OK , we could do A , or B , " A , " A " A , " A " A has these benefits and the risks . What do you want to do ? "
Does you say , what would I do ?
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks and these risks and these risks benefits and these risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebad , " Dr. " If she was me , what would it do ? "
And the doctor : " But I 'm not she . "
The result is the result of the malate , expression that makes it seem to be a beautiful thing .
But it 's actually not that a move the weight and responsibility of making decisions that have to somebody knows that 's doctor , to somebody else knows anything -- and almost certainly it 's sically sick -- and so not in the ideal condition to take it decisions , which is that you can 't have any of the patient .
There 's a huge marketing of pharmaceutical products , direct to people like me and you , that if you think about it has no sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do they publishing them ?
The answer is that they want to do it .
Something that is fundamental as our identity is a question of choice , as you see in this vision , as you see in this vigness . " We don 't want to give kids . Scex their sex at the right time , " We don 't hert identity to the right time . "
And we can reinvent us how many times we 're doing .
which means that every morning , at the morning , at the time , you have to decide that kind of person wants to be .
I 'm going to be push to the family , a time , common perspective , almost for anybody , was that it was that it was that was that was that was the most soon possible , and he was going to get to the most soon as possible .
The only real choice was with who , not when , and not when , and not even what to do after .
At day , it 's really to play .
I teach very intelligent students , and I do 20 percent of work than a time .
And not because they 're less smart , because they 're not because they 're diligent .
but why are I impensiered , I mean , " Would I married or not ? " I 'm going to marry or not ? "
" Would I be marrier later ? " I think about the kids or the career ? "
They 're logoring .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even though this implay , but it doesn 't just get a good vote to my extent .
And they really have to do it . They 're very important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl underlucky , because the technology allows us to work every day , every single day , every corner of the planet , except that from Hotel Randolph .
And it 's a parented cornering , and I 'm not going to tell you what , where the WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What it means , this incredible freedom of choice that we have about work ? Is we have to go on the work ? Is we have to work or not .
We can go to see our child , and the cell phone , with the cell phone in a pockberry , the Blackberry , and the noteteaching books .
And even though they 're all spent , every minute that we see our child rowing child , we 're also asking , " Do I have to respond to this called ? "
" I have to say to this email ? "
And even when the answer is no , this makes the experience of your child guns very different than it would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the little things , and big things , and big , material objects and lives , life is a question of choices .
The world was this : On , there were some possibilities , but it was not a question of choice .
The world today looks like this : Is it is , " Is it a good thing , or negative ? "
The answer is , " Shand , " The answer is .
We all sorts of the slide , so I 'll talk about the negative ones .
All this is a lot of fairly two negative effects of people .
The first , paradoxally , is that produces paralysis that produces instead of liberation .
With a lot of options between which you choose , it becomes very hard to do it .
I offer you a meaning : a study conduced on flies of volunteer .
A colleague has access to Vanhealth data , the gigantic data , with about a million client clients have about a million client client improved in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are being offered in more , the lower percentage of two percent .
With 50 funding funding on , there 's 10 percent adesions than when they 're available to when they 're only available . Why are it ?
Because with 50 funds of the flows , is sick of it is sically hard to decide , and the choice is remaining .
And I 'm going to ask , and again , questions , questions , and of course , questions , and of course , questions never get .
You know , it doesn 't mean that it means that these workers are going to be handing food for canoes because they 're not going to say that the decision is so ostics that they 're also losing the complementary of work .
Not participating , they 're losing to five dollars from the dator of the dator , which would be well disposes .
So , the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it makes the world like this .
" And finally , " eternity : ketchup , senaps , ketches , senaps or maionese ? "
You just want to take the right decision , if it 's for eternity , if it 's for eternity , right ?
You don 't want to pick the source , and you don 't want to choose the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoid the paralysis and do a choice , we 're finally unsatisfied by the result of how we could we be with less options of how we could choose .
And that 's for several reasons .
One of these is that with many condition of condition between them , and it 's not perfect , it 's very easy , it 's very easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that would be better . And what 's what 's happening is better . And what 's happens is better . And what 's happening is the alternative , and the required diminished the decision ,
And when it was a good decision .
More , there are , more is , more it is easier of any detail that 's easy of any choice .
And there is , there 's what economists call constery .
Dan Gilbert asked very well as a value of the value that we 're going to do things about what we 're doing .
In the rest , when there are many options of options , it 's easy to represent the characteristics of the options of the options that are options .
Here 's an example . I school with all the people who are not New York .
But that 's what you probably think .
There 's this bad at the Hamptons .
A place of lussize .
Soldendida . It 's all days . It 's all for them .
Not handle . But what he thinks is , sick , it 's Augosting . "
" All my neighbors to Manhattan is away . "
" I could talk about front of home . "
And it 's pass two weeks , from the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The constood satisfting for what we have , even when the choice was excellent .
And the more are the options that we have to consider , the more the characteristics will be returned against the constantly opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This is a lot of things .
It talks about living the moment , and maybe slowly .
But the most important point is that whatever you choose , you 're squeeeass not to do others .
The things that we don 't choose have many attractive attractive that can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : it 's a growing of the expectations .
I tried it on my skin skin a couple of jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
And once the jeans were just like , they buy them and bought them and balance , they were moved , just after having them a lot of times , they were moving , and a lot of times , they started to go well .
So , I went to buy a new new , when the old those old were , and I said , " I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cut . "
The question was said , " He wants to slim , easy fit , he 's relaxed , relaxed quick ? "
He wants to them with the buttons or with the bottons ? " Stonewashed , " or " acacident " ? "
" Do you want to be strapted ? "
" Sotto want to the blaws ? Build blaw -- " Continured . "
I was slamored , and after a little bit of the kind of , I was able to say , " I want to the guy " I want to do the kind of thing , so for a time for a time , I tried to do everybody jeans , and then I came out of the best couple of jeans , and I was going to be .
It was the massive . I had got the whole choice , I had got the best .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a whole book to understand it .
The reason I was worse is that with all that choice , the mies were very high , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was going to be a minime . I didn 't expect anything except when it 's only a kind of a kind of thing , but when it 's only a kind of meless , at least a kind of had to be perfect .
What I was bought , but not perfect .
After I had compared that I was trying to what I was trying to instead of expectations .
The addition of options in life does not make people that are not going to be able to increase the excellence of the same .
And this will produce less satisfy , even when the results are good .
No one in the world of marketing in the world of marketing .
Because if you know , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth of it looks more like this .
" It was better when it was worse , " The reason you were better when it was worse is that when it was worse was worse , when it was worse was possible to meet .
At the world , we live in the world we live -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the expectation of perfishing , is that the things are at the height of the expectations .
You never surprised because your expectations , because your expectations , my expectations are ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse expectations " Yes , you want to . "
I mean , a little moment moment -- which I 'm really married and my wife is really amazing .
I could not do better , I could not do , I don 't have accontent .
But it 's not always a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of the buy of jeans , when there 's only that you 're just that when you 're not satisfied , and you say , " Why do you ? "
" Who 's responsible ? " " The answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What could I do with it ?
When you have hundreds of jeans , and you buy a lot of jeans , and you ask you who is responsible , and you ask you who is responsible , it 's as clear as the responsible to you .
You 'd have a better .
With hundreds of available variety , there 's no scuses for the insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is , they feel satisfied and give the colse to the same .
In the last few years , depression is exploded in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but that 's important , of this wave is just that the people have deludgments because the standards are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that color is them .
So the end result is that we 're in general , objectively , but we feel worse .
Let me remind you .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely not .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than having at all but it 's not at at at all , but it 's not a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magical value . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure we 've taken from a piece of the level , the level where the choices better our life .
Now , from political point of view -- I 've almost finished -- from political point of view , the political nocity .
What it allows you all this picture in industrial society is the material .
There are a lot of places in the world , and you know about it , where the problem is not they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too little bit of it .
So the face of the face that I 'm talking about is a sick of modern , recently , recently society .
And what it does have to get to the wear and is this : Steve Levitt talked about how much of those expensive and discovered seats for bombs are inuses . It 's a sprinkle of money .
I mean these choices , complicated and dispendispendious , it 's not just unuuseful .
They 're advanting of the .
They 're worse about .
If a little bit of what in our society allows that it 's been revered in those where people are too few possibilities , it would not only have their lives to improve , but also our own .
This is what economists call a paretian improvement .
A redistribution of the income is good to everybody -- not just to the poor the poor -- because of this choice , in a way that we go back .
To conclude , " You can become everything you want , "
You know , culture , you 'll think , " What do that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make anything in a glass of glass . "
" A imagination , a limited view of the world -- "
and I 'm interested in this , at the beginning .
But then , think , instead , I realized that the weavy knows the longer .
Because the reality of fact is , if you have to sent the boat , so that it 's possible " you don 't get freedom . You get the paralysis .
If you break the boat so that all divent can decrease .
Let me get the paralysis , and you 'll reduce the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too , maybe even for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the assumption of some symboard is a recipe for flection and , for roin the roin .
Thank you very much .
