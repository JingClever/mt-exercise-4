The last year I showed these slides to show that the glacial calculartics , which is almost three million years of the United States , the United States continental , it 's returns up 40 percent .
But it 's a gravity of the problem because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice because it doesn 't show the ice of the ice .
The artics calculartics is , in a certain sense , the critical heart of global climate system .
It 's wind and it 's ritive up .
The next slide is a fast carlated carlated on the last 25 years .
The ice perennerads are drawings in red .
As you see , they expanded up until the blue .
That 's the ice in the winter inverny , which is revernotion .
You can see that the ice cosidgn , along , five years or more , it 's like the blood , which is like the blood , which is like the blood .
In 25 years , it 's spent from so ,
This is a problem because the interest scale is the interest in the ocean , where there are huge amount of coal congeled that , scientists , they 're transformed in the microbes .
It turns out to the totality of the atmospect of global warming , that amount could be double , superperformed this point of not right .
In some deep in Alaska little deep in Alaska metano is already reboling on the water .
The professoresse Katey Walter of the University of Alaska , has rected with a team pressed up with a team .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : Wow ! You 're good . The question is if we 're also going to be us .
A reason is that this termal scenvironment from the North .
This is a glacial reme .
The ported never had reached laster .
This is the Kangerlussuaq , in the west west of the Greenland .
If you want to know how the level of the sea level of the ice to sea , here is where , it 's where it 's reaching it .
These corrings are increasing rapidly .
Another part of the planet : Antartttttttttarm of the planet .
The month , the scientists have dichiared that the balance of the ice is in negative , and that Antarctttartttttarttttttared , it 's particularly rapid in the slander .
It 's six feet of the hundred feet , like Greenland .
On Himalaya , the largest block of ice , you see new laghi , which few years ago were glaciers .
The 40 percent of the world population was half of the population population .
Sulle Ande : this ice is the source of the powerful water of this city .
The laugh is increased .
But when it diminies , the same happens to the water .
In California , the newspaper in California is diminuitous about 40 percent .
The hydrogen are in crisis .
You predictions , like you read , they 're graves .
The growth secity in the world leads to a remarkable car .
The disaster environmental disaster environmental and without precedental .
Four times more numerous times in the last 30 years , you know previous previous 75 .
This is a lot of all insustainable .
If you look at it in the stories if they can see the consequences .
In the last five years we 've added 70 million tons of CO2 every 24 hours -- 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look at the East area of the Eastern Pacific , from the American East , to the west , and both the west of the substites of the oxygen ocean .
The major causes of global warming , together to deforest , which is 20 percent , it 's use of fuels .
The oil is a problem , and coal is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions , together to China .
And it was to build a lot of other coal .
But we 're seeing a change of direction .
These are the annative projects in the last years and some projects alternative versus .
In the way , there 's a lot of political in our country .
The carbon industries and oil have spent 250 million dollars in the last year for promotion , which is a lit bone .
The picture I remember something --
I 'm Natale , in the Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion liters of carbon dioxes .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the biggest second flower scories in America .
It 's success around Natale .
The nature of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : Be , the carbon , it 's a kind of allegro and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it makes our economy .
Frosty carbon is more and more and more more more more and more .
It 's a good price , adorable and workers keep the stick stick .
Al Gore : From here is falling of the West Virginia .
The biggest mineraria society is Massey Coal . This is his amministrator . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : Al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Reid -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alleance for the Clima Protection has two campaiged up .
This is one of them , a part .
Video : Atches : ALergy see the climate change as a minaccording to our business .
For this priority is investment a great amount of money in a public public public to make public and confused truth and confused to the carbon .
In fact , the carbon is not sport .
We think it 's also a good profuse .
So not preocupateves of climate change .
Let me do you .
Video : Actor : Carbon : Carbon -- you 've heard a lot of talking about it .
So , you do a turn in a turn in a structure on the one , it 's about coal .
Stratraordinary ! The machines are a little rumorous , but this is the sound of the technology of the carbon technology .
The carbon consumption is between the main the main global warming , but the technology of carbon technology , but the fuels of the carbon bedded .
Do you look , this is the od-technology of coal .
Al Gore : At , the positive alternative connected to economic issues and the national security .
Video : Comvailing : The national security , the national security , the national crisis .
The challenge that all of us : our dependence from fossil fuels , like coal , and the important coal .
Now , although , there 's a new , car solution for use .
Repower America : 100 percent of it , in 10 years .
A plan to put America to work in the work , and make sure it , and help us stop global warming .
It was inally , a solution that basts to solve our problems .
Repower America . Scover more .
Al Gore : That 's the last .
Video : It 's about record : It 's about record to America .
One of the fast ways to bring us to the end of dependence on the combustic combustiable that killed our planet .
It 's the future is here . It 's here . It 's , a new energy , a new energy .
It 's worker for two : Noves investment for bad workers .
Comvast : Repower . It 's time to be realistic .
Al Gore : A wait : An African says , " If you want to go down to the fast , you go from solves .
If you want to go away , you go together . "
We have to go away away , fast .
Thank you very much .
The year at TED Fech , I did an introduction on the LHC .
And I promise to return to the nars on how the machine .
So , here , I did , and for those who there were no , the LHC is the largest scientific experiment ever -- 27 miles of circumstomer .
Her compassumption is to remember the conditions that were less than a billion on the beginning of the universe -- to 600 million times a second .
All of that is just environment .
This is the Ginevra under Ginevra .
We spent these mini-Big Big Big inside the remarkable .
This is what I work . It 's called ATLATLATLATLATLATLATLAs , it 's a 22 feet .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLATLAS in buildings .
10 tember last year we have accese , we have acceso the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was ununless festy in control .
It 's a picture of the first of particles that had done all the around of the LHC , both , both in collision , with a part of the LHC , and spread particles in the reator .
In other words , when we see that picture that picture 10 tember , we understand that machine machine , which is a great vicity .
I don 't know if it was this to be exultent more or this , when someone went on Google and saw the beginning this .
That means that we had a cultural impact beyond that scientific .
It was a week later , there was a problem with the machine , had to these damage here -- these dored drugs .
These files are 13,000 amps when the machine works at the massive machine .
Now , the technicians between you look at the children and say , " It 's not true . They 're too sound . "
And instead can do it because when they 're very cold slams are the cold slams .
So , at least 271 degrees , at a temperature in the space between the stars , these files can bring that corrent corrent .
In one of the Juntures of the most nailed magnetes in the LHC , there was a fect of fect-fect .
So the files surgery , and the 13,000 practices , and 13,000 practices meant .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnetes fish more than 20 tons , and that there were about 30 centimeters .
They 're damaged about 50 magnetets .
We had to take them , what we did .
We repristed it and it gets them .
Now , they 're returning all the place .
It 's the end of the LHC will be again .
We will accening , and we expect to get the right or light-juddle or , and keep so our adventure to discovered to discovered what the universe .
Now , of course , in a way , these accidents reaccess the dibate of the value and engineering in frontier . It 's easy to do it . It 's easy to confuture .
I think the fact that 's so difficult , the fact that 's so difficult , I think it 's value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a monke-up scientist Inglens , Humphrey Davy , which , I imagine , in the inutiles of the inutions of its own own pupille , his own pupille , he said , " Nithing is a lot of dangerous for the human remarkable to be that the ideas of science is not measurement , and that are not very much about our ideas , and that 's not a very good , and that 's not a total to be a new word .
Thank you .
I want to start to ask you to think about when you , da , you play with children , play with .
While you realize how to reach them and afferrate them , and learn it , and learned them , and learn to think , and they 're actually going to think and solve problems .
The patial reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand most part of the world around us .
So , from the information information is a use of our interaction with physical objects , and my conon Patts , and my collaborator , and my collaborator , I started asking up , " And when we use a computer , instead of having the only cursor of the digital poller , which is a digital cursor , we could have the physical information with the both of the digital hands ,
and sists it to our plony ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , built the answer , buildings .
In a few words , a Siftable , a Siften interactive , as a bircooker .
In a few words , a Siftable , a Siften interactive , as a bircooker .
He can move with her hand , they can see them in their hand , they can see the right and they have a radio and a radio radio radio screen .
But most physics , I 'm physics , like the morning , you can just move to simply fashion .
Siften Siften example of a new ecosystem for manipulate information .
And as they get more physical , consciously , the other , of the other , and as they become more physics , conscious , of the other , of how we move , we can explore new and different kinds of interaction .
I 'm going to do with some simple example .
This Siften is conffigurate to show of the video : if you including it in a direction , the video race so , if you 're going to go back .
These interactive reactive of the other people .
If you 're interests , they 're interested in what they 're going around .
If they 're surrounded , and they can act a little bit .
If they 're surrounded , and they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
We then realized that one of the interesting implications of interaction was the power to use the fundamental gestyliquid , for example , " a liquid . "
In this case , we have three Siftable conflict like secks of the true and I can use them to advice in the central , where they miss .
and I can use them to the color in that central , where they miss .
If we 're too , we can put a little bit in place .
You also see the beautiful chance of approvide , like languages , and yoks of logic and logical games where people can try things fast , and see the results the immediately results .
I 'm going to do --
This is a Fibonacks that I do with a equations .
Here we have a word of words that 's half in Scarabeo and Boggle .
Pratically , every turn a letter to every Siften , in Pratically , at all Siften , at every turn in a case on every Siftable , and while you try and understand who he 's certainly control he 's on a diptionary .
Then , after about 30 seconds , they 're remiss , and you have a new set of lectal lectal and possibility to try .
Thank you .
Here 's children came in the Media Lab , I did it and put them and I did it and tried them a video .
They were very much .
And one of the interesting things about this application is that you don 't have to give people many education .
You just say , " What about the words , " and they know , and they know what to do .
Here 's the other people who try it .
This is our younger head , there on the right .
It actually wanted to just impilate them .
They were only morning , for him .
Now , this is a conversation of a interactive application .
We wanted to build a tool for the apprint of the languages .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving the Siften , solid Siften .
It can insert new characters in the scene , solving the Siften , solid Siften .
Here 's , it 's doing it .
Video : The sun is .
David Merrill : Now he took a tractor in the scene .
Video : The arange treator .
Bel ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes ! Yes .
So I school at Siftable and put up close , and put it can interact the characters --
Video : Bau !
and , inventing your story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It 's a final story with the end , and it can decide him how it blew .
DM : It 's a final story with the end , and it can decide him how it blew .
Video : Vols , guns .
DM : The last example I have the time to show you is a tool , realized of it , to figure , to figure and execting music .
it 's a tool , recently , to fix and exef music .
Siftable here are agism , basically , and the bacteria .
Each one of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
You can also do these sound in a sequence from a sequence to your feet .
And it just fairly to make a sound and a sequence . "
These are actually that you can control from the vive , like the reverbs and the filter .
The one is particular , and then including it .
And then there are the general effects like time and fly , and you applate to the whole sequence .
Let 's look like it works .
Video : DM : We 're going to put a base in two Siftable , " sequence " , " We 're going to do the other base .
Now I put a basis of based .
Video : DM : Now I add some percussions --
Video : And now I 'm going to put the bacteria , so I can control the effect from the vive .
Video : DM : DM : I can fast the whole sequence inclinking the time from one or another .
Video : And I 'm going to add the filter to the bottom to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can recombine the sequence " to the flight . "
So I didn 't have to plan it first , but I can improvising it , it realizing it , or more cord .
And now , finally , I can fump the whole sequence inclinking on the left Siftable . "
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is to build new interface , and more more more more more than our brain and cording to how our brain and corbody .
And today , I 've been time to show you one of the results of this lost , and also some possibility that we try to bring out from the lab .
The concept I want to spend is that there 's a new generation of objects designed to interact with the digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
They 're a writing .
I 'm going to critical books is more than that , of course .
It 's also love and the faascine of my life .
And I don 't expect that I can change .
But , I said , something particular happened in my life and my career , and in my meat that , who took me to remember the whole job with this .
The particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called Mangry , Prega , Ama , " which , diversity of books , for some reason , and it turns out in the world and become a big sensationship , and became a big sensationship .
And the result is that everywhere now , people treat me as if I was condanned .
Do -- condanned , condanned .
They don 't have to be now about it and say , " Don 't you get no fear more ?
You don 't have to be able to keep up for all life without power to create a book that can important book to create a book that can important one book ? "
that can be important to someone ? "
It 's rasing , you know .
But it could go to the worse , I remember that more 20 years ago , when I started to say , I was a adolescent adolescent -- I wanted to be a writh .
I walked up to the same as the fear .
And people said , " Don 't be able to be able to success ?
Don 't you fear that the umiliation of killed ?
Don 't you fear the fear of all life without nothing that nothing is ever outside and dead on a standle of dreams with the damage of damage with the damage of failure ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short answer to all these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I fear about all those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also fear a lot of other things that people could not have to do .
As the algap and other things .
But , for how about the writing that I thought and I was asked , and I would ask me , and I would ask me ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone who has been wait to be spent by a work that you 've been bored to do .
But what 's there so particular in the creative impress to make us nervous about health mental health in a way that other careers do they do ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemistry and I don 't remember a only in the 40 years of activity in which was asked if she was asked if she had fear to be engineer ?
Never -- that block of the John , how would it do ?
Don 't work like this , you know ?
Onesturs , the engineers as group don 't certainly , in the secoli , driven reputation of being alcolized .
Nowriters , we have a pretty reputation , and not just the creative reputation , but creative reputation of being huge mentally instable mentally .
And it 's not the other thing that looks at the sad of the magnificments of the magnificments that , only in the 20th century , they died young and often for them .
And also the ones that they don 't have suicidirect from their dons .
Norman Mailer , before I die in the last interview said , " Onnnday my book has been killed a little more . " A extraordinary affermation about their life .
But we don 't bley when we feel about saying because we heard these things , so long that in some way we 've been completely interior , and accepted the notion that creativity and the art are some way and art , it 's going to be a little bit of launch and art , it will always be in the angooddddly , it will be able .
And the question I want to all the time is : You 're accord with this idea ?
You know , it 's really -- because it also looks at a hundred distance to me not good for anything this supposed .
I think it 's odiose .
And I think it 's even dangerous and I don 't want to see perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better encourage our big creative minds .
And I 'm sure that , in my case -- in my situation -- it would be very dangerous to start fire to the heart of supposed , especially dries the circumstances in which I 'm in my career .
It 's really -- involved , I 'm pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I 've been about 40 years .
I have about four decades of work in me .
And it 's very likely that anything write right now , it will be judged by the world as the work that was done after my last book .
I 'm going to be slavery , because we 're all likely , that my greatest success is to my huge .
Oh , Gesus , who thought .
You know this is the kind of thinking about that leads a person to start gin the nine of the nine and I don 't want to do it .
I would keep to keep doing this work that we do .
So , the question becomes , how ?
And so so it looks , after many reflection , that the way to work to keep write is to create a psychological costruction , right ?
I have to find a security of security between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural anxy-up , which is going to wrote . And , as I was trying to all the time , and I was looking at all through the time , looking through the time , looking through the time , looking through the time , looking at the time , looking through the time , looking through the time , looking through the time , and I 'm saying other society .
to help people to help creative people to get the inerent inerents of the creativity .
And that research took me to the old Great and antician .
Seguitem because it gets back in cercle and then back .
Nelt the Great and ancient -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity came from from men , OK ?
It was thinking about it was the creativity is the spirit of them , and that came to the men from one of some surprising and unknown , for reasons and known , for reasons and discovered .
The green record these spirits are the demen of the demons . "
Socrate , wonderful , credemon have a demon that elargives from the far away from the far away .
The Romanes were the same idea , but they called that kind of spirit without a genius .
The huge , because Romani didn 't really think a genius was someone particularly smart .
They have to be a genius was this kind of devate that created literally lived in literally in the walls of a artist , a little bit like the elfter Dobby , and that came out of the arten of the arten job and to the result of the arten of that work .
It 's a deal -- that 's the distance of which I talk about -- that that psychological costruck you from your work .
And everybody knew that was how it worked , right ?
So the antiwho were protected by certain things , like the too narcicism , as we 're going to be too much , no ?
If your work was except , it was exceptional , they all know that they had been helped by this genius .
If your failure , it wasn 't all your job , right ?
They all knew that was your genius to be a inable .
So people han concept the creativity in the Occident for a long time .
Then the Renascivvvvent came and it changed , and nacked this big idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe and mists and more and without more leaving space for the devity .
This was the major of humanesimum and people started thinking that creativity came to completely thinking that creativity came to completely hydivide .
And for the first time in the history , you start to referred this or that article like a rather that one person with the genius .
And I have to tell you , I think that was a big herror .
I think I hope to someone , a simple person to believe as a recipient as the source , the essence and the sign of all the divins , inosconstructed and a responsibility of a too big responsibility .
It 's like to ask someone to ingoal .
Deform and it completely the ego and creates all of these inextremely expectations on performance .
And I think that was this pression to destroyed the artists in the past 500 years .
And , if that 's true , and I think it 's , the question becomes , and now ?
Can we do it fun ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and mistery .
Or maybe not .
Maybe we can 't cancer 500 years of thinking in a talk about 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people in the audience that sollevered to the scientific notion , insom , insom that they follow people to get them or failed their own designs .
You know , I 'm not going to convince all this thing .
But the question I want to ask is -- why not ?
Why not think that way ?
Because it has more sense of anything that ever ever heard to explain the exaspering exasperforms of the creative process .
A process , as anyone who ever ever ever tented to do something -- so , all here , basically , everybody here -- it doesn 't understand , you know , you know , you don 't buy .
And , in fact , it can sometimes completely paranormal .
I did this meet recently with the extraordinary poetesse Ruth Stone , who 's now 90 years , but it was a poetesse for all life and told me he said he was a poetesh for all life and tells it in the writing field , and he was in the field , and he was in the poem .
He said , he said that was like a broken air treno .
And that was rotate to her from the landscape .
It was going to be , because he was so much to do it under his feet .
He knew to have a only thing to do at that point and it was , and she was , " run like a matter . "
And so it turns out to home and come back from this poem , and wouldn 't have to make a piece of card and a bad enough , and a fairly , and it 's pretty quickly , and she gets it on the page .
As not quite fast , it was pretty fast , so it goes and correct out of it and the poem and the poem and he was poem and she would keep up through the landscape , and he would keep up up through the landscape , and he said , " one other poet . "
Then there were those times -- this piece of a piece of time -- there were some moments where it was almost losing losing , right ?
So , he was high hundred and was trying to the card and the poem was on the way , and he was going to a walk in the way , and then he said , he was like , and then he said , he said , he was like you sleep with the other hand and the wackle .
He was the poem in the code and reput it in his body and turned it in his body and turn on the page .
And in these cases , the poem was presented on perfect page and inter , but the last word at the first word .
So when I felt it -- it 's a crazy , it 's exactly equal to my creative process .
Not my creative process -- I 'm not a condition .
I 'm a mula , and my way to work is ; you wake up at the same time every day and I 'm going to work and go and pass and pass us .
But even I , in my head , I have a sharage , I 've distriked against that thing , sometimes .
And I think that also a lot of you have done .
You know , even if the work and ideas came to me from a certain source , I could not be honestly .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relationship to it out , but , rather , rather , but , rather , rather , that make us remain it ?
For how I look at me , the best example of the Tom Waits , I have a Tom Waits , which I interview is different years ago for a day .
We were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life has been the incarnation of the article of the artist recorded , trying to control these species of creative impulses .
But then I invent , he calculus , and a day as he was driving on a authos in Los Angeles , he changed all for him .
He was going to go fast and all of a sent tracks , this little bit of melody , which is reverse in his head , and it wants , and it wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and it wants , but it 's not as it .
It 's not a piece of card , not a matter , it has a recording .
So he started to feel this kind of old species , and he 's growing it , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm going to lose , and I 'll be obsessed by this song .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do good and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , it stops .
I 'm going to put the whole mental process and he did something completely new .
I 'm going to just the sky and said , " Scususes , " Scuses , not see I driving ? "
" You know , " Do you know a song now ?
If you really want to exists , you 're going to be a little bit more opports one when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , you 're going to do anything else today .
You go to disturba Leonard Cohen . "
And his work , he was changed after this .
Not the work , the work was still knowledge as a always .
But the process , and the fish anxide that was recorded when the genius , the genius that was caused when the genius , he was going to go back to where it comes , and he remaining it back where , and he was doing it .
but it gave this peculiar , wonderful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange and this strange , and external thing .
So as the felt that story is also changing a little bit of the way I work and already on me once .
This idea , I save me when I was writing " Manogy , Prega , and cave in one of those cave that we 're working on something and we can 't start thinking that we 're working on something and start thinking that we 're working on something and we can 't start thinking that it will be a disaster , which is the worse book .
Not only bad , just the worst book book .
And I started thinking about gectaring this project .
But then I remember Tom who talked about the air and try .
So , you know , my face in the manttouch and deresses my common in the writing corner of the room .
And I said , " Sents , " Sents , what , you both know that if this book not be brilliant , not be a bright , not be a lot of my , no ?
Because as you see , I 'm put all I 'm going to do not more than that .
So if you want you to be better , you have to present your part and make your part .
Okay . But if you don 't do it , you know what , I don 't do .
I 'm going to writing the same because my work .
And I want to do for favor that I 've been presented to me to do my part . " Because , finally , OK , it 's so , OK -- secoli ago , OK -- secoli ago , OK -- saying , OK , and sacred for the dances of the key , dances and music and hours and hours and hours and hours to the ala .
And they were always magnific , because the ballerini were professionals and were fantastic .
But every long , rarely , something happened , and one of these arts was actually transendent reality .
And I know what I talk about , because I know you 've seen it , at a certain point , a performance so .
It was like the time it stops , and the ballerin the walking through a kind of bral bral , and wasn 't doing anything else from the usually , but all of it was sitting .
And in suddenly not a human .
But it turns out from the divinside and under the fuoh of divinity .
And when this happened , you have to the time , people knew what was , they called her his name .
They were drive hands and started cantaring , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God . "
That 's God , you know .
Curious note stories -- when the Morinvader the Spain , took this abitude with them and the pronunce changed in the secoli to " Allah , Allah , " in " Allah , " the rules , " which , " which is , " that , " which is , " that you can hear in the corride .
In Span , when a arten did something impossible and magical , " Allah , words , " Allah , " I was , " uncomprehensible , " I walk up , " I scorce God .
And it 's great because we need .
But , the problem is the day after , for the ballerin the wake , when you wake up and discovered that I 'm the 11 morning and the God doesn 't there .
It 's just a mortal with gran to the ginoccurred , and maybe it will never be able to make that altitude .
And perhaps nobody will be the name of God still while it 's going to do with the rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most sweet to make in a creative life .
But perhaps not have to be so angos-like , if you can 't believe , the most extraordinary aspects of your being being from yourself .
But you just think it 's just going to be data in prested by a source of this squisite part of your life that you have to go to someone else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think it all this way .
And so I started thinking , and it 's sure , and it 's certainly as I thought for different months in the work of the book that I 'm going to published , spent , spent , spent , spent , I was going to follow my grandscape .
And what I have to keep up to tell me when I feel elected by this is , not having .
Not to go . It 's just your work .
Continua presenter for your part , any could be .
If your work is balance , balance .
If the divine , I liked up to leave some kind of wonderful kind of wonderful , for one moment through your swine , only through your swine , then , " On ! "
Otherwise , you do the same thing .
And " Ole ! " You know , " On it . "
I think I think it 's about it .
" On it ! " to you know , only for having love human love and head and head tal tal tal humans to get you to present you continuously .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : On !
As you know , I 've been talking about some of these designs on the human genome , what can mean and discovery of new set of genes .
Now we 're beginning a new way : we started digitalize biology and now to start to the biology and now start to the digital code , we 're going to make a new biology of biology , design and sintetizing .
We 've always been trying to bring big questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists I think they have tented to understand vary .
We tried different approaches , reduced to the third terms .
We 're digitalizing from almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was treated to spend from the analooome of the biology in the digital world .
Now , let 's ask us : Could you regenerate life , or create new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a little organism , the Mycoplasma genitalium , which is the species of the little bit more than the one that can authorem in the lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome to create a little more little bit more .
We 're able to do a hundred genes of the 500 of about 500 that I am here .
But when we look at his metabolic maps , it 's relatively simple respect to our .
I think , that 's simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at the time , it 's very unliving to a living cells .
So we decided that the only way to progrew was synthesize this cromosom in way to bring some of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of the Point of the People know ? "
It can be able to make these big molecules that we never able to create these big molecules that we never able to create before ?
And , in case , we can make a cromosom ?
A cromosom is just a piece of chemistry material .
The speed with which we are able to digitalize life is growing exponential exponential .
Our ability to write the genetic code , instead , rather , it is better .
And our most recent recently recently the bring on a exponential curve .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process process has require a lot of past bioetics before we began with a bioetics before we began .
But we found out that DNA is very difficult .
There are tens of thousands of machines of DNA , the longer segments of 30 to 50 to 50 lectal , and it 's a degenerative process : the longer segment is a longer degenerative process , there are a longer , there are a lot of herrors of DNA ,
So we had to develop a new method to assemble these framments and correct the errors .
And this was our first tentative , to start to start digital information from the genome of Phi X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills kills .
We designed the fragments , effected the correction of errors and get a molecule of DNA of about 5,000 lectal .
The interesting part is when we took this piece of a chemistry of chemist and we put it into the bacteria , the bacteria have started read this genetic code and produce particles .
The viral particles have been releft from cells , are back and they disted it back and have destroyed the Ecoli .
I talked about the recent industry oil membraning that they have certainly compressed this model .
They have more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where software can really build the same hardware can actually build the same hardware in a biological system .
But we wanted to do things in a lot of things .
We wanted to build the whole cromosom of the bacteria .
They are more than 80 mila lettle of genetic code .
So we thought we build it in the seven of the virus of the virus , so that we could change the cassed of the components of a living cells .
The design design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequence this genome for the first time in 1995 , accuratess was a herror for every 10 mies .
We discovered , 30 herrors . If we used that original sequence . If we used that original sequence of it .
A part of the process process is designing segments that have subjective segments to all the other segments of 50 lectal segments to build little little little bit more than working together .
We try to do the only one here .
You know , you know , you know that we put the physical figure .
Think of it , we have a genetic code on four lectal , C , C , God and T.
Three of those letters together with them together with about 20 minoacids , and there 's a specific order to each amminoes .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , framework , frures .
What we did about it was self-fashion .
Some of them were in the fact that it wasn 't a poem .
We designed these segments to just just une with it .
There are them to repeat them and put them together .
And we started to assemble parts , beginning with seven to seven , and they sell it up with segments , unending it to form segments of 24 mila lt-hundred mila to get 72 mies .
So , we have these sequence in abundance so that we 're trying to create a very squence that we 're trying to create a extremely robustood -- like you 'll see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatizing the process .
So , this seems the tabellon a basket .
When we get these very long , we get these very long , more than 100 mila , more than 100 mila , they 're not going to be directly in the Ecoli .
It comes to the modern of the modern biology .
So we 've been considered to other mechanisms .
We had another mechanism called the omologa , which in biology , which in biology to use the DNA can use segments to repair the DNA could une segments .
Here 's a example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radioduring , can absorbed three million rad .
You can see in the superior like his cromosom beyond .
In 12 hours , it was reassembled exactly as it was before .
There are thousands of organisms that are able to do it .
These organisms can be completely seck .
They can live under vacuum .
They 're absolutely certain that life exists in space , and you feel to find new environments of water .
ASA , NASA showed that this happens .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built these processes , just using these processes , just using the lists with the segments of segments to insert .
The lists above it .
This picture was not taken with a microscope , but with a microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It 's a molecule that we can see it with a microscope with a microscope .
These are pictures that they have a period of about six seconds .
This is the publishing that we did a little time .
They are more than 80,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of a definitely defined by the man .
It 's a molecular weight to 300 million .
If we stop it with a caratter 10 without spaces , there would like 142 pages , you just to transforming this genetic code .
Now , how do we work ? How can we do it ?
Of course , it 's a virus from a young boys .
It 's a little more complicated when they use the bacteria .
It 's even as simpler when it 's the eucariote as our : you can just extremely extractly the nucleo and insert another , which is basically the clonation of clonation .
In the bacteria , the bacteria is instead of integrated inside the cells , but we have recently demonstrated that we are able to make a transplant of a cell of cell to another activity .
We can refed a cromosom from a microbial species .
The two different are as the men from the opi .
We have add some genes in more way to decide what choose to choose for this cromosom .
The sciolden with the way to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cells was stupendownsticking -- and you know our sophisticatoos -- the new cromosom was going to cell .
And we started thinking that we couldn 't go beyond , but we tried to spend more in the there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We 've found that many of a second or a third or a third cromosom from a lot of hundred new tracks of the tracks to that species .
So who think about evolution as only gene to evolution as a gene at the time that it doesn 't understand the biology .
There are the encies called " restription " that advanty digery , they 're going to digit .
The cromosom that was in the cells don 't have a chance .
The mobile phone that we have inserit----------------------cell cell cell cell .
It 's expressed , and recognize the other cromosom as expressed material , and we returned it with only the cells and the new cromosom .
it became became cause of the genes that we 've insered .
And in a short time , all the characteristics of a species , and it turned out of it , and it turned out in a new species , based on the new software that we inserious in the cells .
All the proteins are changed , membranes are changed , and when we read the genetic code of the equival code what we 've been transfer .
Now , this could seem alchemy genetics , but it 's altering the software , but it 's pretty such a pretty such substantial .
Now , I 've been explained that here doesn 't talk about the genesis -- but I 'm going to start three million years and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of the Cambrian where they will be a new species on this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's pretty obvious when we think about our needs .
We 're going to spend six billion in the next 40 years .
Just for example , I was born in 1946 .
Now , there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 , there will be four .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and cleaning , and wells and benzine for six billion and a half billion people .
It 's even more drawings to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion carbon carbon , more than 30 billion baries of oil .
That means millions of baries a day .
When we try to find biological process , or whatever of the process of reduced to reduce them , it will be a huge challenge .
We have to hold all of the CO2 emission of these materials that end up the atmosphere .
At the day , because of scientific discovered in the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that are the designed for the future .
The electronic industry , only only only a dozen about components , and think about how many different things came out .
Our limits here is a major biological data and our imagination .
Now we have the techniques , because these metods of rapid synthetization , able to create what we call fighting genomics .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million cromosomes a million cromosomes a day .
Think of them , you think about the different genes or to try to get optimizing the processes to produce either opten , new vaccines , and we can change , thank more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology , and create more biology .
And it 's just a standard .
We can choose for a living of survival , production , chemistry or fuel , production of the etc or fuels .
This is an instantanoown-program program that we 're working for being able to be able to seat and design species .
Well , we don 't necessarily know how they will be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
Now we 're concentrate on the fuel of the generation of it generation .
You saw you saw it out of the etanol from gray was a finished experiment .
We have a lot of second and third generation that will be surrounds of fuels to be able to be as a opping or different butanol .
But the only way the biology can have a great impact without increasing without increasing more than the cost of food and limitate the disponable to be transforming CO2 in matter , where we 're working for designing cells that can reach this discovered , and we think we could have this discovered , and we think of power this discovered , and we think of that are the first coaling about 18 months .
The solar light sunlight -- but in our discoveries -- but in our discoveries in our world , we found different metods .
This is a organism that we described in 1996 .
It 's about 2500 feet , about 2500 feet deep in the temperature of the water .
They reat the CO2 molecular , using hydrogen molecular energy .
We 're trying to understand whether we can indownnnice CO2 , which can be translated by your mind , to drive that CO2 in carbon , to drive this process .
So , we think we could be able to increasing what we could be able to increasing what is life is Noooil , vertising -- we have the goal to reverse the whole industry . We have the goal to reducies .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where can ?
It would be a main source of energy .
It 's also working on for using the same metods to create vaccinistant .
You saw this year with the influence , we 're always back in a year and with a dollar in less when it 's tracks .
I think that you can change fighting with fighting in a lot of them .
Here 's how the future could start seemch , now , the tree of evolution , accelerating evolution with bacteria , and finally , and you end up with the eucariote .
We 're so much as the best people .
Our discovers is to be able to live enough to try to make it . Thank you very much .
First of all I 'm going to show you , the most rapidly possible , some fundamental work , which we took to Microsoft in the following a year ago exactly a year ago exactly . This is Seadragon . That 's Seadragon .
It 's a environment that you can interact with a huge amount of data .
Here we 're seeing a lot of digital gabyte pictures with a kind of zoom with a kind of photos , and for a quick fast , disponing , disponing the images as we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big amount of information that we see , how big these are collectors or the images of data or the images .
Most of the digital photographs , but this for example is a provent scanning from the Biiiood-year-old , and it reentered in the gamm of 300 megapixel .
Not any difference because the only thing that limits the prestations of a system like this is the number of player on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a book book , example of data not images .
This is the Dickens . Each colonna represent a chapter .
For show you that it 's just about the text and not images , we can do something like that , to make a real thing of this , to make that it 's a real representation of the text , not a picture of the text , not a picture of the text , not a picture of the text , you can do something like that , to make a real photographs , you can do something of that , to be a real thing of the way of that , to be a real .
It could be a little artificial way to read a book .
Not it .
This is a more realistic example . It 's a number of the West .
Each picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the pleasure and the beautiful version of the version of a revision or a quotidian , which is for nature , for nature a molt-half .
We also have done something with the corner of this particular number of the Guardian .
We created a fasules in higher resptioner -- much more higher than that you use in a normal published -- and we insered you of the content .
If you want to see the characterists of this author , you can see here .
Or other model , or even the specific techniques .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate the limits of space on screen .
We hope that means to put it up , and the other portrait and other portrait , and other portrait , not should be necessary .
Naturally , the maps is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And on this not lose , if you don 't know , if we don 't have to say that we have the contributes in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States . It was a geospacal picture of NASA .
So now we 're going to do something else .
This is actually the view of the Web ; you can go to the web ; you can go to see it .
It 's a project called Photosynth , which combine two different technologies .
A is Seadragon and the other is a visual research computing very interesting research by Noah Snavah , a student of the University of Washington , with Steve Seitz of the U.S. . . Trentch , " A optim . " It 's a very optic research .
And it 's from Seb , gests from Seadragon .
You can see it when we do this kind of screen , where we can go from an image to another and have this kind of multiple resolution .
But the space space is actually a meaning here has effectively meaning .
The algorithms of visualization computers have recorded these images together , so that correspond to the place that the pictures -- all of the nearly pictures that the picture -- all of the nearly recorded -- they 're taken . So , you 're taken . So you can see elements of a slide show show . So , and these things are all colleagues . And these things are all the things that are all the connected .
I don 't know if I 've been going to show you some other environment .
There are some more spacal .
I want to go directly one of the original data data . And this is from a previous prototype of Phototype of Phototype that we did for the first time the first time the scortextes , to show you what the glave this technology , the Photosynth , the technology Photosympth . And it 's not necessarily reverse , and it 's not necessarily reverly .
We had to worry about the laws and foreign wait and forward .
This is a rebuild the Notre Dame of Notre Dame pictures from Flickr . Baast digitar . Baast , and you get images of the types in the maglies , other campus , and so on . On one of these arancions in the wind of these arancions representing a picture that it 's discovery .
So , they 're all pictures from Flickr and were all all connected to this way .
And it 's possible to navigate this way simple .
You know , I never thought about it finally , I 've never thought about it for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying this kind of according here .
I think you can see that it 's a lot of different kinds of different kinds of photocameras : from those of the phones in the SLR , a meaning number of meaning , put together in this environment .
And if I can do that , I try to try to look at those strange .
Many of you have been touch by easy , etc .
As some part here is a series of photographs -- old .
This is a Notre Dame recorded correctly correctly .
We can go from the physics of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is taking data from the entire memory of how the land looks like the land , from visual visual -- and college all of these data .
All those pictures become , more than the som of the som of the parts .
You have a model of the land that emerging .
Think about this as a prolungment of Stephen Lawler on Earth .
It 's something that grow in complexity as people use it , and the people that are use for the author to increase use it .
Their picture are brand with them inseres from other people .
If someone is the idea of the idea of these sells saying the name , my photo of Notre Dame improvisely , you get to get a lot of all of these data , and I can use as a medings of all of these data , and I can use as a photographs of everyone else , using photographs of everyone else , and have a red experience of cross-mode in red , and have a red experience of red red red red red red red red red ,
Of course , a consequence of this virtual model of virtual model of all interesting , collected in the land , you wouldn 't just likely to airplane and satellitarian and similes , but from the consequence .
Mille .
Chris Anderson : I realized ? What your software there going to be able to do is that a certain point , in the next few years , all the photographs , all the photographs in the whole world will be collected together ?
BAA : Yeah . What 's doing is basically discover .
It 's creating hyperlink , if you want , you , between images .
And it 's doing it in the basis to the content of the images .
The thing becomes very interesting if you think about the remember of security security of these images that many of these images are able .
As when you do a research of pictures on the Web , and the text on the Web page has a lot of information about the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the pictures of the photo .
Now , what if that 's going on to all your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection and semantical and the amount of recognize that is really huge . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really incredible .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the main pilevers when you travels and one of the research of the ethnographics , is the power of living in the wind , between who have the past , the touch in the wind , the touch in the piece of the plants .
Basti thinking that sciamani Jaguar travel even beyond the Lattea , or that the mites of the Inuit are still a meaning , or Himalaya , the good dests in Dharm , to remember the important thing of the Dharm , to remember the important important thing about the central anthropology , and that the idea that the world we live in exist , but it 's just a really a model ,
the consequence of a particular set of choices that our stryes done , well or mal , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracks .
All we do all . We 're going to do .
We are subjects to return .
We need to deal with the inesorability of death , so it doesn 't surprised us if we 're going to be able to be .
We all have a art .
What color is the particular , the particular of the song , the rural of every culture .
Not matter that they are the thinking of the Borneo , or the following Vodoo , or the Haiti , or the wild the Kaisut in Kenya sectriers , or a nap in Kenya , or a wander in the heart of Sahara .
He was my journey in journey in the desert a month ago , or a high of yak , or a yak in the Everest , demother 's demother of the world .
All of these populations teachers are other ways of existing other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of display in the world .
And , if you reflect a moment , it 's a concept that can give you hope .
Insian , put myriades of cultures the world creating a spiritual life and cultual that we wanted the planet and it 's important for the benefit of the planet as the ragela biological ragela .
And you can think about this cultural ragela cultural ethnossphere and you can call the som the total ethnosfhere , inspiration , ideas , inspirations , inspirations , inspirations , inspiration , inspiration , inspiration , inspiring ,
The ethnossphere is the patrimonio of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be in the kind of inquisitive .
And sure as the biosphere was a lot of it happened to the ethnosfhere and purpose too much more .
Nothing is , for example , it would say that 50 percent of all species was or is on the oref the extinction of the simply apart , or the most apocaltical -- in the most apocaltical field -- and you don 't even close close close to the most optimistic of the diversity of the diversity .
The intells of all that is , of course , the languistic ,
When you 're born there was 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only from a vocabulary or from a gap , or a series of rules .
A language of the human spirit .
It 's the half a which animal of every culture is in the material world .
Every language of mind , a longer , a little bit of mind , a spiritual ecosystem .
And of those 6,000 languages , while we 're sitting in Monterey , at least half of the children is not more supply in the ears .
Not more teached to children , the who means , unless you can 't walk , unless than wasn 't .
What 's more sad than the silent of the silence , the last to talk to a language , not to have a language , not way to transmit the blue of the promise of the children ?
This orring was the state of someone in the world every two weeks : every two weeks : every two weeks , a moment and bring with it in the ulattakes in the ulattakes the ulattakes in a ancient language .
And I know someone who will say , " Don 't it ?
The world would not be better place if we talk all the same language ? " Bensim , then we talk all yorunothing . We talk about saying cantonese .
Let 's talk about kogs .
You 'll cover a tract thing to say that you couldn 't talk about your language .
Today I would like to do a journey through the ethnossphere --
a little journey in the ethnosfhere to give you a assage of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of existing existing really different ways of existing existing .
We take for example , this baby Barasana , in Amazonia sector , the popular of anacony , which creds the myth of the west latte walls of the latte of the saces of the sacred latte of the swest sacred .
It 's a popular popular popular , which is not to be the blue color because the green cell green , because it 's hidentified in the time , which depending on the forest .
They have a strange language and a mathematical rules , details " " " " " Did you have to feel a different language .
All of this radical past , yet the particularity is that in these families that are in these families that are talking about six or seven languages , because of the mathematicians , nobody basically a language .
They 're limited to listen and then start talking about .
We take one of the most interesting tribe about which I visited , the Waorani Waorani , the Waorani , a incredible popular popular that had the first contacts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionary , they have a common intedly a factor .
They did it up on the top photographs were in a populse that were in a popular population , forest that this population population had never seen anything about bi-dimensional bi-dimensional bi-dimensional bi-dimensional status .
They collected the picture of the land , they turn it to the research of a or a figure and , not find nothing , they 've been returned out that they were treated the distry , and they killed the five missionaries .
But the Waorani doesn 't only killed the straneors .
They killed to them in their own .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by the same .
We 're sitting at eight generations and we found two natural cases and we found two natural death , and when we 've been admed to know , they added it , and then they killed it , and then killed it the same . [ Risate ] ] As , every way , they had a knowledge of the forest forest .
The crawings were able to recognize the animal from 40 pass and recognize it .
In the early ' 80s , I was assigned a really interesting task when my Harvard , I asked me if I wanted to go to Haiti in the secrete truly secrete in the secrete of the Duvalier and Tonton Macoutes , and impossessing me to do the zombie .
To make sense of a sense of miraces , I had to understand the Vodoun culture and that Vodoo not magnership .
It 's pretty much of a complex measured vision of the world .
Man interesting thing .
If I asked you to tell me about the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Cristianesimum , Islam , Budaism , etc .
A continent continent is always left out , thinking that sub-Saharan Africa has a failed religious . And instead of , he did not else , and the Voooodoo not the distilled of these religious concepts of these religious concepts of the tragic concepts .
What makes the interesting voodom is the intense of life and death .
So , you 're going to hidden the spirits .
The spirits can be invocated by the Great the Great the rhythm and replace in the dance and they replace in the anim of the vive way that for a short became .
For this voodooists are going to say , " You know , " God talk about .
We say , we say in the temple and divention the time and diventire .
And the moment you 're going to tell you that you , is the spirit that you can do the myself ?
So you 're going to these incredible events : following voodoo in the state of trance that touch in the body that touch a rather demonstration rather than the power of mind on the body when it 's catalyzed in a state of extreme .
In all the popular popular populers with the most extraordinary of the Kogi Sierra Nevada , in Colombia , in Colombia sectrional sector .
It 's an antasy civilization that once they live on the path planets of Colombia in attention , the population was in the popular massive , they were revenue on the maining makes .
In a macchieving , this popular , this popular never been conquered by the spages .
At today , they 're government from a clero , but their formation is decided .
The young people following out from the family , three or four years , and they live secreated in a world fact of good and homs and homs in the base of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of the ice of 18 years .
Two periods of nine years to reduce the nine of the nine months of gestation that translate in the mother of the mother , now are metaphorically in the Great Mther .
So , for all this time , they get accultural values , values that they predicts their predict and only their preghious and only their preghious cost -- or to say the equilibrium or for the equilibrium .
At termines of this incredible beginning , they 're improvisely , and the first time in their age , in 18 years , in 18 years , they see a high-year-old . And in that accouncil of the first wrong , when the sun is the sun of beautiful , everything that they learned in the beautiful , everything they learned in the splay , all of what they learned in it is a past . The predict does a past ,
" Visto ? I 'm going to do you .
It 's stupend . It 's now to you protect it . "
They call them biggest fratels and they say that we , fratels minors , we are the colputs of the world .
This is extremely important .
When we think the ingenes and the environment and invote Rolseau and the old story of the noble story of the noble noble , which is a razctist in his simplicity or perhaps and say that we say these populations are closer to the Earth .
The popular popular indebulites are not indebolites from nostalogy .
There 's no space for these things in the disease in the disease or the gelids of the Tibet , but because of the time and riti , they created a mystics of the Earth , created a mystics of the Earth 's not on the concept of being knowledge that the Earth can live in the consciousness that the Earth can live in the consciousness of human consciousness .
What does it mean ?
It means that a little bit of Ande that the Ande that the world-grow mountain , and it will be a spirit of the human destiny , it will be a very different human destiny and it will have a different relationship with the mountain or that place in Montana , and that 's a little bit of Montana who 's a little rocks at at the Montana , and you have a little bit of being swap .
That 's the dimora of a mineral or a mineral ceasy is .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the report between individual and the natural world .
I grew up in the forest of Columbia Britannic Britannoic forests serves for being wrong .
And what I realized a human being from my Kwakiutl that believe that the forest proach that the forest proach that the Hukukuk and the stories of Hukukukuk and the spirits that live in the forest in the world , explaining the extreme of Hamately .
If you start to consider that these cultures can create different reality , you can start understand some of their sensitive sensitive discoveries . We make this plant .
I 've been taken this picture to open in the nordoctor .
Maybe some of you have heard about the ayahuasks , the most powerful such repertoilet 's science .
What makes the ayahuashuasis not the potential to the physics , but his elaboration . It 's the elected . It 's about two elements .
He 's a landhand , this lah lab that contains a series of a series of a bunch , a moline , slightly hologiene .
Take the only plants on the plants , you have a blue that alters a little bit the consciousness , but it 's mixed with the leaves of a family of the Psyotridis .
This is a sad plant powerful plant , very similar to serotonin the serotonin , methoxyltrypaminequypaminethoxyltrypamines .
If you ever see the Yanomami to the nass on the nass that make from a different species , anched methoxyltryltryltrypamine .
Tirst of that poller on for the nass is a little bit like being spared by a fire source of deping . It 's not a distorsion of electricity . Rate ] ] ] [ Rate ] doesn 't believe a distorsion of reality .
I had often often , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who gave the psychephysical , with his own fungi in Mexico .
Second my ten tamine , you can 't classify these tripamine like , because if you 're not tells any of a hallucined . Can ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] ] tripsts can 't be hort . And so , you know , because they are money from a very , which is , in a monothn-oxial , detaxial .
It 's possible to sumerely only if you 've been a little bit of other suckmies that money MAO .
Now , the beautiful : The beautiful beautiful : in the MAO , of the same kind of MAO , the same kind of need to be able to be the tripamine . The question is , in a further of 80,000 species of plants , like these people are doing these two death , like these people are found two death , but if you combine this is summer , but if you combine this is summessy , it 's summmma ?
We use the great euit of proof the proof and error , which can reveinfruttal .
But if we ask the Indians , they 'll tell us , " The plants talk . "
What does it mean ?
This tribes , the Cofan , has 17 variety of ayahuasks , which distinguy in the forest , and that our eyes would be in the same species .
If we ask them how they stumbling their txial tasonomy , they 'll tell us , " I thought about it , " No . "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night of lon and each night with a piece of different .
With this doesn 't have laurea Harvard , but it 's much more interesting to content the stami .
Now , [ [ applauses ] the problem is that also the people who have heard of the ingenes are pittoresholds , but in some way you can redoten you have a lot of the real world , and it 's pass beyond .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it will not remember for its own drives or innovations , but rather like the era that we stops and we have stops and abbraced by the passively destruction of the mass destruction of the diversity of biological diversity and cultural cultural destruction .
All the cultures through the secos have been involved in a dance for new life .
And the problem is not technology .
The Indians Sioux didn 't stop being Sioux when they put out of the arch and falls as the Americans have no stop being American American people when they put from horse , and cales .
It 's not the change technology that minaces the integrity of ethnossphere . It 's the power .
The fly over the domination .
And if you look at the world , you 'll find that these are not cultures that these are not cultures to be disappeared to .
They are living and dynamics and dynamics outside the existence of identify that will be beyond their adaptation .
Sia that 's discovered in the patria of the thinking .
a popular popular , in the sud-asiat-asiat-asiat-asiats , a popular that lived in the forest to a generation ago , and now it reduced to the services of the river of the rivers , where you can see the figure out of the figure out of the Borneo in the Moundation , where the Cinese Merian Cinese , where the navelumind-andmind-up ,
It takes the standing standing with the subtle forest .
Or , in the case of the Yanomami , are diseases that are the disease came with the discovery of the gold .
If we get on the Tibet , we 're on the Tibet , where I 'm doing a lot of research , you 'll see the fly of political domination .
As you know the genocide , the physics of a popular popular , it 's condanced to the universal , but the ethnocide , destruction of the lifetime , not only is conditions , but adstanded in certain environments , because it does it does part of the development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet from the Tibet until you 're looking at the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in China in China , through the Tibet sudoriental , coming to Lhasa lot , but only came to a young , but only came to Lhasa lot of statistics , but only came to me to talk about .
6,000 sacred to sacred and cens .
1.2 million people killed by the military during Cultural Rivolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical at Panchen Lama .
The thing means that it was killed to the template of Chinese invasion .
Stio is smoke with Santity during the diaspora that has been taken the popular in Nepal .
Sua mother was impresoned and his colpa was recognize .
It was brought to hidden in a age of two years , none of the age of two years under his gonna because it would not live without him .
The sister , who did the same , was put in reeducation .
A day , it was a drawings a fashion Mao and , for this transgression , was mitted to the workers for seven years .
The Tibet can be insubpportable , but it spirit it of the population is from the population .
Afin the end , all you reduce a choice .
We want to live in the world of the monoothy or we want to have to hold the policicromatical world ?
The great anthropologists , before he die said that his greatest landscape was that , in our own own pattern of the world , not only we see the whole gamma interter of human imagination of human imagination to a limitated modality of thinking , but one day we 'll be a day us from a sonnot only , and we 'll get the whole whole day from a sonment .
And it 's umillion remember that our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The Neolitic revolution , which given us the agriculture , which did it sucler in the cult of the seed poem , and replace the poem of the scientists , creating the gerarckler of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
The modern world industrialized to 300 years .
That several seass that we have the answers that we have the answers to all the sorts of the challenges that we 're going to do .
When these measureades of the world is asked what to say to be human , respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all risky the possibility of being what we are : a kind of conscious , which is to make all the people and all the gars can figure out . And there are great moments of optimism . And there are great moments of you get .
I 've been taken this picture on the northern of the island of Baffin , when I went to cut up with the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , he told , he told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The government has been a lot of the Inuit and the world 's popular popular and in the 1950s to stay our own premise , we have rinkered them in colonies .
The grandfather of this man reputed to go .
The family , I 'm doing his life , and took away all away all the arms , and all his reacting attacks .
You have to know that Inuit doesn 't tein , they temust the cold ,
The bad slites in origin were made of fish , were made of paper .
The grandfather than this man didn 't intimise from the night or the librarizing or the library that was suffered .
It 's gattacked up , it 's calculated the pantalone in the pantales and defected in your hand . When I got them , they 're congelated , it works on a lama .
He spred up on the dots of this college , and when I solid , it 's killed a dog .
He gave the dog and created a brilliant , with the cash , and it created a slitt , and it 's dish a sliterally , and it 's sleep in the band is sleep in the reast .
We want to talk about cavarsely with anything ? [ Risus . And this , in different ways , [ Applausi ] is the symbol of the popular Inuit and all the inuit of all the ingenes of the world .
In the 1999 , the 1999 , the canader government reached the total control of a larger area of territorary California and Texas a game together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's a territoral territority . They controlly all the miner-independent resources .
One splendide for example of a nation-state can remember with his popular .
And , to finish , I think it 's pretty obvious at least who of us was in these remote zone of us , remote that not have been accomplished .
For someone is home .
They represent sections of human imagination that they 're running to the high of the time . And for us all , the dreams of these children , become part of our children , become part of the hope .
For finally , we 're convinced to the Geographic , we 're convince politicians will never be anything .
We believe that polemiments --
[ Applauses ] are not persuasive , but we believe that the stories can change the world , and maybe we are the best institution to tell tell stories of the world . Ogen month is 35 million visitor .
156 countries transmit our television canal canal canal .
Our revivilies are literally literally .
Our work is travel in the ethnossphere to bring our audience in a wonderful place in the world 's beautiful cultural , and hope , burn for the reve-year-old world , and they 're hoping , habove the world 's world 's exists : the world 's world 's been able to be in a pluralyle and multicultural world .
where the slexide of all the popular can contribution to our collective well-being .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I wrote in this book that I hope to other than you 've heard and I 'm going to evidence some of the college of the collements , in the case not .
I want to start with what I call the dogma officer .
The official official of what ?
The official official of all society Western industrial dogma official dogma is , " If we want to massive citizens . " The way to do it is massive liberty . "
The reason is , from a handed , in fact that freedom is in the same value , it 's precious , it 's precious , it 's precious for humans .
As the other one is that if we are free , each of us can act for all that massimilar to do everything that massimilar our benefit , without one that decide in our name .
The way to massimilar to the freedom is massive choice .
More choices , more libs are free , and more liberty is their own , more liberty is their well-being .
This , I think , it 's so deeply readicated in society that nobody would such it to put it in doubt .
And it 's also deeply readicated in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has been possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly great .
I permiss a simple note about the condition for injudge .
In my sovers , there are 175 conditions , without content 10 varieties of oil and the 12 hacetes and 12 hacetes , and 12 acequipment that you can buy for you a huge number of condition in the circumstance that nobody of 175 , already ready ready ready ready ready to be your degree .
Here 's what the supermarket .
Then you go to the negotie to buy a stereo stereo : casse , radio , radio , radio , radio , plane , plane , plane , printed .
And in this single negotie of electronics , there 's a great number of components .
We can do six million different half and a half of different combinations using the components that there are only one negotie .
You have to have to admit that there is a lot of choice .
Atrust : the world of communications .
Once , when I was a child , they could get all the desire the phone , they were able to the pat the moment , and pat that moment .
It was to do the phone , not buy it .
A consequence of that , between the other , was that the phone never romped .
These tempts .
We have a variety of telephones , especially between the phones .
Here 's the mobile cellular of the future .
My favorite is the midddle , MP3 , tops of the nass , and foreign the crule to the neighborn .
If you don 't seen it in the negotie in the home , you 're butting that will be taken .
And what happens is that people enters in the negozes in the bottom and does this question . And you know , what 's answer is , " No . "
Not a cell phone that doesn 't do it too much .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than the phic explosion of choices .
Assistence health : it doesn 't happen in the United States that you go to the doctor and the doctor say what to do .
Instead , you go to the doctor , and the doctor says , " Okay , we could do At , or you know , " As " he has these benefits and these risks . " Big benefits . What do you do ? "
You have the dyes , " Dotter , what I should do ? "
And the doctor says , " As has these benefit and these benefit , and B has these benefit . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebecame , " Dottore if she was me , what would do ? "
And the doctor , " But I 'm not her . "
The result of the result of the disease , expression that it seemed it looks like a beautiful thing .
But in fact , it 's not that a smoke and responsibility to take someone that knows the doctor , which is known doctor , at someone else , and so it 's not a lot of it -- and so not in the ideal condition to take the patient .
There 's a huge marketing products , direct people like me and you , and you , that if you think it doesn 't have any sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why public them ?
The answer is that they want to be that doctor for asking them to ask them to change the recipe .
Something is that we 're going to be a hydrop is a question of choice , as you see in this vision , " We don 't want to force children . They 're not going to be able to be ydropping their sex at at the right moment . " We don 't invent a identity of identity : we need to invent .
And we can reinventing how many times us .
The means that every morning , at the risvey , you have to decide that kind of person wants to be .
I 'm spect to the family and matrimonium , a time , a common time , it was that you could be the most soon as well , and he was that he was the most soon possible , and he started to make the most soon possible .
The only real choice was with , you don 't do , and not when , and even what to do after .
On the day , it 's really to play .
I 'm going to do a lot of intelligent , and I do , and I do , at less than a time .
And not because they 're less brilliant , not because they 're less diligent .
but why are they impensierites , I 'm going to ask , " Do not ? I should do that now ? "
" Do I should have to be later ? I have to think before the children or the career ? "
They 're interrogative .
And they 're trying to answer these questions , even though this implment not completely the complicated complicated and not get a beautiful vote to my exame .
And they have to do it . They 're very important questions .
Now , the work : We lucky , like Carl sotten , because the technology allows us to work every minute , every day , every day , from every day , and every day , from every day , the corner of the planet , and that 's Hotel Randoll .
He talked about , there 's a corner , and I wouldn 't tell any one , where WiFi works .
I don 't say , because I want to use it .
What does it mean , this incredible freedom of choice that we have to work on the work ? That 's going to work or not .
We can go to see our son son , and we can play with the mobile phone in a tasks , Blackberry in the other , and the notion , the ginoccurred .
And even though they are all spent , every minute that we see our son to drawings , we are also asking , " Do you answer to this called ? "
" I had to answer this email ? I had to habboard ? "
And also when the answer is no , " that 's no , this makes the experience of your son 's very different than what it would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of it , we look at the little , and the things of life , and life is a question of choices and life is a question of choices .
Once the world was this : Ovvealed , there were some possibility , but not a question of choice .
The world today is a slide , it 's a slide thing , or negative ? "
The answer is , it 's Should you be able to be .
The positive slide are all about the negative ones .
All this choice two negative effects of people .
The first , paradoxially , it 's that produces instead of liberation .
With a lot of choice , which choose to choose , becomes very difficult to do it .
I offer a meaning example : a conduct sound plans of voluntary flap .
A my colleagues had access to the data of the Vanlooks , the giant society of thinking , with about a million clients of funny in 2,000 different companies .
What she discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are offered in more , the percentage of adesion , the lower of two percent .
With 50 source of offered , there is 10 percent in less adesions than they 're disponable to only five . Why ?
Because with 50 source of the ground , is maledly hard decide , and choice is to remaintain the initive .
And at questions , and again , questions , questions , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and of course , and I 'm not going to ask .
You know that doesn 't only mean these workers who are handing for canops , because they don 't have enough money , you also want to say that the decision is so ostics that they allow the funding is so ostics that they allow the fundamental labor .
Not parent , they 're losing up to five to a year from the dator of work , which would be bad to be true .
So the paralysis a consequence of having too much .
And I think it makes the world like this .
" And finally , for the ethernity : ketchup , senape or maionese ? "
You just want to take the right decision , if it 's for the right , right ?
You don 't want to choose the wrong source , and even the wrong condition .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoid the paralysis and make a choice , at the end , we 're not sitting from the result of how we would be with less options of the result of what we would have been with less options .
And that 's a different reasons .
One of these is that with many of these is that you would choose , if you buy it , you know , and it 's not perfect , it 's easy to imagine that you could do a different choice that would be better . And what happens is that it 's the alternative imagine , there is a lot of drive to the scels , and the rimpide , and the rid-discovered ,
And even when it was a good decision .
More choices , there 's more easy to be dispilepleasure of any detail that 's insea of choice .
It also is what economists call the constood .
Dan Gilbert asked a very well stamatter as the value we 're value to things about what we do with the things that we compared .
In the rest , when there are many options , it 's easy to represent the characteristics of the alternative , and be less unsleep , and it 's less subsed .
Here 's an example . I 've been in New York .
But it 's what you probably think about it .
There 's this copy to Hamptons .
A place of luser .
It 's splay . Otttank . It 's all about them .
Not nothing . But what he thinks , " Well , diseases , it 's Augosten . "
" All my neighbors at Manhattan is . "
" I could talk about home to front of home . "
And pass two weeks , the last weeks of the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the chance of parking where it wants .
The decrease the opportunity is the substice for what we , also have , even when the choice was old .
And more the options that we have to consider , more the characteristics that are going to be able to be against opportunity .
Here 's another example .
This vision is a lot of things .
It 's going to live the moment , and perhaps of living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you choose to do not do the other .
The things that we don 't choose are many active attractive attractive what we do .
Tirst : it 's a growth of wait .
I tried it on my skin beating a new couple of jeans .
I 'm going to be jeans .
Once the jeans were only one , buy , and they bought them from besty , were discovered , only after having them a life and worked on a lot , and worked on a lot , and worked on a lot .
So , I went to buy a couple when those old those old old those old old , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my wrong . "
The committed me , " Laxy wants to slim , hatlefit , relaxed ? "
Do you want to do it with the bottons ? " Stonewashed or " ? "
" Do you want to do it ? "
" Sotle them want to be a lot of the bla ? By , the blah , " Continured to elenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenenen
I was sitting , and after a little bit I could say , " I want the kind of -- I want the kind of one , " I want to say , " I didn 't have idea what , so for a hour eans , and then came out of the negotie , and then the best paintings , and then I had ever had .
It was the massive . I had a lot of that choice .
But I felt it .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was worse about is that with all the same choice , the myes were alties , the jeans had to be perfect .
I was wait . I didn 't expect . I won 't expected anything exceptional when it was only one of 100 different , but when I saw it was a perfect .
What I was buy , but not perfect .
After I had paragoned that choice with what I was insearch for what I was insearch for the expectative .
The addition of the people in life doesn 't make the expectations that these are respond to the old of the options that have respond to the options of the same .
And this will be less under the results , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world of marketing it .
Because if you know , if you didn 't know what I 'm talking about .
The truth more to this .
" The reason it was better when he was worse . " The reason that he was better when he was the worse was that when he was the worse was even worse , you can meet the surprised .
On the day , in the world we live -- opulent , industrialized citizens with the expection of perhaps -- the massive that we can hope is that things are in the altitude of expectations .
You never have surprised because your wait , because your wait , measurements are ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- what you 're here -- " Basse wait , " Yes , you want to . "
I mean -- little authobiography -- that I really feel and my wife is really stupied and my wife is really stupid .
I couldn 't have to do better , I didn 't have accounted .
But to contact not always is a bad thing .
And finally , a consequence of jeans a couple of jeans , when there 's only that kind of jeans is that when you 're not sleep , and you ask you , " Why ? "
" Who is responsible ? " And the answer is clear .
The world is the responsible . What can I do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and you buy a sleep , and you ask you who is the responsible , it 's the responsible , it 's altreatment , it 's altreatment , you know ,
You could have done better .
With hundreds of varieties , there are no choices for the insuccessful .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is , they feel a valid , they feel inseveral and give the colcolor to them .
In the last years , the depression is expression in the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only one , but important -- of this wavels is just that people have experiences of depression is just that people have experiences because the standard are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that the colcolor is their own .
So the end result is that we 're better better , which is that we 're better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official official , what we all take for good and it 's completely falready . It 's not true .
There is no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than having it , but it doesn 't have a lot of choice is better than a little bit .
There 's a critical value , magic . I don 't know what .
But I 'm sure we 've been supered by a piece of the level where the best choices are better our life .
Now , from the political point -- I almost finished -- from the political point , the noccise is the following .
What allows you all this choice in industrial society is the recognize material .
There are many places in the world , and you know , you know , where the problem isn 't that they have too much choice .
The problem is that they too little bit too .
So the face of the easy that I 'm talking about is a disease of modern modern , remember society Western .
And what it does to be like to be , and array is this : Steve Levitt talked about how I would expensive and discovered seats for bucks are inuseful . It 's a sprate of money .
I mean , I mean , complicated and dispendispens , it 's not just inuseful .
They 're addictelling of the etheries .
They do it stay .
If a little bit of what in our society allows it was reversed in those people where people have too much of them , it would not only be their life , but also , it would be their life . But also our life .
That 's what economists call a pareting .
A redistribution of the redent is good at all -- not only the poor -- because of this choice in excess , excess that you go back .
From , you can become everything you want to become everything you --
You can , people of culture , you think , " What creds that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make anything in a wind . "
" A castrated imagination , a limited vision of the world -- "
and I 'm interpreted it so , at the beginning .
But then , thinking about it , instead , instead , I realized that fish the knowledge .
Because the reality of fact , it 's that if you mand in frantum the bocks , so that , " You don 't get the liberty . You don 't get the paralysis .
If you get the bocks in a way that everything can divent the sliites .
Accentuate the paralysis , and you reduce the well-being .
All they need a sphere .
This is almost certainly too much , perhaps for the fish , and sure for us .
But the axed of some systems is a recipe for inficity and , for rovement .
Thank you for heart .
