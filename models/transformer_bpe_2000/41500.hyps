I 've been shown this last year , I showed these slides to demonstrate that the glacial calots , which for almost three million years had the size of 48 percent .
But this subjects this underestablished the problem because it doesn 't show the spending of ice .
The artics glacial calots is , in a way , the clever of global climate system .
You can see the winter and you reach .
The next slide is going to be a faster on the last 25 years .
The ice lost of lost are reported in red .
You can see , you expand , you expand to the blue .
That 's the ice in the winter , which is retreatment .
You can see that the cosiddictold ice , five years , it 's like the blood , which is like the blood , that 's like the blood here .
In 25 years , it 's been so , in 25 years , like this .
This is a problem because the interest of the land , the ice of ice , the ice land around the ocean where there are enormous coal amount of coal congeled that , slightly , they 're transformed into the metimes .
I 'm going to say , the totality of global atmospheric to global warming , that amount could draw , super-double , super-spective .
In some reverse lams in Alaska , the metane is already rebuling from water .
The professored Katey Walter of Alaska , in the Alaska , we 've been raised with a team .
Video : Wow ! Al Gore : That 's good . We 're going to be , we 'll be able to be us .
A reason is that this is that this termal survival from the North .
This is a glacial river .
The ported never had reached levels .
This is the Kangerlussim to the southwest of Greenland .
If you want to know how you 're going to be about the sea level of ice , in the sea level of the ice here , it 's where you reach it is where the sea .
These corrings are increasing fastly .
On the other side of the planet : Antarctica , the greatest block on the planet .
The last month , scientists have clearly clearly , that the ice of ice is in negative , and that Antarctica Western , which pogets on some submarine islands , is particularly fast in the slands .
Equival at six meters of the level of the smoke , like Greenland .
On Himalayas , the biggest blowners , you see new laghi , which few years ago were glacier .
40 percent of the world population is remember half the world 's population will be population .
Sulle Ande : this glacier is the source of the source of this city .
The dot is increased .
But when it decreases , the same happens to be powerful water .
In California , the snow on Sierra Nevada is 40 percent .
The background is in crisis .
The predictions , as you read , are graves .
Even growing section in the world leads to a remarkable increase incends .
The environmental disaster environmental disaster .
Four times more number of times in the last 30 years than previous previous 75 .
This is a whole sustainable .
If you look at it in the historical consequences .
In the last five years , we added 70 million tons of tons of tons of CO2 every day , 25 million tons in the oceans every day .
Look attention to the East Pacific , the Americas , from the Americas , the obvious both , and on both parts of the subcontinent , where there 's a radical oxygen in the oceans .
The major because of global warming , together to deforestation , which is 20 percent of us , is the use of fossil fuel use .
Oil is a problem , and carbon is even worse .
The United States is one of the two countries with more emissions , together at China .
And he was proposed to build many other central carbon dioxion .
But we 're seeing to a change of direction .
These are the annoulbly annoulbly projects in the last few years and some of alternatives .
In any way , there 's a politics in our country .
The coal and oil industries have spent 250 million dollars in the last year for the clean , which is a bone .
And that image of this image --
In Natal Tennessee , where I live , there was a 3.8 billion gallons of coal gallers .
Maybe you saw it on the news .
This is the second largest flow of scories in America .
It happened around Christmas .
The nature of one of the carbon industry was this .
Video : â™« Frosty , " Frosty is a pallies and happy .
It 's abundant here in America , and it 's growing our economy .
Frosty carbon is and more and more public .
It 's good at the price , adorable , and the workers keep the stypend .
Al Gore : From here 's a lot of West Virginia .
The biggest minial society is Massey Coal . This is his administrator .
Video : Don Blankenship : I 'm clear -- Al Gore , Nancy Pelosi , Harry Really -- they don 't know what they 're talking about .
Al Gore : So the Alliance for the Clima Proteition of Clima has launched two campaign .
This is one of them , one part .
Video : Actually , we see the climate change as a threat , as a threat , as a threat , a serious serious serious .
So our priority is to invest a great amount of money in a effort to make public and confused to make public and confused on the truth on carbon .
In fact , coal is not sports .
We think it 's clean , we think it 's also good .
So , not precoumpateves of climate change .
Let me do that .
Video : Actually : Carbon , you 've heard a lot of it .
So let 's take a turn in a turn into a structure to the clean , in fact , it 's a clean .
Straordinary ! The machines are a little noious , but that 's the sound of the technology of carbon .
coal consumption is between the major global warming global warming , but the remarkable technology of clean that you see changes everything .
Tell a look , this is the high odiernal technology .
Al Gore : In the end positive alternative connects to economic question and at the economic security .
Video : Chomvances : America is in crisis , the national security , the climate crisis .
The roof that all of us , our dependence on fossil fuel , like coal coal and oil .
Now , there 's a new audace , there 's a new car , but there 's a new .
Repower America : 100 percent of clean energy , in 10 years .
A plan to reput America to work , make sure , make sure us more secure , and help to stop global warming .
Finally , a solution that you would be solving our problems .
Repower America . Scover more .
Al Gore : This is the last .
Video : It 's about re-in-y-re-in-y-re-in-y-re-in-y-re-energy .
One of the fastest ways to bring our dependence on combustible that killing our planet planet .
What 's going to see : The future is here . Vent , only a new energy , you know , the new energy .
And what would be about two : New workers for burned burned .
Coming : Repower America . It 's time to be realists .
Al Gore : A old African proverbial African says , " If you want to go fast , you go to the fast .
If you want to go away , you go away , "
We have to go away , fast .
Thank you very much .
Last year at TED , I did an introduction in LHC .
And I promise to go back to how the machine works .
So here I am . And for the other time , there are no LHC , is the greatest scientific experiment ever -- 27 miles of circuit .
His task is to remember the conditions that were present less than a billion second of the universe -- until 600 million times a second .
All of this is just environment .
This is the car under Ginevra .
We 're photographed these mini-Bang in the relatively relatively .
This is what I work . This is called ATLAS -- it 's large 44 meters .
This is a spectacular picture of ATLAS in building so you can see the proportions .
Ten September 10 , we have accespt the machine for the first time .
And this picture was taken by ATLAS .
It was causes of immense to further in control room .
It 's a picture of the first particle phasm of the LHC , both in collision , by a part of the LHC , and spread particles in the LHC , and spread particles in the releasy .
In other words , when we saw that that the 10 september 10 , we realize that the machine worked , which is a great victory .
I don 't know if that was this to make us exultent more or this , when someone went to Google and saw that the beginal page was this .
That means we have a cultural impact on beyond that scientific .
About a week later , there was a problem with the machine , I had to these dored sleet here -- these dored dorate .
They bring 13,000 amps when the machine works at the massive power .
Now , the technicians between you look at the kids and say , " I 'm not true pleass . I 'm too sotally dream . "
And they can do that because when they 're very cold , they become the cosiddled with dames .
So , at less 271 degrees , at less 271 degree temperature to the space between the stars , these kids can bring that corporate corporate .
In one of the slowing of the most of noveys in the LHC , there was a further of further .
So the kids are survived by slightly , and the 13,000 amps suddenly , they met a electric resistance .
This was the result .
Now , this is even more impressive if you think that these magnets more than 20 tons , and that have been about 30 centimeters , and that have been about 30 centimeters .
They 're sitting about 50 magnetic .
We had to take it , what we had to do .
We restined them and adjusted .
They 're back to their place underground .
By the end of march , the LHC will be again .
We 'll accened it , and we expect to get this data to jumping or lights , and keep our adventure to discovering what the morning is the universe .
Now , of course , in a certain way , these accidents reaccend the value of science and engineering in frontier . It 's easy to be . It 's easy to confestion .
I think that 's so hard , that 's so hard , I think that 's the value of things like LHC .
I want to end with the words of a Inglese scientist , Humphrey Davy , which , imagine , in defense of the experiments of his puplick , his puple Michael Faraday , said , " Nichael Faraday , said , " Nichael is so dangerous for the ideas of science are definitive , that are not in nature , that are not in nature , that there are no mists , and that 's new world-called " and that are not knowledge . "
Thank you .
I want to start to wonder to rethink when children , from kids , played with them .
And as you get to realive how to reach them , and take them and get them , and you learn to think , and you learn to think , in fact , putting problems and manipulating relationships .
The space reasoning is deeply connected to the way we understand a lot of the world around us .
So , as a computer inspired by the uses of our interaction with physicists , and I 'm a computer in my consulting Patts , and my collaborator Jeevan Kalanithi , I started to wonder , " And if we use a computer , instead of having the only a computer , instead of having the crazy that moves on a desktop , we could deal with the information ,
and sistemared to our pleasiment ?
The question was so interesting that we decided to explore the answer , building the Siftable .
In a few words , a Siften is a interactive computer like a big computer interactive .
In a few words , a Siften is a interactive computer like a big computer interactive .
You can see them , they can move with his hand , they can see , " they feel the right movement and they have a screen and a screen and a radio radio .
But most of course , I 'm physicists , like the moroncins , you can just move on it .
Siften is the example of a new ecosystem of tools to manipulate the digital information .
And as they get more physical , consciously , the other , and as hand , as they get more physical consciously , of the other , of how we move them , we can move , and explore new styles of interaction .
I 'm going to start with some simple example .
This Siften is configurated to show video : if you include it in a direction , the video rucied like this , if they including the other side back .
These interactive rats are aware of other .
If I 'm runs , they 're interested in what around .
If they come around , they see , and they can act a little bit .
If they come around , they see , and they can act a little bit .
They also have their movement and inclination .
And then I realized one of the interesting implications of the interaction was the power to use of communicate data , for example , " to put " a color as if it 's a liquid .
In this case , we have three Siftable configurated as a sat of vernice and I can use them to color in that central , where you mix .
and I can use them to color in that central , where they mix .
If we can actually , we can put a little bit of place .
They 're also nice , like languages , like languages , math and games where people can try and see the results where people can try and see the results where people can try and see the immediately .
Now , I 'm now --
This is a Fibonacci sequence that I do with a program of equations .
Here we have a word of words that 's half between Scarabeo and Boggle .
And , in the way , at every turn to get a letter on every Siftable , Pratically , at every turn to any turn on a letter on every Siftable , and while you 're trying to words in a dionist .
Then , after about 30 seconds of you remix , and you have a new set of letters and new kinds of possibilities .
Thank you .
Here 's the children came in the gen at the Media Lab , I did it , so that they had them and turned a video .
They are very much like they were very well .
And one of the interesting things about this kind of application is that you don 't have to give people many education .
You 've got to say , " Comptions of words , " and they know exactly what to do .
Here 's other people who are trying to .
This is our young header header , on the right there .
It actually wanted to impiling them .
They were only in the moronces , for him .
Now , this is a cardboard application .
We wanted a tool for the learning of Lui 's learning about Lui . It 's Felix .
It can put new characters in the scene , just slifted the Siftable , they 're going to put them .
It can put new characters in the scene , just slifted the Siftable , they 're going to put them .
So , it 's doing this , it 's doing the sun .
Video : Sun 's sigend .
David Merrill : Now he 's taken a tractor in the scene .
Video : The arange arange .
So , I 'm going to go !
So I school in Siftable and put them neighbors can make the characters --
Video : Bau !
by making their own story .
Video : Ciao !
DM : It 's a story with the end , and it can decide him how it comes .
DM : It 's a story with the end , and it can decide him how it comes .
Video : Vola , cat .
DM : The last example I have time to show you a tool , is a tool , realized , to walk and do music .
It 's a tool , realized , to pursue and execececture music .
Siftable here act sound here like base , bass and the bacteria .
Each of these has four different variations , and you can choose what to use .
And then also , you can insert these sound sound to be in a sequence to you .
And to move it just doing it just touch a sound and a sequence .
These are effects that you can control from the alive , like the reverbs and the filter .
I 'm told it to a particular sound , and then including to fill .
And then there are the effects as time and fly , which applies to the whole sequence .
We look at how it works .
Video : DM : We 'll start putting a base in two Siftable , we 'll be in a series , we add it , we add other base .
I put a line of bottom .
Video : Do : Now I add some percussions --
Video : And I 'm going to put the battery , so I can control the effect of alive .
Video : DM : DM : I can quence the whole sequence with time from one side or another .
Video : DM : And I 'm going to add the flower to give more expression .
Video : DM : I can recombine the flight .
So I don 't have to planned it first , but I can improvising it , and more cord .
And now , finally , I can do , I can do the whole sequence with Siftable ,
Thank you .
So , as you can see , my passion is build new interface new mate interface , and more like how our brain works and more like our brain and body work .
And today , I had time to show you one of the results of this course of the results of this , and some possibilities that we try to bring out of the lab .
The concept that I want to transmit is that new generation of the new projects to interact with digital media , which will bring information in our world in the way we want .
Thank you very much .
I don 't see the time to talk to all of you .
I 'm a writer .
I writing books is my profession , but it 's more than that , of course .
It 's also love and the fascinating in my life .
And I don 't expect that it can change .
But , I said , something particular happened in my life and in my life and in my career , who took me to re-realibrate the whole work .
And the particular thing is that I recently written this book , this biography called " Mangae , Prega , Ama , " which , different from my previous books , for some reason I used in the world and become a big sensational sensationship .
And the result is that everywhere go , people go around , people treat me as if I was convicted .
In fact , convicted , convicted , convicted .
They 're engined to me now , and they say , " Don 't have to fear that I couldn 't do better ?
You don 't fear to keep in writing all life without to be able to create a book that can important someone ? "
What can you do ? "
It 's rassure .
But it could go worse , in that I remember that more than 20 years ago , when I started to say to people -- I was a adolescent adolescent -- I was a writer .
I went to meet in the same reaction based on fear .
And people said , " Don 't I couldn 't do that ?
Don 't you fear that the humiliation of killed you ?
You don 't fear to do this for all life without that nothing that nothing is ever out of it , and die on a dinfrants with the dinner douth of dying with the dinner douth of fallisment ? "
So , you know .
The answer -- the short response to all of these questions is , " Yes . "
Yes , I 'm fear of all of those things .
I 've always had fear .
And I also fear of many other things that people can 't have to introduce .
Like the high , and other things .
But , how about that I 'm write about what I thought and wonder , I 'm finally why ?
Is it rational ?
It 's logical that anyone who has to expect to be spended by a work that 's been born to do .
But what 's there so particular in the impress to make us nervous about the health , other people in a way that other charge , in a way that other careers don 't ?
How my father , for example , he was a chemist , and I don 't remember one time in his 40 years of activity where he was asked if he was fear to be engineer ?
I never -- that block of the engineer John , how is it ?
Don 't work like that , you know ?
Onestery , chemical engineers like group not certainly , in the centuries , driven the reputation of being handed maniaci .
We writers , we have this reputation , and not just writers , but creative to every kind of being huge , we have this reputation of being enormously unstable mentally .
And I don 't think about looking at the sad of death contel of creative magnificent minds that , only in the 20th century , they died young and often for them .
And even those who are not suicipate is suicipate to be actually disdish from their teons .
Norman Mailer , before he died , in the last interview said , " Every book killed me a little more . " A extraordinary connecting about work of his life .
But we don 't beat the time we feel that because we heard these things that we 've heard these things that we 've got completely interized and accepted the notion that creativity and suffering are in some way , and that art , at the end , at end , it will be in the ancient .
And the question I want to ask everybody is today is : Is you agree with this idea ?
It 's good , it 's OK , because also , looked at it from a centimeter distance to me , not good about this supposed .
I think that 's hate .
And I think it 's also dangerous and I don 't want to see it perpetuated in the next century .
I think it 's better to encourage our big creative minds to live .
And I know that , in my case -- in my situation -- would be very dangerous to start slowing to fire out of the degree feeling , especially , in my career .
And that 's what -- you know , I 'm pretty young , I 'm pretty young , I 've got about 40 years .
I still have about four decads of work in me .
And it 's very likely that whatever I write about now is going to be judly by the world as the work that came out of my last book .
I 'm slamed , because we 're all more or less friends here -- is likely that my greatest successful my high .
Oh , Great , which is , you know .
You know , this is the kind of thought that leads to be a person to start bees to beat the nine , and I don 't want to do it .
I would like to keep doing this work that I love .
So , the question is , how do it ?
And so it looks like , after many reflections , that the way to work to keep writing is to create a psychological cougical couster , OK ?
I have to find a distance of safety between me , which I 'm writing , and my natural anxiety on which is going to be able to get . And as I was trying to all the past year , trying to find other societies to see if they could have some other societies to see if they could have the best ideas to have the best ideas and healthcare .
about how to help creative people to manage inerent inerent inerent people 's emotions .
And that research took me to the ancient Grece and ancient Rome .
Seguitem because it turns out to the circle and then turn back .
In the ancient Grece and ancient Rome -- people didn 't seem to believe that creativity came from men , OK ?
And it was thought that creativity is about this spirit of beared and that came to men , and it 's been unknown to be a few source and unknown .
The Greeks were called these " spirits " demons of creativity . "
Socrate , wonderful , he believed that you had a demon a demon it .
Romans were the same idea , but they called that spirit of spirit without a genius .
which is great , because Romans didn 't really think that a genius were really smart .
They believe that a genius was this kind of entities that creded crew literally lived in the walls of a artist , a little bit like the Dobby the elfo Dobby , and that came out to see the work of the work and artest to the work of that work .
Except -- here is the distance of which I talk about -- that psychological cousual that you protect from the results of your work .
And everybody knew that was that it was like , right ?
So , the anti-to-became arts , like , for example , the narcisixm , right ?
If your work was exceptional work was not to take all the meritself , everybody knew that was helped by this genius .
If your failed work , it wasn 't all your failed , right ?
Everybody knew that was your genius to be a hunable .
And so people have conceived creativity in the West for a long time .
Then Renaissance came and everything changed , and he was born this big idea ; we put the human being in the center of the universe above all the and mysteries and without space to the mitions that write by divinity .
This was the Rational principle of the rational humanity and people started to think that creativity came from the ished idividend .
And for the first time in history , he started to referre to this or that artist as a rather than a person with genius .
And I have to say , I think it was a big mistake .
I think that allow someone , simple person to believe , like a recipient as the source , and the source of all the divines , creative , unknown and ethers , and unknown and a responsibility to a lot of too big to the fragile humans .
It 's like to ask someone to inguiate the sun .
and distores completely the ego and creates all of these inextremely expectations on performance .
And I think it was this to have been this pressure to the artists in the past 500 years .
And , if that 's true , and I think that 's the question , and now ?
Can we do it different ?
Maybe back to a more ancient understanding of the relationship between humans and creative .
Or maybe it 's not .
Maybe we can 't have 500 years of rational thinking in a 18 minutes .
And there 's probably people between the audience that would be able to read the scientific subjects on the notion of , you know , you know , you do that follow people to be on the notion of their projects .
I 'm probably not going to convince you all about this .
But the question I 'd like to get to port is -- why no ?
Why not think about this way ?
Because it 's more sense of everything that ever heard to explain the exasperformance of creative process .
A process that , as anyone who ever tried to do something -- so , basically , everybody here -- it doesn 't know rationally .
And in fact , it can sometimes completely paranormal .
I did this meeting with the extraordinary poetc , Ruth Stone , who has now 90 years old , but it was a poetesis for all life and said to me that during his rural childhood in the rural childhood , and he felt , in the fields , and he felt , in the poor , when a poor , a poem was in the poem .
He said , I was like a fragorous air train .
And that was rotating to her from landscape .
It was felt like to get , because he was a tremendous one of his feet .
He knew you had one thing to do at that point and it was , words , he 's run like a math . "
And so he run to the house and came up with this poem , and it wouldn 't have to make a piece of paper and a math and a wasn 't going to make a piece of paper .
Sometimes he couldn 't be fast fast , so he was running and running her house , and he was rotles through and he would keep it up and switch through and lost , and he would keep rotle through the landscape , and he would keep on a crowed .
Then there were those times -- this piece I never forget -- there were moments where it was almost losing , right ?
So , he was running house and he was trying to house and he was trying to paper and he was trying to a match right in the while he was going , and then he said , " He was like , " He had a sleep with the other hand and his offered .
He was going to go on the poem from and reputed it in his body and transcent on the page .
And in these cases , the poem would be presented on the perfect page and intact , but on the last word .
So when I felt that -- it 's crazy , it 's exactly equals my creative process .
I 'm not a creative process -- I 'm not a conduction .
I 'm a mulo , and my way to work is , and I 'm going to see myself at the same time and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go and go above that .
But even I , in my head , I have stripped against that , sometimes .
And I think that many of you have this , many of you , and I think that many of you have it .
You know , even if the work and the ideas came to me from a certain source , I couldn 't honestly know .
And what is this thing ?
And how can we relate to it to be able to do it , but , rather , rather , what does it do we do about it ?
I 'm just as much as I 'm about , the best contemporary example I have is the Tom Waits , which I interviewed a different paper .
We were talking about this , and we were talking about this , and you know , Tom , for most of life has been the incarnation of the artment , trying to control , manage , to manage , dominate these species of creatives totally interized .
But then I invest , he got to go and a day as he was driving on a autostrada in Los Angeles , changed everything for him .
He was going to fast and all of a sent , this little sent swimming , which comes in his head as does , electric inspiration , and it wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and he wants , you know , it 's wonderful , and he wider , but not how to take it .
It 's not a piece of paper , it 's not a mature , it 's not a record .
So I began to feel this kind of old anxiety grow in him like , " I 'm going to lose , and I 'm obsessionate by this sone-peralways .
I 'm not good enough and I can 't do it . "
And instead of going to go to the panic , he stopped .
I 'm going to do the whole mental process , and he did something completely new .
And he just looked at the sky and said , " Don 't see that I 'm driving ? "
" It seems to write a song now ?
If you really want to exist , back at a more opposed when I can take care of you .
Otherwise , go to important somebody else today .
You know , I 'm going to disturban . "
And his work , he was working process .
I 'm not work , the work was still as much of always .
But the process , and the fish that 's attornized was releft when the genius , the genius that was caused to him and further than problems and liberated .
but bad blue , this beautiful , beautiful bizarre collaboration between Tom and this strange and this strange and external thing that 's not Tom .
So , as I felt that story started to change the way I worked in this way I worked , and he had me a time .
This idea , I save when I was writing " Mangible , Prega , Ama , " and I fall in one of those cave out of the disperation where we all when we 're working on something and we can 't start to think that it 's going to be the worst , that 's going to be the worst book .
Not just , just just the worst , just the worst book .
And I started to think about gap this project .
But then I remembered Tom that was talking about air and tried to us .
So I get up my face in the manubed and deressed my common to a vacuum corner .
And I said , " Do you get , " You know , what , we 're going to be smart , you know , if this book isn 't it 's going to be internally colate , right ?
Because as I see , I 'm putting all I have , I don 't have any more than that .
So if you want to be better , you have to make your part .
OK . But if you don 't know what , I don 't know what I 'm not to do .
I 'm going to writing the same because it 's my work .
And I want to do for that I 'm now now I 've been shown to do my part . " Because -- at end , it 's so , OK -- centuries ago in North Africa 's deserts people had to be sadded for the clear of the clear of the clear of the clear of the clear of the clock , damn and high .
And they were always magnificent , because the ballerners were professionals and they were fantastic .
But every once , rarely , something happened , and one of these artists became actually .
And I know what I 'm talking about , because I know you all have seen it , at some point , a performance .
It was like the time stopped , and the dance walking through a kind of a bral brings and not doing anything different from the usually , like the 1,000 nights before , like the 1,000 night before , it 's going to squarters .
And suddenly , not appeared as a human .
But it 's accessed from the divinity and below the fire of divinity .
And when this happened , on the time , the people knew what was , they call him with his name .
They knew hands and started cantar , " Allah , Allah , Allah , God , Allah , God . "
That 's God , you know .
By known as historic -- when More invaded the south of Spain , took this habitude with them and pronouncers , and he changed it in the centuries , Allah , " at , Allah , " , " the role , " that you can hear in the corrids or in the boards or in the bottom .
In Spain , when a artist has done something impossible and magical , " Allah , " words , " " Spain , " Spain , " Brate , " ununderstandable , etrate , " under God .
And it 's great because we need it .
But , the problem is goes the day , for the dance , when you wake up and discover that 's the 11 morning of Marteden in the morning of Martedust , and the God 's not longer .
It 's just a mortal with the knee ginnews , and maybe it never to hear that alone .
And maybe there 's no one will sing God still , and what 's like , so what 's going to do with his rest of his life ?
It 's hard .
This is one of the most painful remember in a creative life .
But maybe it 's not to be so angos-to be so angosh , if you can 't believe , inside , the most extraordinary aspects of your being from yourself .
But you just believe that you 'd be prested by a inimaginable source of this squisite part of your life that you have to go to somebody else when you finished .
And , you know , if we think about this is all changing .
And so I started thinking about it , and it 's certainly like this , I thought for a different months in the book that I 'm going to publishing soon , spent , spent , I 'm dangerous , followed , I 'm followed by the way of my great success .
And what I have to keep telling me when I feel electric that I 'm not afraid .
Don 't fly . It 's just your work .
Continous presented to your part , any part , any can be .
If your work is dancing , balls .
If the divine , absurd genius to do decide to leave some kind of wonder , for one moment through your effort , for one moment through your effort , then , " Ole ! "
Otherwise , do the same thing .
" Ole ! " " From you .
I think , I think , you know , I think , I have to teach it .
" Ole ! " at yourself , even for the same , even for having loor human testardaggin tals to be represent .
Thank you .
Thank you .
June Cohen : Ole !
And as you know I 've already talked about some of these projects on the human genome , about what can mean and the new genes of new genes .
We 're starting a new way . We started to digitalize biology and now from that digital code we 're going to go into a new phase of biology , designing and synthesizing life .
We 've always tried to bring big questions .
" What is life ? " It 's something that many biologists have tried to understand lovels .
We tried different approaches , reduced it , reduced it .
We 're digitalizing by almost 20 years .
When we sequenced the human genome was to go from the analog world of biology in the digital world of computer .
We 're going to ask : can we regenerate life , or make new life from this digital universe ?
This is the map of a small organism , Mycoplasma genome , which is the smallest genome of those who can autorem in lab .
And we tried to reduce the genome of the genome to create one more smaller .
We 're able to eliminate a hundred genes of about 500 genes that are here .
But when we take a look at his metabolic map , it 's relatively simple than our .
I think , this is simple .
But when we look at all the genes that we can eliminate , one at a time , it 's very improbable that this can bring to a living cell .
So we decided that the only way to make a synthesize this cromosome that we can modify to get the components to bring the components to bring the city of these fundamental questions .
And so we started the adventure of " We can synthesize a cromosome ? "
And that 's the chemistry connecting these great molecules that we never have to make it before ?
And , in case , can we make a cromosome ?
A cromosome is simply a chemist of chemical material .
The speed with which we can digitalize life is growing exponential rhythm .
Our ability to write the genetic code , rather procrete , rather , but it 's improving .
And our most recent results of our most recent results .
We started more than 15 years ago .
The process is required a lot of pass , starting with bioetic review before we began the first experiments .
But we discovered that synthesize that DNA is very hard .
There are tens of thousands of cars on the world that produces that produces small DNA , of 30 to 50 letters and it 's a process : the more segment is more , the longer segment is more , the segment is more errors .
So we had to develop a new method to assembly these brothers and correct the mistakes .
And this was our first attempt to go from the digital information of the genome of Phi X 174 .
It 's a little virus that kills kills .
We designed the fragments , the fragments of the errors , and got a molecule of DNA , about 5,000 letters .
The interesting part is when we took this chemist of chemist , and we put it in the bacteria , bacteria have started to read this gene and make gene code and produce the viral particles .
The viral particles have been record from the cells , are back and destroke the E. coli .
I 've been talking about recent with membrrow of the oil industry and they certainly understood this model .
They 've been rice , more than you .
We believe that this is a situation where the software can actually build his own in a biological system .
But we wanted to do the biggest things .
We wanted to build the whole cromosome of the bacteria .
I 'm more than 580 miles reading of genetic code .
So we thought I 'd build it in cassettes of the virus , so that we can change the cassettes for the living of the cell .
The design is crucial , and if we start with digital information in a computer , these have to be very accurate .
When we sequency this genome for the first time in 1995 , the standard time was a mile for every 10 miles .
We discovered , resequency , 30 errors . If we used that original sequence , we would never be able to work .
One part of the process is designing 50 letters that are subsigments that are subsidies with all the other segments of 50 letters to build subunity smaller .
We try to be only one of the way , we 're going to try to .
You probably have read , you 've read that we put on the physical file .
Think about four letters : we have a genetic code on four letters : A , C , God and T.
Three of those letters together codify about 20 minoacids , and there 's a specific order to each other .
So we can use the genetic code to write words , framework , framework , thoughts .
What we did in the beginning was autograph to do .
Some of them have been delivered by the fact that it was not poem .
We designed these segments to just join them to be just unique with enzyme .
There are enzymes that repair them and put them out .
And we started assembly to assembly , starting with segments five to segments from segments to segments , under 24 mils , until the segments of 24 miles .
And we have these segments in abundance , so we have to sequencing them out of sequencing to create a extremely robust -- how you see in a minute .
We 're trying to automatize the process .
So , this looks like the tabellon a playoff of a basket .
When we get to the way to these very long segments , more than 100 miles , they will never grow more directly in the E. coli .
You get to the limit of the modern tools of modern biology .
So we 've been considered other mechanisms .
We knew about another mechanism called recombination called homologa recombination , which in biology can bring the DNA can unite the segments .
Here 's an example .
This organism , called Deinococcus radiodurans , it can absorb three million rad .
You can see in the super-way requarters like his chromosome .
In 12 -- 24 hours is reassembled exactly how it was before .
And there are thousands of organisms that are able to do .
And these organisms can completely sign .
They can live under a vacuum .
I 'm absolutely certain that life exist in space , and you moved to find new environments of water .
In fact , NASA showed that this is .
This is a picture of the molecule that we built using these processes , just using the least segments to put in appropriate segments .
The least assemble to do the automatically .
This image was not taken with an electronic microscope , but with a regular microscope .
It 's a molecule that we can see it with a microscope .
These are pictures that cover a six seconds .
This is the advertising that we did a little time ago .
I 'm more than 580,000 letters of genetic code .
It 's the largest molecule of the defined structure never created by man .
It 's got a molecular weight in 300 million .
If we passim with a 10 without spaces , you 'd like 142 pages , they would just take this genetic code .
Now , how do we do that ? How can we do that ?
Of course , a virus is a guys a game of guys .
It 's a little more complicated when you use bacteria .
It 's easier when it 's simpler cells like our : You can just extract the nucleus and put another , which is basically the clonically and put another , which is basically the clonically .
In the bacteria , the chromosome is integrated instead of integrated in the cell , but we recently recently demonstrated that we can do a complex cromosome from a cell to another and activity .
We could refix a chromosome parting from a microbial species .
The two are different how humans from the rooms .
We 've added some gene , in more , in a way that we could decide to choose for this chromosome .
And then skiing with the ends to kill all the proteins .
And when we put it in the cell of the cell was study -- and appreciate our sophisticatooos -- the new cromosome went into the cell .
And we started to think that we didn 't go beyond , but we tried to spend up there .
This is one of the major mechanisms of evolution .
We 've found that so many species have added species have to a second or a third cromosome of new tracts of new tracts to that species .
So who think about evolution as only a gene gene time that modies doesn 't understand a lot of biology .
And there 's enzyme , called " restriction , " which advantage of the DNA .
The chromosome that was in the cell .
The cell phone that we have inserit-cell phone that we put it .
It 's expressed , and he recognized the other chromosome as a strong material , has masticated , and we found it with only the cromosome .
it blue because of the genes that we 've put in .
And in a short of time , all the characteristics of a species went along , and it turned out in a new species , based on the new software that we put in the new software that we put in the cell .
All the proteins are , and they have changed , and when we read the equival code exactly what we 've transfers exactly to what we 've transfers .
Now , this could look at genetic , but altering the software , but altering the software , we can change things in a substantial enough .
Now , I 've been explained that here you don 't talk about genesis -- but progress to go from three and a half million years of evolution , and I said that maybe we 're going to create a new version of Cambrian explosion of Cambrian explosion in which will come to be created new version of this digital process .
Why do that ?
I think it 's obvious enough when we think about our need .
We 're going to go from six and half billion people in nine billion in the next 40 years .
Just for an example : I was born in 1946 .
Now there are three people on the planet for each existing in 1946 ; there will be four years old .
We 're having problems now to find food , fresh water and clean , medicinal and balloon for six billion and a half billion people .
It will be more drive to do it for nine billion .
We use more than five billion coal , more than 30 billion coal bets .
That means , I think , as well , as well as a day .
When we try to find biological processes , or any kind of process to reduce them , it 's going to be a huge challenge .
We have to keep accounts of all the emission of CO2 from these materials that end in the atmosphere .
And today , because of the scientific discovery of the world , we have a database with about 20 million genes , and I like to think that they are designed for the future .
The electric industry only is a dozen , about about a dozen of components , and think how many different things came out .
Our limits here are very much data from biological reality and from our imagination .
Now we have techniques , because of the synthesization , in creating what we call combinatory genomics .
We 're able to build a big robot that can produce a million cromosomes that can produce a million cromosomes a day .
Think of processing these 20 million genes or to try to get the processes to produce either , or drugs , new vaccines , and new vaccines , we can change , because of a small team , and create more biology , and create more biology , and more biology , and create more biology , and more biology in the last 20 years of science .
And it 's just a standard selection .
We can choose for survival , chemistry , production , chemistry or fuel vaccine , etc .
This is an instantaneous instantaneous show that we 're working on to be able to seat and design species to the computer .
Well , we don 't need to be .
We know exactly what their genetic code .
Now we 're now concentrating on the fuel of fourth generation .
You also saw that extract ethanol from the grate was a finished experiment .
We have secondly , we have a lot of second-generation , and third generation that they 're going to be higher than eightan or different types of butanol .
But the only way that biology can have a big impact without increase without increase more than food and limited the display of food and limited the avity is to transform CO2 in matter , so we 're working on to design cells that can achieve the first way we 're working on to design cells that can achieve this , and we think we can have the first carbon as 18 months .
The sunlight sunlight with CO2 is a metodow -- but in our discovery different metods around the world , we found different metods .
This is an organism that we described in 1996 .
It lives in the deep ocean , about 2500 meters of depth of water .
They realized by CO2 using molecular , using hydrogen molecular source .
We 're trying to figure out if we can meaning the CO2 , which can easily be transported tubes , convert that CO2 in fuel , to drive this process .
So , short we can be able to increase what we can do is increasing what the basic question is what life is the Nice life is Nice , versus -- we have the goal modjumpy .
Exactly . If you can 't do it from TED , where can you ?
It would be a main source of energy .
And we 're working on the same way , we 're working to use the same methods to create vaccines .
You saw this year with flu , we 're always back in a year , and with a dollar in less when it 's true to find the fair .
I think that you can change building vaccinable vaccinable in a lot .
Here 's how the future could start to look at change , now , the tree of evolution , by acceling the synthetic bacteria , archy , arches , archy , and finally cellus .
We 're so on the best people .
Our purpose is to do a long enough to try to do it . Thank you very much .
I 'll show you , the most quickly possible , to show you , the most fundamental work , some fundamental work , of new technology that we took Microsoft in followed a year ago . This is Seadragon .
This is a environment where you can interact is in the local level that remote with a huge amount of visual data .
Here we 're seeing here here , very much gabyte picture with a kind of photos and continuous fast , for a panoramic fast , disponing the images how we want .
And it doesn 't matter how big the amount of information that we see , how big these are collected or the images of data or images .
Most of them are common digital photographs , but this is a scan from the Biooo of Congress , and reverse in the crowd of 300 megapixel .
It 's not any difference because the only thing that the prestations of a system like this is the number of pixels on your screen on your screen in any time . It 's also a very flexible architecture .
This is a whole book , example , not of data , not images .
This is Dickens of Dickens . Every colonna represents a chapter .
And to show you that 's just about textbook is not of images , we can do something like that , to make a real thing that it 's a representation of the textbook , not a picture .
It could be a little artificial way to read an electronic book .
It 's not consider .
This is a more realistic example . This is a number of The Guardian .
Every big picture is the beginning of a section .
And it really gives you the beautiful experience of reading the beautiful version of a magazine version of a magazine , which is for nature , a lot of half .
We also did something with the angle of this particular number of The Guardian .
We created a fasulla ads to higher solutional solutional advertising -- much more than what you use in a normal advertising -- and we put you in the extra content .
If you want to see the characteristics of this automobile , you can see it here .
Or other other models , or even the techniques .
And this really demonstrates some of these ideas to eliminate limits of space on the screen .
We hope that that means to put up in the pop-up pop-up and other symps like , they don 't have to be necessary .
Of course , the maps is one of the most obvious applications for this kind of technology .
And I don 't want to lose time , if we don 't have contributes to give to this in this field .
These are all the streets in the United States , you know , a geospace image of NASA geospatial picture .
So now we go to something else .
This is now actually from the web , in the web ; you can see it .
This is a project called Photosystems , which combine two different technologies .
One is Seadragon and the other is a visual visual computer at the very interesting computer , in fact by Noah Snavely , a student of Washington , with Steve Seitz of the UW and Rick Szeliski .
And it 's from Seb , gestite from Seb , gestite .
You can see it when we do this kind of patterns , where we can go from an image to the other and have this kind of multiple resolution .
But the space of the images of the images here has actually a meaning .
And the algorithms of visualization of computing have recorded these images together , so that correspond to the real place where the images -- all of the images -- all of the way , and that 's been taken . So , the canaded Roccious sang -- they were taken . So , the drivable , these things have been taken . So , you can see elements of space .
I don 't know if I have time to show you some other environment .
There are some more space .
I want to go directly to one of the original Noahhhimself -- and this is from a Photosystems that we did work for the first time , the scorse-scorsex , that we 've been doing the clear behind this technology , Photosystems . And it 's not necessarily extent that we put in the website environments we 've put in the website environments we 've put in the site environments that we 've got in the website .
We had to worry about the legal aspects and so on .
This is a rebuild of the Notre catthedral from Flickr . Baast digitar Notre . Baast digitar in Flickr and you get images in the magicians , other people in magicions , and so on . You 've got images in the image that 's a picture that 's discovery appear to this model .
So they 're all pictures took by Flickr , and they were all connected to the space level in this way .
And it 's possible to navigate in this very simple way .
You know , I never thought I 'd never have thought about end up working for Microsoft .
It 's very gratifying to receive this kind of accohy here .
I think you can see that it 's about a lot of different types of different types of different samples : from those SLR SLR , a significant number , put together in this environment .
And if I can , I try to try to look for those strange .
A lot of them are blocks by faces , etc .
Somewhere there is a series of photographs -- and there it 's a series of photographs .
This is a poster of Notre Dame recorrectly .
We can go from poster to the vision of this environment .
The essential point is that we can do things with social environment . This is now taking data from the entire college of how the land looks like the land , from visual perspective -- and connects all of those data together .
All those pictures become connected , more than the sum of the sum of parts .
You have a model of the entire that emerges .
Think about this as a Stephen Lawler 's work on Earth .
It 's something that grows in complexity as people use , and the advantages for people who are using it , and the advantages for the use .
Their pictures are brand , and they put in insert ,
If someone 's idea to the idea of contract all these saying the name , my picture of Notre catthedral to Notre , you remember of all of the data , and I can use how much of the data , and I can use it as a kind of cross-moot-cross-mo-cross-moed experience of cross-mobile cross-mobile cross-mobile cross-mobile cross-mobile cross-mobile experience .
Of course , a consequence of all of this is virtual models of any interesting than any of the land , collected , and you don 't just as an awars , and similar images , but from the college memory .
Thank you very much .
Chris Anderson : I understand ? What your software is going to be able to do is that , in the next years , all the next years , all the shared photographs , all shared by anyone in the whole world will be connected together ?
BAA : Yeah . What he 's doing is actually discover .
He 's creating hyperlink , if you want , among images .
And it 's doing it in the basis on the content of the images .
And the thing becomes very interesting if you think about seats of semantical information that many of these images have been able to do .
As a picture of images on the Web , you 're digital page on the web has a sentence and the textbooks .
Now , what if that is that if that picture is connects to all your picture ?
So the amount of interconnection and the amount of wealth that is really huge . It 's really huge . It 's a classic effect of the network .
CA : Blaise , it 's really amazing .
BAA : I thank you very much .
One of the major pleasures when you travels and one of the delicies of the ethnographics is the power living between who has no forgots , the past to the wind , the past to the wind , the stones in the leviged stones , levers it in the leaf , levering to leap .
Basti think that Jaguar travel still travel over the Via Lattea , or that the Inuit is still colors of meaning , or in Himalayas , the Himalayas , the buddies are still purn of Dharma , to remember the importance of the Dharma , and the idea that the world that the central environment we live , but it 's just a model of reality .
the consequence of a particular set set of choices that our own own ris , right or bad , many generations ago .
And , of course , we all share of the essential tracts .
We all of them . We all procrease .
We 're going to be able to be returned .
We have to deal with the inesorability of death , so we don 't surprising and we 're sitting , and we go .
We all have an art .
What hits is the specifically rhythm of the song of every culture .
It doesn 't matter that they are the Meds of Borneo , or the following Vooodoo Haiti , or the warriers of the Kaisut in Kenya , or a cameras in Kenya , or a cameras in the heart of Sahara .
He was my journey in the desert a month ago , or a yaks , or a yaks of the Qomolangma , on Everest , the world-of the world valley .
All of these people teaching us that there are other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of thinking , other ways of mods of thinking , other ways of mods of mods of the world .
And , if you think , you 'll be a concept that can give you hope .
And together , with , cultures of the world 's cultures create a ragela of spiritual life and cultural life that 's important for the well-being of the planet as biological ragela .
And you can think about this ragela cultural ragela sphere and you can define the sum of all the concepts , dreams , mites , mites , ideas , inspirations , ideas , inspirations , clusted to be from the humans from the high of consciousness .
The etnosphere is the patrimony of humanity .
It 's the symbol of what we are and what we can be as a species .
And because the biosphere has been a further of ethnosfy has happened to ethnosfy and much much more quickly .
No biologist , for example , would say that 50 percent of all species has been or is on the hort of simply because it 's false , or -- in the most apocalypocalyypocalyypocalycket -- and not even as closed to the most optimistic diversity .
The index of all that is , of course , the language losical .
When you 're born 6,000 languages on this planet .
A language is not only composed by a vocabulary or a series of rules .
A language is the spraper of the human spirit .
It 's the midddle that we have to be able to be in the material world .
Every language is a forest of the mind , a forest , a spiritual ecosystem .
And of those 6,000 languages , as we 're sitting here in Monterey , at least half , it 's not sustaff in children .
They don 't come to teach kids , which means , unless you can 't walk , unless wasn 't going to be in .
What 's more sad about being the silence , of being the last silence , to be the last speaking to talk a language , not to have to transmitted the wisdom of the soul of ?
This is a slightly , there 's been someone in the world every two weeks : every two weeks , a high and brings to the source in the tomble , the so-called the Over tomble .
And I know somebody to say , " Isn 't that ?
The world would not be a better place if we 're talking all the same language ? " Well , we talk to all the yorba . We talk about cantonese .
We talk about kogs .
You will cover a tract of what it means , you can 't talk about language .
I 'd like to do a journey through the ethnosphere --
a little journey in ethnosphere to give you a little bit of what we 're losing .
Many of us forget that when I say , " different ways of existing really different ways of existing exists .
Let 's take for example , this baby Barasan , in Amazon , the sacres of anaconda , which credies of my burn river , which creating the myth of sacare in the snarrow of sacres .
This is a populal populal that 's not to distinguish the blue color from the green because it 's re-identified in the time of forest , which depends the people 's popular .
They have a strange language and a young regularly , language of language . " You have to marry a different language .
All of this roots in the past , yet the partnership , but the partnership of these extremes that are about six or seven languages , because of marriage mons , no practical matrimons .
They 're just listening to hear and then start talking .
We take one of the most interesting tribes that I lived , the Waorans of Ecuador Ecuador , a incredible populous people who had the first counts in 1958 .
In 1957 , five missionaries have tried to a factor .
They did go down from the photographs that had been sitting in a few of adished adished , that this popular population 's never seen anything about two-dimensional forestimate .
They raised the picture of the land , they turned out to the shape or a figure and , not that they have been boring with the direction , and they killed the five deavel .
But the Waorani , they don 't just killed the strange of them .
They killed in each other .
54 percent of the mortality was caused by themselves .
We 're high at eight generations and we found two natural cases , and when we indeed to know , they admed that one of them was invited so that he was invited so that he was dead by , and then killed him . And then they killed it .
The crazers could recognize the 40 steps and recognize the species .
I was in the early ' 80s , I was assigned a very interesting tasks when I was asked , I was asked if I wanted to go to Haiti to an intruly truly touched to the base of Duvalier and Tonton Macouter and Tonton Macoutes , and impossessing out of the fast in the first ' 80s .
To give a sense to miraculous sense , I should have to understand the Vodoo culture and that Vodoo is not magic .
This is a very complex metaphysical vision of the world .
Very interesting .
If I asked to tell me the big religions of the world , what would you say ?
Christianism , Islam , Budddddism , etc .
A continent is always left out , thinking that the sub-Saharan Africa has not religious field . And instead of Vodoo is not that the distillate of these religious concepts of these very profound distillate concept of these very profound slavery in tragic sy .
What 's interesting to be the voodoo is the intense relationship between life and death .
So , the living is to the spirits .
The spirits can be invited by the Great Acqua , respecting rhythm of the dance and replace temporary to the soul of vive the way that for a short , and it 's a little bit the following .
So , the voodooists like , " You know , white white , you know , " You know ,
We say in the temple and we forget God . "
And from the moment that you 're going to be , is the spirit that you can do the evil ?
So you 're seeing these amazing events : follow up in the state of trance that touch impunvehicles , a rather strong demonstration , rather strong a demonstration .
In all the people who have been lived with the most extraordinary people are Sierra Nevada de Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta , in Colombia sectrional .
Except of the ancient civilization that once had to the covers of Colombic , in the card , the remarkable popular massive popular massive planture .
In a macy continent , blood continent , this popular popular , this has never been conquered by spages .
And in today , they are government by a cler-clery , but they 're very extraordinary .
The young people followed by the families , and they live in a world that they have been doing in a good world and shadow in a world that 's made of stone of the base of the ice for 18 years .
Two periods of nine years of the managed to reproduce the nine months of gestation that spent in the mother of the mother , now I 'm metaphorically in the Great Mother .
And that time , they 're acculturated to the values of their society , values that their predicts and their predicts , and just their predict , they keep the cosmic balance -- or to say the ecological .
At term of this amazing began , and it 's suddenly taken out and for the first time in their life , at 18 years , they see a high . And in that account of the first sun , when the sun behind the valley of the first sun , when the sun behind valley , everything that learned in the splanding of the behind . The predict does it says .
" Visy , " I 'm like , " I said .
It 's amazing . Now it 's about you protect it . "
They call them the bigger brothers and say that we , brothers , we 're the colpurs of destruction of the world .
This is a level of intuition is extremely important .
When we think about indeed populations and the environment , we 're saddress and the old story of the noble sely , which is a razy concept in his simplicity or perhaps we 're sadgering in the Earth of us .
The populs are not even even sentimental feels , nor from the nostalges .
There 's no space for these things in the malaries of Asten or the gelids in the Tibet , but because it 's a mystics of time and the returns , they created a mistic of the Earth 's known , but on a burn of nearly known : the concept that the Earth can only live only because it 's infected by the way of human-knowledge .
What do you mean ?
It 's like a boy of the Ande that grows of the mountains that the mountains is a huge Apu who will drive his destiny is going to be a profound different human beings and will have a different relationship with the mountains or that place in Montanan 's growing boy that a boy of Montanan 's rock that grows up a stick mass of rock .
which is the dead of one of the spirit or a mineral city is irrelevant .
What 's interesting is the metaphor that defines the metaphor is , the natural world .
I grew up in the forests of the Britannica credating that the forests service for the forests to be cut .
And this was a different human being from my friends Kwakiutl who believe that the forests are the forests of Hukuk and the purches of paradise and the paradise of paradise and the dogs that live on the extreme , spirits that deal during the beginning the Hukukuk 's dealing in the beginning Hukukukukuk and the site .
If you start to look at that these cultures can create different reality , you can start to understand some of their sensational sensational . We take this piece .
I 've taken this picture to open in the nordoctorized in the Northnadoctors .
Mayahuash , some of you 've heard about the psychoactive , the most powerful subsidic repertoire .
What 's a fascinating pluhuash is not the physical potential of the substance , but his elements . It 's from two elements .
From a side , this leased leap that contains a series of Tia-C-carboline , harmed and harmed , slightly hallucinogenes .
Take the only plant is a blue smoke that alters a little bit of consciousness , but it 's mixed with the leaves of a family of the Psychoteled Psychoteled .
This plant contains , very similar powerful plant , very similar to seroxypltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltryltrylens .
If you ever see the Yanomami , you 'll see the nose , the nard is that make from a different set of species , anch-thoxypamine contains .
And so , in the dust , is a little bit like being shooted by a little bit of puts painting painting of baroks and land on a sea .
I 'd spent a lot of my professor , Richard Evan Shultes , the man who took the psychedelic was psychedelic , with his discovery of the rocket in the ' 30s in Mexico .
I think , my thesis , you can 't be to classify these tripams as because if you 're not telling any of being train .
It 's possible to be absually just if you were to be assumption with other chemicals that money MAO .
Now it 's just the beautiful : carboline dies that are in this lian MAO , the same kind of MAO , the same kind of need to be able to be able to be triprawling . The spontanem is in a flower of 80,000 species of plants , how these popular populs are not that , but that if you combine , in this way , create a biochemical version that 's over-like parts ?
We use the great eulife-proof and error , which can reveal .
But if we ask the Indians , " The plants talk about us . "
What do you mean ?
This tribes , Cofan , has 17 variety of the gaxuahuasks , which are distingue , and that our eyes would go into the same species .
If we ask him how do they do they do their tasonomics say , " I thought about plants , " I thought about plants , you don 't know ? " I said , " No . "
The solution is : you take the 17 variety in a night of moon and each night with a tone .
And that 's not sleep to Harvard , but it 's much more interesting that to count stams .
Now , [ , ] the problem is that even those of us who have at heart people who have heart in the ingenes are painting , but somehow reduced to the sea story of the real world , and pass .
In fact , the 20th century , between 300 years , it 's not going to be remembered for his wars or its innovations , but rather like the era that we stopped and abbracing activity of the planet . Now , the problem is not the problem of biological diversity of the planet . Now the problem is not the change .
All cultures through the centuries have been involved in a dance for new life .
And the problem is not technology .
Indians Sioux don 't have to be Sioux , when they put out of it and fell as the Americans have no stopped being Americans when they put out of Americans have been Americans when they put out of the Americans and heat .
It 's not the change or the technology that thnosphere . It 's not the power .
The hard of the domination .
And if you look at the world , you 'll discover that these are not cultures that these are not cultures destined to disappear .
They 're living creatures and dynamics spints out of identifable forces that go beyond their abilities to adaptation .
And that 's disboscaring in the Penan Patria of the Penan --
a popular nomake Sarak , in southeast , a populous populous populous who lived free to the forest to a generation , and now reduced to the service and the service on the reservous revenume , where you can see the walked from the lights , where you can see the floor of Borneo in the MCinese MCinese , where the Ellumine MCinese , where the naves are soulluminate ,
and you can just fill the stock with the subtle wood .
Or , in the case of Yanomami , are the disease that have come to the discovery of the gold .
If we move on the Tibet mountains of the Tibet , where I 'm doing many research , you 'll see the political domination .
As you know , the genocide , physical extinction of a popular popular , it 's conviction , but the ethnocide , the destruction of the lifetnocise , it 's not only about , it 's convicted , but it 's a celebrated in environments , because it 's part of the strategy development .
And you can 't understand the Tibet , until you 're not part of the beginning .
I lost the 6,000 miles from China in Western China in the Western Tibet , in Lhasa with a young connecting young , but only came to Lhasa , I realized what 's behind the statistics that we hear .
6,000 sacres sacres in dust and crazy .
1.2 million people killed by the military during the Cultural Revolution .
The father of this guy was ascritical dad to Panchen Lama .
which means it was that it 's been killed to the Chinese d-time .
His , in the uncle , in the diaspe that has taken the diaspora that led people popular in Nepal .
His mother been impresoned and his colpattern was rich .
It was taken of hidden in a couple of two years , hidden under his gunder his gonna because he couldn 't live without him .
The sister , who made the same , was put in a reeducation .
One day he washed a day , a soup switch , and this transgression , was put on the works of forced , was brought to seven years .
The pain of the Tibet can be insopurable , but the reference of the people 's population .
And then , in finally , all reduces to a choice .
We want to live in the monoful world of monoful monothy or we want to across the poloooes ?
The great anthropologist Margaret Mead , before he died said that his greatest fear was that , in our way to the love of the world , we will see the whole gamma of human imagination , we will see the whole gamma of human imagination , but one day we will wake up from a sonno sonning , we 'll be able to be able to be sonism .
And it 's humiliating our species is existed for 600,000 years .
The Neolitical Rivolution , who gave us the agriculture , which made us to the seed culture of the seed , and replacing the poem of the slerarchia , creating the gerarchy of the specialization , and we talk about 10,000 years ago .
modern world has been 300 years old .
That 's a story , not suggests that we have the answers to all the challenges that we have to deal with the millennia that we 're going to go .
When these cultures of the world is asked what it 's going to say , " human being , they respond to 10,000 different voices .
And it 's in these answers that we all realize the possibility of being what we are are -- we know , we have to make some kind of people and all the people 's populs and all the people can truly trusts can track .
I took this picture on the extremity of Baffin the island of Baffin , when I went to the Inuit , and this man , Olaya , Olaya , Olaya , told me the wonderful story of his grandfather .
The canadly government was not always gentle with the Inuit and in the ' 50s to stabilish our premise , we rhink them in colonies .
And the grandfather of this man refed to go .
The family , I teaching his life , took him all the arms , and all his attices .
You have to know that the Inuit doesn 't teach cold , exploit .
The sleeps in origin were made of fish in origin were made of cartoon .
The grandfather of this man didn 't intimise from the artica or the libraries ,
It 's gattaiolated by focused , and focused on sunched pelods and defer in his hand . When the I did the tour , and he 's congelated , and he 's working on a lama .
He 's spred on the door of this crap of crap , and when it became solid , he killed a dog .
He took a dog and created a brid , with the hord cassh , he created a sleeping , he had a sleeping , and it 's disappeared on the bankners ,
We want to talk to cavarring with anything ?
In the California government reached the canaw of the total control of a larger in the world of the larger of California and Texas messes together .
It 's their new patria . It 's called Nunavut .
It 's an independent . It 's a record .
One beautiful example of how a nation-state can remember with his people .
And , finally , I think it 's pretty obvious , at least at least at who of us was in these remote zones that not are remote .
For someone is home .
They represent of human imagination that are represent humans that are represented to the high of these children , like dreams of these children , like dreams of the kids , become part of the hope .
In finish , we , in National Geographic we are convinced that politicians will never get to nothing .
We believe polemiics --
[ Applauses ] not are persuasive , but we believe that stories can change the world , and maybe we 're the best institution to tell the world . Each our site is in our site . Each our site is 35 million lives .
156 countries transmit our television canal canal .
Our re-views is long-millions of people .
Our work is travel to bring our audience in a place of wonderful amazing cultural wonderful , where they go away from the way , they go away from how they saw and hopefultical , abbracing will be in the world , and we have to find a lot of life in a pluralists in a different world , and we have to find a life in a pluralistic pluralistic world .
where the wisdom of all the people can contribute to our collective wisdom .
Thank you .
I 'm going to talk about some things I 've written in this book that I hope to reach you already to see some connections , in fact , I 'm not going to try to .
I want to start with what I call " the official dogma . "
The official dogma official of what ?
The official dogma official dogma 's dogma official dogma : " If we want to massive wealth our citizens . " If we want to multiple our citizens . "
The reason is , from a side , in fact that freedom is in itself a value , is precious , useful , essential for humans .
And the other is that if we 're free , each of us can act for all that massimilar to do everything that massimizes our weless .
The way to massive freedom is massive to be choice .
The more choices people have , the more than they are free , and more is their wealth , more than their well-being .
This , I think , it 's so deeply radical in society that no one would drew to doubt .
And it 's also deeply radical in our lives .
I 'm going to show you some examples of what progress has made possible .
This is my supermarket . It 's not particularly great .
I 'm a simple note about conditions for insalate .
In my supermarket are there 175 conditions , without contate 10 varieties of oil and 12 aceps and the 12 aceps and the 12 acks that you can buy for a huge number of conditions in the crowd circumstance that no 175 ready ready ready to be your gredisplay circumstance .
Here 's what supermarket is .
Then go to the electronic store to buy a stereo stereo , CD , lector , radio , radio , the CD , radio , pracer .
And in this single negotie negotie negotie in this single number of audio components .
We can do six and a half million different combinations using the components that there are only in one store store .
You have to admit that there 's a lot of choice .
Other trade : the world of communications .
I was once , when I was a kid , you could get all the phone services , to bad at the moment that were provide mom Bell .
And he was doing this , you know , you didn 't buy it .
A consequence of that , between the phone , was that the phone never break .
These days are gone .
Now we have a variety of phones , especially amazing phones , especially among the cell .
Here 's the cell phones of the future .
My favorite preferred is in the middle , MP3 , cut , and the blue for the crash .
If you don 't see it in the store in the store , you 're going to be in the end , you 're going to be going to be able to get .
And what happens is that people enters to go in the strokes and he 's doing this question . And you know , what 's the answer is ? The answer is , " No . "
It 's not possible to buy a cell phone that doesn 't do too many things .
So , in other aspects of life that are much more important than buists , you verge the same choices of choices .
Auseence healthcare : it 's not happening in the United States that you go on the doctor and the doctor , you know what you have to do .
Instead , walk from the doctor , and doctor says , " OK , we might do A , or B , " A has these benefits and these risks and these risks , " B has these benefits and these risks . What do you do ? "
You say , " Dror , what would I do ? "
And the doctor says , " A has these benefits and these risks and B , and B has these benefits and these risks . "
" What do you want to do ? "
And you rebate , " Dror if she was me , what would do ? "
And the doctor , " But I 'm not she . "
And the result of the result of the malth , expression that makes it looks like a great thing .
But it 's actually not that a moment is that a slide and responsibility to make decisions that someone knows , to somebody else knows -- and it 's not -- and it 's almost certainly maled -- and so it 's not in the ideal condition to take .
There 's a huge marketing of pharmaceutical products , direct to people like me and you , that if you think about it doesn 't have any sense , because we can 't buy them .
But if we can 't buy them , why do they publishing them ?
The answer is that they want to be that doctor for asking for for for us to do it .
Something that is that 's our horse is a question of , how do we see in this vigness . " We don 't want to force the children . " We don 't want to force their sex at the right time . " We have to make it .
And we can reinvent how many times we do .
which means that every morning , at the rising , you have to decide that kind of person wants to be .
I spect the family and marriage , a time , a time common , a common , unhappy , almost for anyone , it was that marriage , and he was that you get the most price possible , and he started to make the early possible .
The only real choice was to choice was with who , not when , and not even what to do after .
And the day , all , all of that 's really to play .
I teach a very smart students , and I do 20 percent of work than a time .
And not because they 're less bright , not because they are less diligent .
I 'm just because I 'm impensiered , I 'm asking , " Would I be married , or I should I do that now ? "
" Would I marry later ? " I have to think about before the fear ? "
I 'm interrogative interrogative .
And they try to answer these questions , even though this implies , even though that 's not to get a beautiful vote to my examples .
And they really have to do it . They are important questions .
Now , the work : we 're lucky , like Carl underestineated , because the technology allows us to work every day , every day , from every corner of the planet , except that the Hotel Randolp-.
In the way , there 's a corners , and I don 't tell you that , where the WiFi WiFi works .
I don 't tell you , because I want to use it .
What does this incredible freedom of choice we have about work ? It 's that we have to keep in work ? It 's that we 've been doing , by continuously , if we have to work or not .
We can go to see our son playing hot , with the cell phone in a tank , Blackberry in the other , and the notea books .
And even though they 're all spent , every minute that we see our son , we 're also wondering , " Do I have to say , " Do you say to this call ? "
" I have to say to this email ? " I have to habe this letter ? "
And even when the answer is no , " all of this makes the experience of your child very different from what would be in other conditions .
So , from any part of the look , and the big things , big , and the things of life , life is a question of choices and life , is a question of choices .
And once the world was this : that 's what is : that 's not about it . But it 's not about a question of choice .
The world today is this is this : The dilemma is , " Is it a positive , or negative ? "
The answer is , I think , we 're going to be in the way ,
We all sorts of the slightly , so I 'm going to talk about those negative ones .
All of this choice company two negative effects on people .
The first one , paradoxally , is that produces instead of paralysis that produces instead of liberation .
With a lot of options in which choose to choose , becomes very hard to do .
I give you an example of a significant study , a conduct on flying plans .
A my colleaged , a giant society data , the giant society of funds , with about a million clients have been in 2,000 different companies .
What she 's discovered is that for every 10 solutions that are being offed in more , the percentage of two percent .
With 50 funds , there 's 10 percent of adesions , there 's a 10 percent of it 's only five percent of them ?
Because with 50 funds of whom choose , is sically hard to decide , and the choice is to stay ink up to the inquestions .
And I 'm asking questions , and questions , questions , and questions , and of course , and questions never comes to .
You know that doesn 't mean only that these works are going to be lators for dogs because they 're not going to say that the decision is so ostics that they lose the decision is so hostics that they lose the funds of the work .
Don 't participating , they 're losing to five dollars for the dator of work , which would be well to be really threshold .
So , the paralysis a consequence of having too many choices .
And I think it 's going to make the world like this .
" And finally , for the laby : ketchup , senaps , or maionese ? "
You want to take the right decision , if it 's for eternity , right ?
You don 't want to choose bottom , and you don 't want to choose the wrong source .
So this is the first effect . The second is that we can avoid the paralysis , and we can do a choice , finally , we 're less satisfied from the result of how we would be would be with less options than than we would choose .
And that 's for different reasons .
One of these is that with many confments between which choose , if you buy one and it 's not perfect , it 's very easy to imagine you that you could make a different choice that would be better . And what 's happens is better . And what 's happens is better . And what 's happens is that the alternative imagined us . And what 's going on is that the resputting the decision is presents to the decision ,
even when it was a good decision .
The other choices there are , easier , the easier is easy to be insod-insod-called option .
And there is what economic economists call constood called constood .
Dan Gilbert asked very well as a value that we have to do things about what we compare the things that we compare .
In the rest , when there are a lot of options , it 's easy to represent the characteristics of the options of the option of the option that 's choice .
Here 's an example . I school with all the ones that are not in New York York .
But that 's what probably think .
There 's this couple in Hamptons .
A place of lurther .
Samdid . Oten days . It 's all for them .
I don 't miss . But what he thinks is , " Well , sick , it 's Aggosts . "
" All my neighbors in Manhattan is away . "
" I could just talk about front in front of home . "
And it spend two weeks , from the idea that 's losing -- every day -- the possibility of parking where it wants .
The constood decreases the satisfy for what we have , even when the choice choice was excellent .
And the more is the options that we have to look at , the more than the characteristics .
Here 's another example .
This is a vignize a lot of things .
It 's about living the moment , and maybe living slowly .
But the most important point is that anything you do , you know , you choose to do , you don 't do the other .
The things that we don 't choose are not to choose , they can make less attractive what we do .
Third point : : it 's growing growing expectations .
I tried it on my skin bought a new couple of jeans .
I 'm almost always jeans .
Once the jeans were just a type , buy them and bought them from the bestia , they were dissive , just after they took them a life and work and jeans , they started to go .
So , I went to buy a new when the old ones were gone , and I said , " I need a couple of jeans , this is my cutter . "
And he said , " He wants to me , " Heasy fit , " As it relaxed ? "
He wants to do it with the cernights or the buttons ? "
" Do you want to strapped ? "
" Soting them wants to large , and the blah , " Continuate elencare . "
I was slamed , and after a while I was able to say , " I want the guy who was the only kind of , " I want to be the only kind of , so for a time , I tried to all the jeans , and then came out of the jeans , and then came out of the jeans , and I 'd come out of the jeans , with the best cost of jeans that I 've ever had .
It was the massive . I had got the best choice .
But I felt worse .
Why ? I wrote a book to understand it .
The reason I was worse about is that with all the exciting of my expectations were high , jeans had to be perfect .
I started expectations , I didn 't expect . I didn 't expect anything excited when there only existed one kind of a kind of like , but when it 's been 100 different , at least , at least one guy had to be perfect .
What I had was buy , but I didn 't perfect .
After I had compared that choices to what I was trying to do in compare to expectations .
The addition of options in life does not make people that make to increase the expectations that these have respect to the options of the same .
And that 's going to produce less satisfy , even when the results are good .
Nobody in the world 's world 's marketing , if you realize it .
Because if you know , you wouldn 't know what I 'm talking about .
And the truth more like this .
" You 'd better when he was worse , " The reason he was worse , " The reason he was worse when you were worse , he was worse , you could meet against the pleasure .
And the world we live in -- opulents , in the world we live citizens with the expectancy of perfeature -- the massive we can hope is that things are at the altitude of expectations .
You never surprised , because your expectations , because your expectations , my expectations , they 're ingiant .
The secret of happiness -- what you 're here -- is , " Basse expectation , " Yes , wanting . "
I mean , a little autobiographical moment -- which I 'm really mared and my wife is really amazing .
I couldn 't have to do better , I couldn 't have to do better ,
But that 's not always a good thing .
And finally , a consequence of jeans in discople when there 's only that you 're not satisfacts , and you ask you , " Why ? "
" Who 's responsible ? " The answer is clear .
The world is responsible . What can I do ?
When there are hundreds of jeans , and buy a jeans , and you buy who 's responsible , and you ask you who is responsible , it 's as a closed responsible ,
You might have better .
With hundreds of available , there are no excuses for the insuccess .
So when people take decisions , even if the result is go , they feel , they 're sitting and give the colors to hold them .
In the last few years , the depression of the industrialized world .
I think a significant factor -- not the only , but important -- of this is that I think of wave is just that people have deludgly deludent because the standards are too high .
And when they have to explain this situation think that colputs is them .
So the end result is that we 're better , in general , we 're better , but we feel worse .
Let me remember .
This is the official dogma , what we all take for good and it 's completely fake . It 's not true .
There 's no doubt that a little bit of choice is better than haven 't at at at all but that 's not to do a lot of choice is better than it .
There 's a critical value . I don 't know what it is .
But I 'm sure that we 've been played by a piece of the level where the choices are improve our life .
Now , from a political point -- I 've almost finished -- from political point of view , the political nocycle is the following .
What 's allows you all of this choice in industrial societies is the material .
There are many places in the world , and you 've got a lot of places in the world , and you know , where the problem is not they have too much choice .
The problem is that they have too a little bit of them .
So the face that I 'm talking about is a while the modern exclusive of modern , rich societies .
And what he 's doing is this : Steve Levitt talked about how much those expensive and discovered you to tell how those expensive expensive constomists to boys are inushed .
I mean these choices , complicated and dispendious , it 's not just that they 're useful .
I 'm going to say of a lot of them .
They get worse .
If a little bit of what in our societies are allows choice was reversed in where people have too few possibilities , it would not be better to improve , but we also have our life .
This is what economists call a parety-improving .
A redistribution of the income is good to everyone -- not just to the poor -- because of this choice , in a way that comes back .
For conclude , " You can become everything that you want , "
You , you know , people are , you think , " What does that fish ? "
" It 's obvious that you can 't make it in a glass . "
" A castrated imagination , a limited vision of the world --
and I 'm like that , I 've interpreted it , at the beginning .
But then , think , instead , I realized that that fish the long-term .
Because the reality of fact , it 's that if you send me in frantum , " that 's all possible . "
If you break the boat so that everything can decrease can decrease .
You 're going to get the paralysis , and you 'll reducing the well-being .
Everybody needs a sphere .
This is almost certainly too , maybe for the fish , and certainly for us .
But the absence of some symbolic sphere is a recipe for flels and , for the roina .
Thank you very much .
