A few years ago , here at TED , Peter Skillman introduced a challenge of designing challenge .
And the idea is very simple .
Four , four people have to build the highest tower , you can stand up by using 20 spaghetti saus , using 20 spaghetti , a meter of a spneedle , a meter of shmallow .
The marshmallow has to be blue in the top of the tower .
And , even though , it looks very simple , it 's quite hard , because it costs people to collaborate very rapidly .
So I thought it was an interesting idea , and I started it into a laboratory on design .
And it was a huge success .
And since then , I organized about 70 laborators of this kind of around the world with students , designers and architects , even the development of Fortune companies and 50 .
There is something in this exercise that reveals the important lessons about the nature of collaboration , and I would share some of these lessons with you .
Normally , most people starts with Eastern to be done .
They talk about , they 're looking at the power , then they compete for the power , then they spend time planning , organizing .
They have the sketches and predict the spaghers .
They take the most of the time to disposition , assembling the spaghetti sauce into growing growing structures and , right when the time is going to go down , somebody out the marshmallow , and caught it on the summit , they do a step back and Ta-up .
They mit the work .
But what happens is , most of the time , is that the " Ta-from " is " transform in a Uh-oh , " because the weight of the marshmallow makes collapse and collapse the whole structure .
There 's a number of people who have a lot more uh-oh moments , and there are the worst of people , and in the worst of business .
They put out , they cheat , and they 're destract , and they create structures .
And there are some of course , groups that have a lot more tails , and in the best ones , there are the neodiplomers of childhood schools .
And it 's amazing .
As Peter says , not only create the higher structures , but they 're the most interesting structures .
And your question is , how is it possible ? Why ? What do they do they do ?
And Peter said that , " No one of the kids spent time trying to become the director of SpA . " Right . "
They don 't spend time competing for power .
But there 's another reason .
And the reason is that the economy students are formed to find the single best project .
And then I 'm going to do that .
And after , what happens is that when they put the marshmallow in the top , they don 't have time , and what happens ?
The crisis .
Is you familiar ? Right .
What children do differently , is that they start from the marshmallow , and they build prototypes , one after the other tening , and then they all over the marshmallow , they have different possibilities of the long train the marshmallow .
designers recognize that this kind of collaboration is the essence of an iterative process .
And with every version , children have a instantaneous instantaneous feedback on what it doesn 't work .
So the ability to work on prototypes is essential , but we see how they work different groups .
The average for most people is about 50 centriers , for the students of economy , about half , adults , a little bit better , but not very , children , better than many adults .
Who does better than everybody ?
Architects and engineers , thank you .
99 cm is the highest structure that I 've ever seen .
And why ? Because they understand that the triangles and geometrical models are the key to to build stable to build structures .
Then we have the general directors , a little bit better than average .
But this is where it becomes interesting .
If you include a delegate administrator , the group can do a lot better .
It 's unbelievable . It 's a little bit of a , you 're looking at " Vedrai that the group will win an anticipate . And why ?
because they 're particularly accomplished accomplish work .
They understand the process , they understand it .
And all of the groups that they 're paying attention to work .
You know , special , and you know , their combination , and their combination to a safe .
If you have 10 groups that they usually work , maybe you 're going to get structures that are structures that are standing up .
And I tried an interesting experiment .
I thought , let 's get the major for a time .
I put up the 10,000000-dollar team .
What do you think that happened to design students ?
What was the result ?
Here 's what happened .
No one of the team has created a stable structure .
If one of them had built a 2.5 centers , it would bring the prize .
Isn 't it interesting that a high-scale impact .
We 've tried again the exercise with the same students .
What do you think happened ?
Now they got the value of a prototype .
The same team , from the worst .
They created the highest structure in the minor time .
So , they 're important lessons about incentives and success . Could you say , why do someone should spend the time writing a marshmallow ?
The reason is this : helping to create digital tools and processes to help groups , video games and visual effects .
And what it does a marshmallow is to help identify identify assumption .
Why is , honestly , every project has his marshmallow , isn 't that ?
The challenge provides a sharing experience , a common language , a common position to build a prototype .
And so , this is the value of the experience , of this simple exercise .
And those of you who were interested , it can go to the marshmallow-challenges .
It 's a blog that you can take a look at how to build the marshmallow .
There are step instructions for pass .
There are crazy examples from all over the world on how people correges and add the system .
There 's also the world record .
And the most important lesson , I think , is that design is really a sports of contact .
So , he required the employees of all of the senses , and the most fines , the feelings and manuality to run the challenge that you have in hand .
And sometimes , a little prototype of this experience is what you need to transform a moment , " uh-oh " in a moment . "
And that can really make a difference .
Thank you very much .
We end up having a car here , great , beautiful , in the TED weighs , it 's a very good time machine .
Everybody in this room have to come in .
You can go back , you can 't go back ; you can 't remain where you 're .
And I would be curious to know what you would choose because I asked him to my friends in the last days , and everybody wants to go back .
I don 't know . They want to come back to the first one that there were the car or Twitter , or the American Idol .
I don 't know .
I believe that there is a kind of return to the nostalgia , and illusions .
I understand it .
But I don 't make that group , I have to admit .
I don 't want to go back , and why I 'm not going to go back , it 's because the chances on this planet are not going to go back , go on this planet .
So I want to go into the machine and I want to go on .
This is the best period that there was on this planet in every field that we can measure : health , wealth , mobility , opportunity , calculus of disease .
There was never a time like this .
My dy-grandparents died , all the first 60 years .
My grandparents were pushed that number to 70 .
My parents are to touch the 80 .
So it 's better that there 's a nine at the beginning of my death .
But it 's not only about people like us , it 's a much bigger than this .
A born child in New Delhi can expect to live as much as the rich man in 100 years ago .
Think about it . It 's an amazing thing .
How does that be true ?
Vaix . The smallpox killed billions of people on this planet .
It has changed the demography as no war has ever done .
If you went to . Sdry .
We have a confit . It can .
In the rich world , diseases that threatening millions of people one generation is no longer exist , basically .
Difterms , rosolia , polio --
someone knows what are they going to be ?
Vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feeding billions of people , these are triumphers of the scientific method .
And I think , the scientific method , to try things , see if they work , changing them when they don 't work , is one of the great results of humanity .
These were good news .
Unfortunately , they were the good news because there are other problems , and there are other problems , and they 've been quoted , for example one of them is that , although everything we got , a billion people in bed in bed in the planet , every day .
This number is growing , with incredible rapidity , and it 's true .
And not only , we used our creativity to fill to fill the planet .
Acqua points , farm land , rainforests , oil , natural gas , they 're disappearing , and if we 're not going to be disappeared , and if we don 't stand our actions to pull us out of this trouble .
So the question is , can we do that ? I think yes .
I think it 's clear that it 's possible to produce billions of people without violating the land that they live on .
I think it 's possible to do this world of energy without this destroy .
I really think , and no , and no , it 's not illusion .
But here 's the thing that keeps me up at night -- one of the things that keeping me up at night .
We 've never had so need to scientific progress , as we need now , and we 've never been in the position to use them at the best of how we might be used to use them as we could today .
We 're at an incredible events , really , really , in a lot of ambition .
But despite this , I think we should go back centuries , 300 years earlier Illuminism , to find a time in which we 've been fight , a time in which we 've been fight , most vigorosly in the front of how we do now .
People intrapes in what they believe , and they do it with a lot of force that we can 't get rid of them .
In even the truth , you know .
Listen , everybody 's right to their own opinion ; they also have right to their opinion to the progress , but you know what you don 't have it right ?
You don 't have any right to your facts . I 'm sorry , you can 't .
I put it a little bit about it .
A decade of years ago , I wrote a story on the vaccines for " The New Yorker , a brief article .
And I was studied that someone had opponed , which is , after all , which is , after all , the most effective public health care of all the human history .
So I didn 't know what to do , so I did not know what to do , so I wrote the story , and I spent the story .
Not much later , I wrote a story about genetically modified food .
Same thing , only bigger .
People were slamed .
So I wrote a story about that , and I couldn 't understand why the people would be considered the OGM as " I 'm going to move the molecules in a specific way , instead of case , it was invading the molecules , instead of allowed nature .
But , I always wrote my work . I wrote the story and I went on .
I mean , I 'm a journalist : we write , let 's go to dinner , end up there .
But these stories from me , and I couldn 't understand why , but at the end .
The problem was that those phananem that they were not provided to me , they were not provided .
They were instruck people in consciousness , education , people for good .
They were exactly like people in this room .
And the thing that was very --
but then I thought , from , we have to be honest ; we 're at a point on this planet , where we don 't have the same relationship to the progress that there was a time .
We talk about the environment .
We 're talking to the ironic with virgolette , using virgolette , " You know , well , there are motivated to do it , and I think we know what they are .
We lost trust in institutions , in the authority , and sometimes in science itself , and it 's comprehensible to it .
It 's just to do a few names and people understand .
Sernobyl , Bhopal , the Challer , Vioxx , mass destruction , mass destruction instruction .
I mean , every one has his list .
We have questions and problems that we were always right .
So you 're going to be .
You know , you pretend , you pretend , you pretend .
Don 't do anything for granted .
But here 's the fundamental point : when you have to accept them , and we 're not very good at this .
And I think that 's why we 're in an epidemic of fear that I had never seen and I hope you never seen .
About 12 years ago , a story , a horrible story , which was a legacy story , that had a bond between autism and vaccines versus , paroted and rosolia .
Very frightening .
Thanks were made to see whether it was true .
And you had to do hundreds of studies ; it 's a important issue .
And then they got the data .
And they came from the United States , from the Sweden , from Sweden , from Canada , and everybody was equal , no connection , no correlation , nothing .
It didn 't make a difference . He didn 't make it a difference because we believe the anecdots , to what we think of , what we think of what we think is real real .
We don 't believe a pile of documents from employees of government that show us numbers , and I understand it , I think we all understand it .
But you know what ?
The results have been devastating --
It 's devastating because this is a fact : the United States is one of the world in which the number of vaccines against deployed .
It 's horrible , and we should be true of ourselves .
It 's terrible .
What happened that happened to do you do something like this ?
Now , I realize it . I really understand it .
Think of it , someone here has the morbill ?
Do anyone in the audience has ever seen a person die of death ?
It doesn 't happen .
In this country doesn 't happen , but it happened 160,000 times in the world last year .
I 'm a little bit of deaths for deaths , 20 every hour .
But because it didn 't happen here , we can take away from the head , and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around to disappears , and ignorance from palcoscenic like Oprah Larry King Live .
And they can do it because they don 't understand the difference between causality and correlation .
They don 't understand that these two things seem like equal , but they 're not almost ever .
But it 's something that we have to learn , and we have to learn it quickly .
This man was a hero , Jonas Salk .
He liberated the humanity from one of his worst flags .
Not a fear , no suffering -- the polio , clean .
The man in the middle , not as much .
It 's called Paul Offit .
He just created a vaccine against the rotable with other people .
It saved 400 , 500 children every year in the developing world .
It 's bad , right ?
It 's opinion , if Paul goes around to talk about vaccines , says how precious they are and that people should simply stop and that people should simply stop .
And he says it in these terms .
So Paul considered a terrorist .
When Paul talked in a public office can 't testimoned without a submit .
They call it home because to some likely to remind them that knows where his children go to school .
Why ? Because Paul created a vaccine .
I don 't need to tell that , but the vaccines are fundamental .
If we can take them , the illnesses come back , terrible disease , and it 's going on .
We have again again the morbill in this country .
And it 's going to be worse , and between not very much the children will start to die of new because it 's just a lot of numbers .
And they 're not going to die bills .
The polio ? To you also take that . Why not ?
One of my ex colleagues , he wrote a couple of weeks ago and told me that it was a little bit about it .
Nobody told me that before .
She wouldn 't vaccinate his son against the polio .
Neeven dead .
OK .
Why ? Because there is no polio from us . But you know what ?
We didn 't have the polio in the United States .
And I don 't know -- maybe store a guy is sitting on an airplane in Lagos and he 's coming to Lagos Angeles , and he 's coming to Los Angeles , now it 's over the Ohio .
Maybe land in a couple of hours , which is going to be a machine , it 's going to get here in Long Beach and staser participate from TED .
He doesn 't know it 's not been infected by a paralyzed disease , and we don 't know it because that 's how the world works .
This is the planet that we live in . We don 't do the end that 's not that .
We love it .
Everybody took the vitamines ?
Echink , a little bit of antioxes to begin the day .
I know you 've done it because half of Americans do it every day .
They take that stuff , as they take that stuff , how they do it to the alternative medicine , and we don 't care about how we 're unuseful .
The data will always demonstrate it .
They have the more scure urin it . They have not , almost ever .
But you want to spend 28 billion dollars for urin scture , I 'm with you !
Urina scture . Sure .
Why do we do that ? Why do we do that ?
I think of , I think , we hate the big drug houses .
We go to the great government machine . We don 't trust .
And we do good . Our health system does slavery .
It 's cruel to millions of people .
It 's absolutely cold , incredibly cold and demoralizing for those of us that they can afford it .
So , do we go down , and who do we refugee ?
We 're up between the big placebo arms .
It 's fantastic . We love the big placebo .
You know , it 's a serious problem because this stuff is a slavery , and we spend billions of dollars .
I have a whole series of examples here .
Nobody of these -- ginkgo -- a frod , echink -- a frog -- I don 't know what it is , but I don 't know what it is , but we spend billions of dollars , and it 's a frog .
You know , what ? When I say these things , people come to me against , and they say , " What are you interested in ? Lass that people do what you want .
It makes them good . "
Do you gue a little ? You 're going to go back .
Because I don 't care about whether it is the secretary of the Salute and the Uhhands to say , " Uhm , I don 't have to listen to the evidence of the experts of mammography , " or if it says a few longer that it wants to treat patients .
When we put the street the street that brings to replace science and proves with magic and tradition , we 're not going to be .
We don 't like Thabo Mbeki in South Africa .
It killed 400 miles of his conception , continuing to say that barbabietery , cut up , and the next one of the anti-retroviral drugs that we can slow down the AIDS .
Hundreds of thousands of unuseful deaths in a country that has been hit more than any other from this disease .
Please , you don 't get to tell me that there are not consequences for these actions .
There are always there .
Now , the most stupid epidemic that we 're in the middle right now is the war in between sustaff of genetically modified by genetically modified and the elite food of biological food .
It 's an idit diatriba . It 's got to end .
It 's a diatriba on words , on metaphors .
It 's ideology , it 's not science .
Every single thing that we eat , every one of the rewards , every conveils of prezzing , every horse of Bruxelles has been modified by the man .
You see , there were no send in the garden of Eden .
There were no melanzane .
There were no Christmas trees . We 've created us .
We 've done this in the last 10,000 years .
Something has worked and something else not .
And we elected what we didn 't work .
Now we can do this more precise .
And there are risks , of course , there are .
But we can put things like the A vitamin the rice , and this would help millions of people , to take a millions of people , prolunning their life .
Do we want to do that ?
I have to tell you , I don 't understand it .
We 're contrary to the OGM .
Why ?
And the things that I always feel like is , too many chemists , pesticide , ormons , hormones , we don 't want to enormous farmed with the same thing , it 's wrong .
We don 't want the companies to put a little bit about life .
We don 't want the companies are unique .
You know what my response to this ?
It 's yes . We 're right . We do something .
It 's true , we have a huge food problem , but it 's not science .
It has nothing to do with science .
It 's law , morality , lines on the shapes .
You know that science is not a corporation .
It 's not a country .
It 's not even an idea ; it 's a process .
It 's a process , sometimes you know , it ’ s a process , but the idea that we shouldn 't afford to do his work because we have fear is actually very , very wired , and it 's taking a millions of people to prosperate .
You know , in the next 50 years , we 're going to be forced to produce 70 percent of food in more than we do now , 70 percent .
These are the investments in the last 30 years .
Vergognose . Virgognose .
They need it and we don 't need it .
Why ? Him modified .
We don 't want to encouraging people to eat slavery as well .
I see a billion people eat eat .
It looks a little like a little bit .
But it 's just provided calories . It 's a slavery .
It doesn 't have nutrients , it doesn 't have any nutrients , but scientists are finding the way of put in this moment .
So many people eating and running less the risk of becoming blind .
They won 't die , and you know what ?
It would be very nice . It would not be a luxury restaurant , but it would be very beautiful .
I just ask myself , why are we against ?
I mean , let 's tell you , why are we hurt this thing ?
Just why don 't we want to move the genes and there ?
It 's about moving genes . It 's not about chemicals .
It 's not about our ridiculous oxxxusion , or our desire to have greater , better food .
There is no Rice Krispies .
It 's about saving the life of the people 's life , and this is now that we began to understand what it means .
Why -- you want to know it ? -- if we don 't understand it , and we continue to behavior as we 're going to be hurt something which I don 't think we want to eat something which I don 't think we want to eat it , technological coloniogical colonialism .
There 's no other way to describe what 's going on .
It 's egost , it 's horrible , and we have to stop it .
So , after this conversation conversation , you could ask me , " You still want to go to this ridiculous time machine and go to the future ? "
Of course , I want .
It 's stuck on the present now , but we have an incredible opportunity .
We can deal with the time machine as we want .
We have the chance to go where we want , and we 're going to do it where we want .
We 've got to do these conversations , and we have to think , but when we go into the machine of time , and we 're going to be happy to do that .
I know we can and , as much , I think the world needs to have it right .
Thank you .
Thank you .
And one day , the Los Angeles Times Steve Los Steve Lopez Angeles Times Los Angeles when he heard a beautiful music music .
It was coming from a man , a man , an a-American man , fascinating , with the husbed traits , without dimora , which was playing a violin that he had only two cords .
I 'm telling a story that a lot of you know , because Steve articles from the basis of a book , which , in the followed , came adapted to the great screen , with Robert Downey Jams , who interpret the part of the Lopez , and Jamie Foxy in the part of Nathony Ayers , and Jamie Foxy Ayers , which was interrying to the Juilliard .
Nathaniel this Juilliard , had a terrible nervous exhausting , and 30 years later lived as a without Skid Row in the middle of Los Angeles in the middle of Los Angeles .
And all of you to read the book of Steve , or looking at the movie to understand not only the beautiful connection of these two men , you know .
I 'm Jane McGonigal . I 'm a video games .
I guess a 10 years old , and my goal for the next 10 is to try to save the world in the real life as it is to try to save the world the online .
So , I have a plan , and I consists in convincing people , including all of you , to spend more time to play play play games and most interesting .
So , we go to three billion hours a week by playing online .
Some of you may think , " It 's a good time to play . "
maybe too much time , considering how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
Actually , in my research , I pressed the Istitute for Future , actually is the contrary .
Three billions of week are not minimally enough to solve the world the most urgent issues in the world .
In fact , I think that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we have to increasing that digit .
I calculated that we need is 21 billion hours of game every week .
It 's probably an idea a controversial idea , so it 's probably a reforce , so the ripet .
If we want to solve problems that hunger , poverty , climate changes , global conflict changes , global conflict conflict , I think we have to have the environment to play online , at least 21 billion hours to seventh , for the next decade . No , I 'm really , really .
That 's why I think that I play is so important to play is to play is so important to survival of the human species . It 's true .
This is a portrait of the photographer Phil Toldan , he wanted to catch the emotion of the game .
So he photographed players as they players played .
And this is a game classic emotion .
If you 're not used to habitual players , you can lose some of this picture .
You probably noticing the sense of urgency , a little bit of fear , but it 's a very profound concentration , a very profound attention , a very profound attention , a very difficult problem .
If you 're habitual players , you 'll notice some details , the folds around the mouth , and around the mouth is a optimism of optimism .
And the daughter surprise .
This is an abitual player to a step from something called an Epica Victory .
Ah , it 's a term that you 've heard . OK .
So we have habitual players between us .
An victory is an extraordinary result that you don 't seem to you can 't get you to when you don 't get it .
It 's almost beyond the imagination of the imagination , and when you get a shock to find out what you 're really capable of . This is a epy witory .
This player is a pace step from a ep-wy-step step .
And this is the expression that we need to see about millions of rates in the world of millions of problems in the world , as we face the next hundred years .
Unfortunately , this is the expression that we see in the life of all days as we try to deal with the urgent problems .
This is the expression that I call . " I 'm not Brate . " And I 'm going to do it . You see that ? "
I 'm with the expression , " I 'm not Brrate . "
This is a great deal in my old neighborhood of Berkeley , California , where I did the PhD on why we 're more good at game in the game that in real life .
And this is a lot of a lot of habitual players : we feel that in reality .
And I don 't mean , " just as a successful thing , even though , it 's part of it , we get more results in the online .
But I mean , " good , " good , " in the sense of motivated , inspired to collaborate and cooperating .
And when we 're in a online world , I think that a lot of us become the best versions of the same , the most capable to help without predict , more capable to help to focus on a problem for all the time , to get up after a failure and try it again .
And in real life , when we face a failure , when we face an obstacle , we often don 't feel anxious , we don 't feel anxious , you feel anxy , maybe depressed , frustrated or movie .
We never try to do these feelings while we 're doing , just not exist in a game .
So this is what I wanted to study at university .
What is it that in a game , we 're not going to get any result ?
How can we transport those feelings from games and applies them in the real world ?
So I studied games as World of Warcraft , which is really the ideal environment to solve problems in collaborative .
And I began to notice some things that make the epites so possible in online worlds .
The first one is that , when you look at one of these writing games , especially in World of Warcraft , there are a lot of different characters that are trusting a mission to save a mission to save the world .
But not a mission any : any perfectly open mission to your current level in the game . Right ?
So you can complete it .
They never give you an impossible challenge .
But it 's the bottom of your ability . So you 've got to do it seriously .
But there 's no disocks into the World of Warcraft , you don 't spend the time to turn to the pollyss , there 's always something to do .
And there 's a lot of collaborators .
Everywhere you go , hundreds of thousands of people , ready to join in a full of order to complete your mission .
It 's not something so common in real life , this feeling that we have a lot of collaborators .
And there 's this narrative , this narrative that inspire inspire , and what we 're doing .
And then we get all that positive feedback --
you 've heard about increasing level , and you know , one in intelligence .
We don 't get that kind of feedback in real life .
When I 'm going to leave this stage , we 're not going to talk about a public , and 1 in bizarre ideas .
I didn 't get that kind of feedback in real life .
Now , the problem of the online of collaborative environments as World of of Warcraft is that gives so much satisfaction is that it gives so much satisfaction , that we decide to spend all of the time in these game worlds .
It 's simply better than the reality .
And that 's why , I 'm going to now , collectively all the players of World of Warcraft have spent 593 million years of Azeroth problems .
This is not necessarily a negative thing .
But put it in perspective : 5.93 million years ago , it was the time that one of our ancestors stood up up .
That was the first first walking .
OK , so when we talk about how long we 're investing in the play , the only manufactured to think about it , is to talk about the parlit of the human temples , which is an amazing thing , but also useful , because we 've discovered that that by passing all this time to play , , we 're changing what we 're able to play , and more heart .
This is true , I think .
So , you know , you know , this interesting statistics .
It was published recently from a researcher to Carnagie Mellon .
The typical young average today in a country with a strong culture of habitual players , will have spent 10,000 hours playing online , at 21 years old .
10,000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons .
First of all , for the children in the United States 10,0000-hours is the exact number of hours to go to school as indeed to the maturity if you 're all the days .
So we 've got a whole parallel of education , in which young people learn how to be players . They 're talking about how to be players .
And some of you will probably read the new Malcolm Gladwell , " Fuoriclasse . "
If you 've done that of his theory of success , the theory , the theory of 10,000 hours for success .
It 's founded on a very good research in cognition , which is that if we dediate 10,000 hours of the study that we 're going to be a genes in that age .
We 're going to be good at that something as the best people in the world .
So , what we have now is a whole generation of young people who are genes of the game .
So , the question is , " Exactly , what do they become good at these players ? "
because if we could figure out what it 's going to have a amount amount of human resources without precedented .
This is the number of people in the world at least an hour a day to play online .
These are our game genes .
500 million people who are extraordinary good -- in something .
And in the next decade , we 're going to have another billion players of habits that are extraordinarily good at that something .
If you already didn 't know it , this is what we expect : the video games industry is developing platforming platforms , which they work with the cell network , instead of the large-bandwidth , so that you know , in particular , China , Brazil , in particular , China , Brazil , pounds will be online .
It 's a billion player in the next decade .
This is going to take us to 1.5 billion players .
So I started thinking under what these games are transforming us into genes .
These are four aspects that I 've detected . The first one is a optimism .
OK . Think of it as a self-motivation .
A optimism is the wish to act immediately to deal with an obstacle , together with convinction of having a reasonable hope of success .
The habitual players always belief that a epic writing is possible and it 's worth to try it , and do it now .
Habitual players are not with your hands .
abitual players are virtuous in the tbeing a social robust .
There are a lot of interesting research that showing how we 're better with other people , after they played with them , even though they 've been brought us .
And the reason is that it takes a lot of confidence to play with someone : we trust to spend their time with us , which is going to deal with us , which is going to deal with the same goals , and that will remain up to the game .
So , to play together by building the bits of the confidence and cooperation .
And we really have the results that we really have more robust social relations .
I love it .
You know , there 's a reason for which the average World of Warcraft player of Warcraft player a week , almost a part-time job .
It 's because we know , as we 're playing , which we 're plenty to work hard , rather than relaxing , or losing time .
We know that we 're optimized , as a human being , to work soon something that has meant .
And the habitual players are disposed to work hard , if you 've assigned a job .
And finally , one meaning .
Habitual players love to be associated to be associated to planetary stories .
For example , a little information to help create a context .
You know all of Wikipedia , the greater world .
The second wiki bigger in the world , with almost 80,000 articles is the wiki of World of Warcraft . Five million people use it every month .
They have more information on the World of Warcraft in the Internet , which on any other wiki in any other wiki in the world .
They 're building a ep-the-boundary .
They 're building a source of the World of Warcraft .
OK , these are the four superpoterms that together a single thing .
Habitual players are individuals of great optimism doctors .
These are people who believe that they 're individually able to change the world .
The only problem is that they believe we can change virtual worlds , but not the real real .
This is the problem I 'm trying to solve .
There 's an economic named Edward Castronova .
Her studies are brilliant . It 's studying the reason why people invested so much time , energy and money , in the online worlds .
And he said , " We 're looking at what it costs anything less a mass extense towards virtual worlds and environments . "
And it 's a econom , so it 's rational , and it says -- not as me , I 'm an exuberant --
But he says that this is a perfectly feeling , because the habitual players can get more in the online worlds that in real life .
They can have more solid social relations in a game that doesn 't in real life .
They have a better feedback , and they feel more reward in a game that doesn 't in real life .
So , in fact , for right now , it 's perfectly reasonable for the players , to spend more time in virtual worlds that I agree that this is reasonable , for now , but it 's not , in any way , an ideal way . We have to begin to make the real world more like a game .
This is inspiration from something that happened to 500 years ago .
These are dades , of course , peculiar of pecorders . Before we have joysticks , and they were the first instruments that we have the first instruments from game that we 've done by humanity .
If you know , you know , you know , Erodote , Erodote , maybe you know this story .
It 's the story of who invented games and why .
And I rodote ntowns , particularly , the dades games were invented in the world of Like , during a a carpet time .
It turns out that pathy was so several , that the king of the Like of Lidia decided to do something unlikely .
People suffered , the population was at ripped , was an extreme situation , they needed an extreme solution .
So , second Erodote , invented games , they were invented a valid law for all the realm .
One day , everybody would eat .
The next day , everybody would play .
And they immersed so deeply in the dades games , from the moment to play is so involved , and they diving us in a jewelry , and they immerged us in a jewelry .
And so one day they played , and one day they ate .
And second Erodote , they 're going to have this 18 years , surviving to the pain .
I think this is exactly the way we use games a day of the day .
We use games to fix the games of the real world 's suffering .
We use the games to move away from everything that doesn 't work in our real environment , from all that it doesn 't satisfacing us , and we get what we need from games .
But we don 't have to stop here .
This is really interesting : Second Erodote , after 18 years , the painting didn 't talk about it , so it was going to play a final party .
And they were the whole realm of the half , they played a dades , and the winers of that participated the game participated to an adventure .
And they went to a Lidia and they went to try to a new land , where to live , and they just behind the number of people to survive with resources available resources , with hope to bring their civilization from some other side , where they could prosperse .
It 's a little bizarre , right ?
But it recently , studies on the DNA have revealed that the Etrusks that they would take the same DNA of the ancient people in the same DNA of the anti-habitants of Like .
So , recently , scientists have suggested that history from Erodote is a real story .
And geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that was almost 20 years old , and it could explain the pathway .
So this incredible story could be true : could have actually saved their culture by playing , refugee in order for 18 years , refugee for 18 years , so inspired , and to know how to come to come up with the point to save the point to save the whole civilization .
OK , we can do it .
Let 's go to the World of Warcraft from 1994 .
It was the first strategy in real time of World of Warcraft . This 16 years ago .
They played for 18 years , we played in Warcraft for 16 years .
I say , we 're ready for our game .
They would half the world 's population for a new world .
It 's where I tragd the idea of 21 billion hours of play a week .
We know that half of us , you know , you know , to go a day to play a day , to when we don 't solve the real world problems .
Imagine what you 're going to ask , " How do we solve the real world problems in a game ? " Well , this is what I 've dedicated my work during last last years , I pressed Istitute for Future .
In our offices of Palo Alto have this stay that we express our idea of how we should relate to how we should relate to the future .
We don 't want to predict the future .
What we want to do is -- the future .
We want to imagine the scenarians from the best results , and then we want to give people to transform them concrete .
We want to imagine writing witories to give people the instruments to make them .
I 'm going to show you three games that I realized and I 'm a attempt to give people to create the epic wle-witories in their future .
This is " Mr. "
We did this game in 2007 .
It 's an online game in which you 're trying to survive a charge of oil .
It 's not real , but we published enough , but we published enough material online to believe that it is , and to make real life life as if we were in a sign . So , when you go into the game , you 're working on the game , it gives you news , and it gives you the news video that are not available , the impact on the distribution of oil , the things that are not available , the impact on the distribution of the oil distribution of oil ,
the impact on transport , if the schools are chiuses , and if you have to think of how you live , and you have to think of how you live in your life , if this is real .
We had this game with 1,700007 players in 2007 , and we looked at them from that for the three years , and what I can tell you is that it 's a transform .
Nobody wants to change the way they live in because it 's a good thing for the world or because it 's a good thing for the world or because it 's a need to do it .
But if you dive them in an adventture and say , " We don 't have oil .
This is an incredible story ! One adventure that you can participate it !
Sphysical to see how you survive as a survive . "
Most of our players and then habits that has learned in the game .
So , for the next game , I wanted to save the world , we decided to get higher , at a bigger problem for oil .
We did a game called Superstruct , at the Istitute for the Future , and premise it was a supercomputer that humanity has only only been 23 years on this planet .
The supercomputer is called " System HAllert of the Global Estinition . " Obviously . "
We asked people to reach online almost as in a Jerry Bruckheimer .
Jerry movies of Jerry Bruckheimer , provided a team : there is an astronautonautony , scientists , and they all have something to do to save the world , but in our game , instead of having only five people in the team from the team , but in our game , instead of course , and it 's done part of the world , and it 's done your inventing future of energy , the future of security , and the future of the future of the security and the future of several sesecurity .
8,000 people have played for eight weeks , have generated 500 solutions that you can find if you go online , and you 're trying to Google " Superstruct . "
And finally , the last game , it 's going to begin to three . This is a game made with the Istitute of the World Bank .
If you complete the game you 're going to be certified by the Istitute of the World Bank , like the Social Innovator , class of 2010 .
Lavoring with university disappears for sub-Saharan Africa , we 're invited to learn the techniques of social innovation .
There 's a story to comics , and it increases , thank you very much as a local knowledge , sustainability , imagination and invent .
So , I 'm going to invite all of you to share this game with young , everywhere in the world , particularly in the developing areas , which might be to get benefully to begin to imagining the world .
It 's now to conclude .
I want to ask a question .
What do you think that 's going to happen ?
We have all of these incredible players , we have these games that are pilots of things that we could do , but no one of these has still saved the real world .
Well , I hope that you agree with me that the habitual players are a human resource that we can use to do in the real world , that games are a powerful platform for the change , that we have these incredible superpowers , a game productivity , which is tiny plant , the ability to be a joyment , this optimism , this optimism optimism , this optimises of a meant .
And I really hope that we can come up to play games to play games that have important , to survive this planet for another century , and my hope is that that you can join me to do and participate to games like this .
When I look forward to the next decade , two things are certain : we can do anything that we can do that , and that we can play any future , and we can play whatever we want .
So , I say , we 're beginning to games that will change the world .
Thank you .
For some time , I was interested in placebo effect , it may seem a strange thing that a magician is that you don 't think about it from my point of view , which is something that is real . " In other words , " In other words , the sugar pills of sugar , sugar pills of sugar , the sugar pillar pills , only because the person thinks you think that you know , you know ,
that what 's going on is going to happen to a drug or something like that --
The therapy of the pain , for example , if they believe you have a measurable effect in the body called placebo effect .
Something becomes something true for perception that you have .
And I want to show you a magic rudimental trick , very easy .
And I 'm going to show you how it works . This is a trick that 's in all the books for children to fin the years of the daily years old .
I learned it from only Cub ScoMagic Scout Magic .
And so I 'm going to explain it for you and so I 'll explain it .
And so I 'm going to explain why I explain it .
Here 's what happens .
The hell , which you can examine ; my hand , you can examine .
And I 'll just just get the herself in my puzzy , like that .
I 'm handed on the manic .
I 'm sure to be sure that you have no or save from my manic manic .
And I 'm going to strings my wild like this .
And so you can see that something can go . So I 'm going to go here , nothing up here on or down from my manic manic .
And the purpose of this is simple .
I go to open my hand , and if it all happened to my hand , and if it all went well , my animal magnetism is going to be going to be a hell .
So , in fact , so I 'm hadn to his place that I can take it , and the colmer doesn 't falls .
Nothing goes up or my manic .
no trick . You can examinate anything .
Ta-da !
This is a trick that I often teach children .
that they 're interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about going to be studying this trick , even though it 's very simple .
Many of you in this room will know .
Here 's what Tengo on my hand .
I said , I said , I mean , my wildly .
to make sure that anything saving or from my manic manic , this is a lie .
The reason I 'm holding the wild is because this is the secret of illusion .
The moment that my hand is moving away from you , I 'm going to move away from you , this finger here , my index , in a position that was , in a position that was in a position that was in a position that was out in a position that was in a position where I was going to get away from that .
There is somebody who didn 't have a infancy here .
It 's like this , right .
And when I 'm walking around my finger ,
We can talk about why it 's the ingannevoles , because you don 't notice that there are three fingers here because the way , and the way that we 're going to do with information , not a one , two , three . Loook .
But it 's not the point . Right ? And when I open my hand , Obviously remains attacked not through the animal magnetism , but through the year , being , by being my index here .
And when I close my finger , the same thing , when I go back , this movement is the finger .
I 'm going to hold it . The hit off .
It 's a trick that you can do with your friends and close . Thank you .
Now , what does this have to do with placebo effect ?
I read a study , a year ago , a year ago I read this .
I 'm not a medical jobs or a researcher , so it was a surprising thing .
And it looks like a little bit of a gyle in the form of a white pill , as a white aspirine , just a white pill , just a white circulular , has a misurable effect .
But if you change the shape , and you give placebo , under a smaller of a smaller , and of blue blue , and you printing a letter is visual .
Even no one of the two drug has no drug -- they 're sugar pills .
But a white pill is not effective as a blue pill .
What ?
But anyway , it 's not where you 're going to end .
The capsus are more effective than shapes of every form .
A colored capsule , which is a part of one and red from the other is better than a white one is better than one .
The dosage has his role .
One pill two times a day is not so effective as three pills -- I don 't remember the statistics . I don 't remember the statistics .
But the point is --
that these dosages have a role .
And it also has a role .
And if you want the definitely to use a needle .
Right ? A syringe with something -- a couple of c.c.c.c.m.
you start in a patient --
This is a strongly image in their mind , much stronger than the white of the white pill .
It 's real , this graph -- I 'm going to show you another time when we 're going to have a slide .
The point is that the white pill is not effective like that blue is not effective as the capsule , which is not as a needed .
And nobody has pharmaceutical quality .
It 's just your believes that makes them real in your copro and strength the effect .
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and apply it to a magic trick .
And to do something that is a track and do it seem real .
And we know from that study when you want a effect you have to use the needle .
This is a seven inches of seven inches , Very appointing .
It 's a little sterilization .
This is my meat . This is not Damian .
This is my skin . This is not a special hollywodian effect .
I 'm going to huck my skin and go through this needed to the opposite part .
If you try to nausea -- if you know easily -- I did it for some friends in the albergo camera , the other night , and for some of you that I didn 't know , and a woman 's almost came up .
So if you tried to be easily , I suggested that you don 't look for the next 30-- in fact , you know , I 'm going to do the first part of the bad here .
You can see , you can look at another part .
Here 's what happens , right here , the beginning of my carne at the bottom of my arm , I just do a little hole .
I 'm going to take it up . To I 'm impressive ?
And now a little bit through my skin , and out the other side , like that .
Now , we 're in the same position that we were with the trick .
More or not you count my fingers now , right ?
So I 'm going to show you . Here 's one , two three , four , five . Yes , OK .
I know what people think about when you see this .
They think , " Surely it 's not going to be stupid to huck , just for a little bit of fun . "
So , let me let me leave you a sbird .
How does it look ? Actually .
Yes , I know , I know , I don 't have all right there . "
The people in rooms are coming in .
So let 's show up near .
This is really my skin . It 's not a special Hollywood special .
This is my meat , and I can turn it around .
Sorry , if you feel bad , you 're feeling , you don 't look .
People at the bottom , or they 're going to look at a few years old , " Well , it 's clear that you have a few effect , but if he was true .
you see there 's a hole here and a hole here , if it was true . "
Well , I 'm going to get out a bit of blood for you .
Here 's here .
Normally , I would hold the needle .
I could see my arm , and I would show you that there are no ference .
But I think in this context , and the idea of taking something that fake and turn it into something true , and I 'll leave it from the stage .
We 're going to see a several times in the next few days . So , thank you very much .
So , in my life , I met a lot of fish .
I 've only loved two .
The first one , it was more than one of a passionate story .
It was a beautiful weavor , carnose , carnose , adconsistent one of the most sold on the menu .
that fish !
What was even better , it was from a dotstandards of most elevated sustainability of environmental sustainability .
So , you feel like that it with the consciousness to sell it .
I was involved in a relationship with this beauty for different months .
And one day , the company of the company called me and asked me to talk to a dedicated event to an environmental sustainability of the farming .
" Of course , " I said . "
This was a company that he tried to solve what became an unimaginable problem for our chef .
How do we continue to have the fish in our menu ?
During the last 50 years , we weighed in the same way that we 've been sat the ground .
The destruction was tremendous .
90 percent of the big fish , the ones that like this so much the tons , the waves , the waves , the fish , the heavy , the fish have been reduced .
There 's no almost nothing .
So , we please , or less the acquiriculture , the heavium will become part of our future .
There 's a lot of contrary arguments .
Happy fish pollums , for the least , the least part of them , and they 're inefficient . Take the tune for example .
A big problem is that there 's a great deal with 15 to one .
This means that it takes 15 to wild fish to get a wild , to get a libaby ,
It 's not very sustainable .
And even the knowledge is not a big one .
So here 's then , finally there was a company that he tried to do this in the right way .
I wanted to help them .
The first day of the event , I call it the public public public public public facing company .
Let 's call it Don .
" Don " I said , " I said , " so you 're famous to do , you 're famous to do that far away . "
" Exact , " he said , " We 're so far from the coast that our shoes are diluon-focused , not focused . "
And then you add , " We 're basically a world . "
" The rate of conversion ? 2.5 to one said .
" The best sector in the sector . "
2.5 to one , fantastic .
" 2.5 to one thing ? What do you get to eat fish ? "
" sustainable Protein , he said .
" Great , " I said , " and I 'm going to ask the phone call .
And that night , I was in bed , I thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
So the next day , a few of the event , called the Don .
I said , " Don , are you going to make some sustainable examples ? "
He said he didn 't know it , and he would ask around .
Well , I talked to a little bit of people in the company , and no one severed response .
So , I 'm going to talk to the biologist .
We also call him him Don .
" Don , " I said , " Do you make me examples of sustainable ? "
Well , he mentioned a few em ems at the base of fishes and then said , " People . "
I said , " Do you know ? "
He said , " Yes , you think , skin , bones , waste , bones , sit , sitting and processed to eat me . "
I said , " What percentage of your eat is made of chicken ? "
I thought , say , two percent .
" Well , it 's about 30 percent said . "
And I said , " Don , what 's there that we sustainable to get the pollo to eat ? "
There was a long puses on the phone , and then he said , " There are too much in the world . "
I told you about this fish .
No , not because they 're one of those virtuous loving good food and traditional .
Well , to say the truth are .
No , in fact , I 'm disamored to this fish , because I sat it after that conversation , the fish knew of pollo .
The second fish is a story of love .
It 's a romantical story that the kind of story that I know the fish and the most of the fish .
I ate it for the first time in the south of the Spain .
A journalist of my journalist of this fish .
Prically , he had to meet us .
He came to the table to the table bright .
The chef had it too much .
Pratically , that twice as much as it was .
Incrediably , it was so delicious .
Who is able to make a fishing fish so good after you 've been there ?
I don 't know , but this guy .
Camian Miguel .
It 's actually called Miguel .
No , he didn 't have the fish , and it 's not a chef .
At least , not the sense that we mean .
It 's a biologist in Vet The Palma , which is a height of the Spaign corner of the Spaign of the Fuvir Westerday 's footh .
Fine to the 1980s , the lift to the ' 80s .
They had a bovine on what was essentially a paludose zone .
They had to make the land by building a series of canal untricate channels in the river .
Well , they can 't do it work to do the thing not from the economic view .
And , from an ecological view , it was a disaster .
He killed something like 90 percent of the birds and , considering the place , it 's a lot of birds .
So , in 1982 , a Spanish company with an environmental consciousness to bought the ground .
What do they do they do ?
They 're actually going to be the lower of the boundaries .
They actually invert the internit .
Instead of conscious water away from the ground .
They have all the channels .
They created a 27 mile fishes from 27 mile acres , anguille musters , anguille , and this process , Miguel and this process , Miguel , and this invertirate from the ecological destruction .
The farming is incredible .
I mean , you 've never seen something like this .
Loook at the horizon , which seems to be a million miles and everything that you see are the inhonests and this rich , dense land .
I 've been there a little Miguel .
It 's an incredible kind of three quarters Charwin and a quarter Crocodile Dune .
OK ? We were doing it in the middle of this lagon , and I was swallowed , I had the heavily , I had the skills and Miguel , calculus , he had his lesson of biology .
First , I think , a white rare .
And then it explains the mineral need of the fitoplancton , and you see a kind of raging of the Tanzania .
It turns out that Miguel has spent a lot of his career to the National Park Mikumi in Africa .
I asked him how he became a tale of fish .
He said , " Let me ? I don 't know anything fish .
I 'm an expert in relationship . "
And then you 're going to launch back to the rare on bird , alge and strange and wheels .
Don 't sentence , all this was very fascinating , which was really fascinating , which is , as a biotic community .
Yeah , it 's interesting , but I was in love with it .
And my head was continued to rethink of that delicious heavy fish that I had eat the previous night .
So , I said , " Miguel , what makes your fish so good ? "
He said the alge .
" I know , I know , the alge , the fitoplancton , yes , yes , it 's incredible .
But your fish , what do you eat ?
What 's your likely conversion rate ?
Well , he responds to me to how their own is a rich system so rich that the fish eat exactly what they missing in an self-ethic environment .
The biomass of plants , the oplancton , is the zooplancton , is all that feeding the fish .
And the system is so healthy that it completely .
There 's no eat me .
Have you ever heard of a lift that 's not giving you to eat the animals ?
More later , I was driving around the ground with Miguel , and I said , " In a place like this , it seems like this natural different from any farming that I 've ever seen , as you do measuring the successful ? "
In that precisely moment , it was like the record of an ordinary movie that changes the set .
We looked at the corner , and we see a scene between the incredible thousands and thousands of fenicotteres and thousands of fenyles and thousands of fenicopters .
" That 's success , he said . "
" Look at their pance , they 're rose .
They 're banking . "
Banchasing ? I was completely confuse .
And I said , " Miguel , but are not banking with your fish ? "
" Yeah , " he said , "
" Let 's go to 20 percent of the fish and the eggs for birds .
Last on last year , there were 600,000 birds more than 250 species .
It has become the biggest and one of the most important private health care for birds for the birds in all Europe . "
I said , " Miguel , but a population population of bird is not the last thing that you would like in a fish farm ? "
It 's your head , no .
He said , " We 're going to stand in an extensive way .
This is a network .
Fenicopters eat the leg .
The leambers eat the fitoplancton .
So , the more of the fenicotteres of the fenicotter is the system . "
OK , so we reassumption . We 're not going to be eating to eat his own animals and measured his success to the health of his predators .
A fishes of fish , but also a bird for bird .
Ah , by the way , those fenicotterers shouldn 't even be there .
They do the nest in a distant city , 150 miles where the nest conditions are better for building .
Every morning , they fly for 150 miles , and they get to the hold , and every night , you get 150 miles for the back .
They do it because they 're able to follow the white line of the A92 .
At the serious .
And I thought I was a kind of like the penguins , so I looked at Miguel .
And I said , " Miguel , they want to 150 miles up to it up for 150 miles of night to go back ? "
They do it for their little ? "
He looked at me as I had just quotney a song of Whitney Houston .
He said , " No , " No , they do it because food is better . "
I didn 't talk about the skin of my heavy fish that was delicious , and I usually don 't like the skin of the fish .
I don 't like abustoled , I don 't like it .
It 's the sounds like to aside .
It 's never nearly .
And yet , when I hired him in that south of the Spain didn 't know anything about the fish .
He had a sweet , and he was like to give a morsweet in the ocean .
And I said , this to Miguel , and he annued him .
He said , " The skin is like a spay .
It 's the last defense before anything to enters in the body of the fish .
It 's evolved to deal impurity . "
And then you add , " But our water doesn 't impurity . "
OK . A lift that doesn 't feed his fish .
A farming that measured the success of his predators .
And then I realize that when he says that the farmers don 't have impurity a lot of it because the water the water that fluds into that farms is from the river , which is a river that is a river that brings , and it 's all the things that the rivers tend to be writing chemicals .
And when it comes down the system and the water is more clean when it comes .
The system is so healthy , which can clear water water water .
So , not only a farming that it doesn 't feeding his animals not only a farming that measurements measurements in its predators , but a farming that is literally a clear , which is literally a purification of water , and not only for those fish , but also for you .
Because when the water comes out , it goes to the Atlantic .
It 's a drop in the ocean , I know , but I do the benefit , and so you should do it because this story of love as a romantic love as well as a romantic .
You could say that it 's a recipe for the future of good food is that you 're talking about fish that you 're talking about fish .
What we need now is a new radical conception of radical agriculture in which food is really a good one .
But for a lot of people , this is a little too radical .
We 're not reality , we 're passionate about food .
We are among .
We love the small farmers .
We love the little familiar farms .
We talk about the local food land .
Let 's look at biological .
And when you say that these are the things that will make sure will make the future of good food , someone somewhere stands up and says , " Hey , even you know , I like you know that they 're going to feed , but how do you think you can feed the world ?
How do you think we could feed the world ? "
Can I be synthy ?
It 's a question that I don 't like .
No , not because we 're doing it already more calories to be able to feed the world .
A billion people suffering the hunger today .
A billion , more than how many of us have ever been -- because of the enormous amount of defollow in the distribution , not for the complex amount of .
You see , I don 't like this question because he determined the logic of our food system in the last 50 years .
To you look at the pesticides to the monoculture , chemicals , chemicals to land , and all this time the agriculture has simply asked , " If we can feeding more people in the economic way , what is wrong with what we do ? "
This was the motivation .
It was the justify .
It was the plan of the business of American agriculture .
We should call it for what it is , an industry in liquidation an industrial that is fast herodying the ecological capital that makes the same kind of production possible .
This is not an industry , and it 's not agriculture .
Our lander today is not threatened forniture , but for the fresources in decreases , not for the last mechanical invention , but for fresh water , not for the fishes , but for fresh water , not for fresh water , but for forests , but for the forests and the rets , but for the fishes in the sea .
You want to feed the world ?
Let 's start asking us , how are we going to do it ?
Or better , how can we create the conditions that are feed to every local community to feed itself ?
To do that , we don 't look at the model of the future .
It 's an old and stick model .
It 's all about capital , chemistry and machines , and it never really produced anything good to eat .
Instead , we look at the ecological model .
It 's what it 's about two billion years of the work .
Let 's look at Miguel , at the farmers like Miguel to hands and farmers that are not just performed in itself in farms that they 're not just prodaily producers in exercise that they 're not just prodaily producers , rather than just intalone , but experts in relationships , because they are the ones that are the ones that are those are the ones that are also experts in the knowledge .
If I have to be synthy , they 're really better than I 've ever been .
You know , it 's good , because if that 's the future of good food , it 's going to be delicious .
Thank you .
I grew up with a ferre-based diet .
I had a schooly high school , an hour back and forth every day .
And I was always immersed in a book , a phantascience book , who was carrying my mind in other worlds , and satisfaced , in form narrative , that I had .
And that curious curiosity was also in the fact that every time I wasn 't in school , I was out in the boss , and frogs , frogs , frogs , snaked them to the microscope .
I was a real geek of science .
But it was always trying to understand the world , to understand the world , understanding the limitations of possible .
And my love for phantascience , actually seemed to respect the world around me , because what was going on , in the 1960s -- we were going to go to the moon , Jacques Cousteau , and Jacques Cousteau came into our jes with great documents that show us animals and places , and a wonderful world that we would not even have .
So , all it seemed to give my passion for phantoy .
And I was an artist .
I knew how to draw . I knew about it .
And because there were no video games , or this saturation of movie generated computers , nor all these images in the media landscape , I had to create these images in my head .
From children , when we read a book , we all had to take a book of the author , put something on the screen of our tests .
And so , my answer was to paint , drawing creatures , alien creatures , aliens , aliens , all this stuff .
The mathematics of mathematics was always drinking behind the book .
This is because creativity had to find a way away .
And it happened to be an interesting thing : the Jacques Cousteau programs were involved to the fact that there was a alien world right here .
I would not be going to go to a alien world on a spacecraft .
It was very unlikely .
But that was a world where I could go to really , right here on the earth , more rich and exotic and exootic what I would ever have imagining these books .
So , I decided that I would be going to become a 15 years old .
And the only problem I was living in a little Canada , to 600 miles from the ocean near .
But I didn 't leave me .
I looked at my father until he found an immersion school , New York City , New York , just spent the boundary where we lived .
And so I was able to take the certified in a full of the YMCA in the winter in Buffalo , New York .
And I wouldn 't see the ocean , the real ocean , for two years , until we 're going to go to California .
From the last 40 years , I spent about 3,000 hours , I spent about 3,000 hours , and 500 of these hands .
And I learned that the depth of the ocean , even the several oceans , which is surprising the ocean beyond our imagination .
The imagination of nature is without confined to our human imagination .
Again today , I 've got to see when I 'm immersions .
And my story of love with the ocean continues , the stronger than never been .
But when I picked up a career , I chose to do movie .
It seems to be the best way to concilize this smania to tell stories with smania to create images .
And , as a boy , I was constantly comics and so on .
So I was the only way to put together images and stories .
Everything came back .
And of course the stories that I chose to tell were stories of phantascience : " Termintator , " Aliens " and " The Abyss . "
And with " The Abyss , " I joined my love for depth and immersions to do a movie .
So , I flies the two steps .
From " The Abyss " came out something interesting that was solving a specific problem in that film , which is to create the kind of a liquid water creature .
And so he was born the first character to die , and animated animated to the computer that had ever seen in a movie .
And even though the movie has not done a lot of money , I would say that , despite was repaid , I was testimoned by this magic .
You know , it 's the law of Arthur Clarke , which every technology is inguible by the magic .
They were seeing something magic .
And this was very excited .
And I thought , " Fantastic , this is something that must be adopted in the movie art . "
So , with " Terminator 2 , " my next movie , I went a lot of beyond .
Lavoring with the Industrial Light and Magic , we created the liquid metal in that movie . The successful thing was going to work .
And it worked . And we 've done a magic created a magic .
And we got the same result with an audience .
But we 've got a little bit more with that movie .
So , I 'm doing a line between these two points of experience , I came to the conclusion that this would be a whole new world of creativity for the movie artists .
So , I 've put up a company with Stan Winston , my friend friend Stan Winston , which was the main truck , which was the main truck , and we called it Digital Domain .
And the principle of the society was to leave us to the past , the optical processes and so on , and so on , and then go directly to the digital production .
And so we 've done , and we gave a competitive advantage for a little bit .
But we 're back to half the ' 90s in the ' 90s of creatures and characters , which is what we had founded the society .
So , I wrote this textbook called " " Hatar " with the intending to the massive effectively , generated to computers , with human characters and emotional characters in computers , and all the main generated computers , and all of the main generated computers .
And the whole thing was remadied to the mitter .
The kids of society told me that we couldn 't do this for a little bit .
So , I took this and I made this this film of a big ship .
At the study , I throwing it as a " Romeo and Juliet on a ship . "
It would be a story of love , a passionate story , a passionate movie .
Seretly , what I wanted to do was immerged to see the relationship of " Titananic . "
That 's why I did that movie .
And it 's the truth . The study didn 't know it .
But I convinced them . I said , " We 're going to take it to the relationship .
We 're going to use it for the beginning of the movie .
It 's going to be very important . It 's going to be a great marketing . "
And I convinced them to finance a expedition .
It looks like a crazy . But this brings back to imagination that creates the reality .
Because we really created a reality and six months later , I found on a a submersible Russian submersible , in the North Atlantic of the North , looking at the true Titanic from a oblabs , not in the definition , but really for it .
I 've been sleep .
And it took a lot of preparation , we had to build the movie and lights and lights and a lot of other things .
But I 've been trained by those profound deep deep dive , it was like a space mission .
where it was highly technical , and they would required enormous planning .
You 're going to put you on this capsule , you go down to this darkly environment where there are no hopes to be saved , you can 't go back to yourself .
And I thought , " Fantastic . It 's like living in a phantoilet movie .
It 's really great . "
And so , I was deployed by the depths of the depth of the ocean .
Of course , the curiosity , scientific component .
It was all .
It was curiosity . It was imagination .
And it was an experience that Hollywood was not able to offer .
Of course , I could imagine a creature and create a visual effect . But I couldn 't imagine what I could see out of the oblay .
In our successful expeditions , I 've seen creatures with hydrothermal airs and , sometimes , things that I 'd never seen before , things that no one had seen before , which is actually not even described from science to time , and imagine .
So I was all taken from this , and I had to do more .
So I took a curious decision .
After the success of " Titanic , " I said , " OK , I 'm going to put my daily work of the Hollywood regist of Hollywood , and I do the explorer at a while . "
So , we started planning these expeditions .
We found us to go to Bismark and explore it with robotic vehicles .
We went back to Titananic .
We had little robots that we had a little robots that we had the fiber eight .
And the idea was to go to and do an survival , which had never been done .
Nobody had ever looked inside of the relationship . They didn 't have a mile to do it , so we created the technology to do it .
So here I am on the Titanic bridge , sitting in a submersible , looking at the asses that look like these , where I knew that they had to play the violinists .
And I 'm driving a little robotic vehicle through the ship of ship .
When I say that , I 'm driving it , but my mind is in the vehicle .
It seemed to be physically present in the Titanic relationship .
And it was the most surround of the most surreal surreal that I 've ever lived , because you know , before I was going to turn the corner , I knew what would be behind , before the lights of the vehicicle , because I had path the set for months to the movie .
And the set was based on a replication of the ship model of the ship .
So it was an absolutely extraordinary experience .
And it really made me realized that in the telepresence of the telepresence that you can take through these avators , the mind is injected in the vehicle , in this other form of existence .
It was very profound .
And it could be a little assembly of what could happen between a few decades when we 're going to start having the cyborg for the explorations or other motivates in the human future that I can imagine , from the advantasy .
So , we 've done these expeditions , and we really started to appreciate what there was under , as the open depth of the ocean where these animals had these animals .
In fact , they 're alien right here on the land .
They live in a chemosynthesis environment .
They don 't survive in a sunlight , how we do it .
So , you see animals that are close to 500 degree water running .
It looks like even impossible .
At the same time , I was really interested in space , again , one time , is the flu of the phantoy , as a girl .
And I finished in space environment , really involved with NASA , sitting into the NASA , sitting in the NASA , to plan missions , go to Russia , to go to Russia , to go to Russia , and all of these things , to fly to fly the international space station to the international space station with our telectional 3D .
It was fascinating .
But what I ended to do is to take the space scientists with us in the absis .
And then bring them down , because they could have access to -- that they could be access to these extreme environments , bring them down and allow them to get them up and allow them to see , take samples , to test tools and do it .
So , we were going to go through documentary , but we really did science , space science .
I had to closed the ring between being phand phantascience , to do those things really .
And you know , I learned a lot of learned .
I learned a lot of science . But I also learned a lot of the leadership .
Everybody thinks that a regist should be a leader , the chapter of the ship , or something like that .
I didn 't know about all the leadership before I did all those expeditions .
Because I had to say , " What am I 'm doing here ? "
Why am I doing it ? What do I get to ? "
You don 't have anything to do all these spectacles .
At the evil we 're going to pari . There 's no famous .
People think almost that I went to " Titanic " and " Hatar " and " Hatar " and " Hatar " and " Hatar " and "
I 've done all these movies , all these documentary documentary .
Nobody , no glory , no money . What am I doing ?
I 'm doing it for the task , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the biggest challenge that there is the biggest challenge that there , and for the strange of the discovery , when a little group of people form a team deployed .
Because we did everything with 10-12 people working together , working together for years .
Sometimes in the sea for 2-3 months of file .
And in the legacy , you realize that the important thing is the respect you have to , and that they have for you , when you finished a task that you can 't explain to any other .
When it comes back to the earth and explains , " We had to do this , and the optical fiber , and that , all of the technology , and that , all technology , and the spread , and the spread of performance when you 're working in the sea . It 's what maybe they only have to be the policempowering polices or the soldiers they have to something together and they 'll never explain that .
To create a bond , to create a legacy of respect .
When I came back to do my movie , which is " Hatar . " I tried to apply the same principle of leadership the same principle of leadership is to respect the team and changing their respect .
It 's really changed the dynamic .
And so here I 'm still in a little group , in territory inexplored to do " Havatar " to do " Havatar " with new technologies that didn 't exist .
Terribly exciting .
By businesses .
And we 've become a family , in four and a half years .
And it completely changed my way to do movie .
People have started saying that I took the organisms from the ocean and I put them on the planet .
For me , it was the essence of how to do business , which was changed .
What can we do that ?
What are the lessons we 've learned ?
I think that the first is curiosity .
It 's the most powerful thing that we have .
The imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality .
And the respect of the group is more important than all the world 's training .
To records , and they tell me , and they say , " Dams to do this . "
And I said , " Don 't limitations .
Other people are going to do it for you , not to do it , you don 't expect against you .
And you have risk . "
NASA always says this phrase : " The mistake is not contempt . "
But the mistakes must be an option in the art and exploration , because it 's how to do a hall .
And no important attemplated that was done without risk .
You have to be disposed to run these risks .
This is the thought I want to leave you , which is that in whatever you do , the mistakes is an option , but the fear no . Thank you .
If I wanted you to understand one big idea is that we consumption is that we consumed is bigger than the sum of his parts , and that instead of thinking about the too much information , I would think of how to use information to make new new relations so to emerge new trends , otherwise .
So here you see the types of organized mortality .
This instrument that I use is a little experiment .
It 's called Pivot , and Pivot , and I can choose to filtering one of death , say the accidents .
And then we see emergency new relationships .
The reason is that here in the central part of the people are more active .
We can do a step back and reorganize the data because of death , we see that circulatories and cancer are the major initiated disease , but not for everybody .
If we go on , and we 're going to say , 40 , we see that the accidents are the cause of death that more .
I 'm closer to , which is especially for men .
So you 've got to visualize information and data in these way is a little bit like swimming in a degree information ,
And if we can do that with a raw data because you don 't do that with the content ?
So , for example , we have the cover of every Sports Illustrated .
All of this . Everything in the network .
You can return into your rooms and try to get you .
You can look at a decade .
Or a specific year .
You can isolating a particular number .
For example , we take the athletes that appears in this number , their sports .
And I 'm a Lance Armstrong , so I 'm clicked up here and I see all the numbers in which LArmstrong .
Now , if I want to give you a look at all , you can think , " Why don 't I look at all the cycle ? "
I 'm a step back back , and I 'm the visual .
And now I see Greg Lemond Lemond .
You know that , you know , when you go between the information in this closer , or further away from going back and forth and it 's not just a research , it 's not just a browser .
But you do something slightly different .
It 's a half that we think it 's going to change how we can use information .
So , we 're going to take a little bit a crazy .
We took every single page of the Wikipedia page , and we reduced it up to a little synchosis that it 's a little synthy , and an icycle that is the thematical area .
I 'll just show you the first 500 of the most visited about Wikipedia .
Even in this limited skills , we can do a lot of it .
You understand what thematic areas are the most visited on Wikipedia .
At this point selections .
We see this option , we see that the Wikipedia of Wikipedia more often associated with this voice is the " Ely-Time Magazine .
This is significant because it makes emergency something that in Wikipedia .
And you see it just a step back to see the together .
If I take one of these reports , I can then zooming on the category " of the Magazine " of the Magazine .
and see them all .
And I see that most of the government comes from the world of government is a minore from the world of science . One minor the world of business .
Here 's my head .
One comes from music .
And , rather interesting , Bono also has won a TED prize .
So let 's go to see all the winners of the TED prize .
So , we 're really navigating in the network , as if it was a network , not by page , but at a superior .
I want to show you another thing that could surprise .
This is the site of the New York Times .
Pivot , this application -- we don 't call it browser , because it 's not a browser , but we need to see web pages -- we add this this technology for zoom in web , like this .
I can do a step back and right back to a specific section . This is important because I just see the Web pages , so it makes me see the web pages so .
I can zooming what I 've done in moments .
Here you see this state of the demo that I 've just presented .
I can see some other things that I 've seen in the day .
If I want to do a step back and see everything , I can do with my historical or the historical of my research .
And I was looking for newspaper , I was trying the Bing motor Bing , here for Live Labs Pivot .
And from here I can zooming on my Web pages and just reflect from here .
An metaphor , a lot of times , and in any case the result of the parts , of the data is the major of the kind of data .
So , in the world , the data are seen as a kind of males .
It 's talking about information sudden .
It 's talking about dry to annegate in data .
And if we put all all over if we put the Web above instead of going from one thing to the other one thing , would we get used to to go from a lot of other things , and then we can see those structures that otherwise .
And then instead of feeling us in the data , we could really extract information .
Instead of doing information , we can pull out of the knowledge .
And by the knowledge , maybe even to the wisdom .
And with this thank you .
So , these days , they all talk about happiness .
I asked to count the number of content books , the word " happiness " in the title and published in the last five years , they 're stopped to count for 40 , and there were more .
There 's a huge wave of interest in happiness , between researchers .
There 's a lot of coaching about happiness .
Everybody would want to make the happier people .
But despite all this flow of work , there are a series of " which are making a series of " which are making a kind of impossible to elaborate ideas about happiness .
My speech of today is going to be especially about this .
And it 's about the profan people who think about their happiness , and it 's about studying happiness , because we 're going to look at happiness , because we are confused as all the other people .
The first one of these traps is relaptancy to admit the complexity .
In fact , that the word happiness is no longer as useful as much as a word as it looks at too many fields .
And I think that you can restrict a particular meaning , but in massive line of massive , but we 're going to have to deal with this acception , and we have to have to adopt the most complicated vision of what the well-being .
The second training is confusion between experience and memory . It 's basically about to choose between being happy to be happy in life , and be happy to be happy to be in your life or happy about their own life .
And these are two extremely different concept , both part of the concept of happiness .
And the third one is the illusion of focused for which is the unfortunate that we can 't think of any circumstance that affect the importance of well-being without distoring the importance .
I mean , it 's a real cognitive truth .
and there 's no way to do the right thing .
I 'd like to start with a person who , after a session of questions and answers , after one of my lesson , told a story .
[ unclear ] -- he said , while he was listening to a symphony of music , right short magnification at the end of the record , and they heard it .
And then you add , in a very emotional way , which he found the entire experience .
But it was not true .
The one that was ruined was the remember of the experience .
He had the experience .
And he had heard for 20 minutes of the wonderful music .
but that doesn 't count for anything because he remained a certain remember ; he had a certain time ; the remember , and the remember was everything that they would remained .
What this episode tells us , at the bottom , is that we could think of ourselves and other people in terms of two sis .
There 's a sharing sharing experiences , which is living in the present and knows the present , and it 's able to revive the past , but that actually has the present .
It 's about " and it 's living experiences , and what the doctor is going to happen to -- you know when the doctor asks , " To you do it bad now , when you hurt here ? "
And then there 's the question that you remember , " it 's " it 's " and it reminds that you reminds the points , and it 's all about the history of our life , and is that it 's what the doctor is going to ask , " How are you heard in the last time ? "
or " How did you go to Albania ? " or something like that . "
Those are two entities , which is a different experience , and what if you remember , and to confused between the two is part of the confusion about the notion of happiness .
And it reminds , it 's a dotaster .
And this process starts with a fundamental response of our recurring .
We not only don 't tell stories only when we decide to tell them .
Our memory tells us stories , which is that we remain our experiences is a story .
Let me start with an example .
It 's an old study .
that brings the experiences of two patients during a painful processing .
I 'm not going to get into detail . It 's not even more painful a day of the day , but it was painful in the ' 90s .
And he asked the patients to report their pain every 60 seconds .
And here 's the results for two patients .
Those are their results .
If you ask , " Who is the two have suffered ? "
It 's a very simple question .
Clearly , the Patient B has suffered more than that .
its bonscopy longer , and for every minute of pain suffering from the patient . At the B has suffered at least as much A or more .
But now there 's another question : How many of these patients think they have suffered ?
And here 's the surprise : Oxxiety of A reminds of a remindity of the Patient B.
The stories of copies were different given that a particularly delicated part of the procedure is the way to -- no one of these stories is particularly positive -- but one of the two is particularly good -- but one of the two is particularly a different one of the two is particularly bad .
And the worst is that where the pain was maximum at the end .
It 's a negative story .
How do I know that ?
Because we asked these people after colonscopy , and even a distance of time , " How much negative experience , everything considered ? "
And we got a long worst for A to B , in the remember .
So , it 's a direct conflict between the evis that living experiences , and it reminds it .
From the point of view of the sis that it 's clear that it 's clear that you have more jobs .
So , what you could do for the patient A , and we 've done with clinical experiments , and it was really done , and it 's been done , and it works , you could extend the pippy of the Patient A to keep the tube without moving .
This will cause a little bit of pain in patient , but only a little bit , and much less than before .
And I do this for a couple of minutes , the evis that living the experience of the Patient At . It 's going to be worst , and that remember the experiences of the Patient A lot better time , because now Patient remember the experience of his experience .
How do you call a story ?
And this is true for stories that are from the recurring that the stories that we invent what we call a story , are the changing moments and final changes .
The final is very , very important and , in this case , the final has dominated .
So , the evis that living experiences live his life in a continues .
Does it have moments in which soon . And you know , what does that happen to these moments ?
And the answer is simple .
They 're losing to say that most of our life -- to say that most of our life -- to how I 've calculated the psychologist tells that it means that in a life , we have about 600 million . In a month of a month if we 're not left .
Most of them are completely ignored by the sis that recurrent .
And yet , in some way you have the feeling that should be happy , that what happens in these moments of experience is our life .
It 's the limited resources that we 're spending while we are in this world .
And how to spend it , it would seem relevant , but it 's not the story that it reminds for us .
So we have a sharp shares , and a shares , and a sharing experiences that are quite different experiences .
The bigger difference between the two is how to treat time .
From the point of view of the sis that lives , if you go in vacity , and the second week is fun as much as the first , then the vacation of two weeks is two times better than the vacation of a week .
But this is not absolutely the way that sis that reminds remind .
For the sis that remember , a vacity of two weeks is very much better than one of vacity , because there are no new reminds in addition .
You haven 't changed the story .
And in this way , time is the critical variable that distinguishes the evis that it reminds of the sis that lived in experiences .
The time has a limited impact on this story .
Well , the shares , that remember experiences experiences more than to remember and telling stories .
It 's actually what it 's going to be decisions because , if we look at a patient who 's had , for instance , two copies with two different medings , and it 's deciding what the two chooses , what you 're going to choose .
The shares lives in these choices .
In fact , we don 't choose in experiences , but between the reminds of those experiences .
And even when we think about our future , we don 't think about our future as experiences .
We think of our future as a memories as you know .
So you 're basically looking at this situation , as a tyrannia of sis that reminds , and you can think of the sis that reminds of the experience of which , the experiences experience , which is living experiences , it doesn 't need .
I feeling that when we go in vacity , it 's often the case , you go to vacance the service of our own seems that remember .
And this is a little hard to justify .
It 's , how do we use our memories ?
This is one of the explanations that comes to the predomination of sis that remember .
When I think about that , I 'm in a vacity in the Antarctica of a few years ago , which is one of the best vacity of my life , and I think relatively , respect the other vacation .
And I probably spent to think of that journey of three weeks , to say , 25 minutes in the last four years .
If I had ever opened the sign with the 600 photographs of the journey , I would spent another time . It 's about three weeks of journey that is going to translate an an hour and a half an hour . It seems to be a disreplie .
Well , I could be a little extreme , in my showing appeted for the remind consumption , but even if you do more than this , a genuine question .
Why do we take a weight to the weight that we go in experiences ?
I want you to think about an experiment with thinking .
Imagine that during the next vacation , and you know , at the end of the vacity of the vacity of all the photographs will be destroyed , and you take a medicine medicine for amnesia , so you don 't remember anything .
Are you going to choose the same vacity ? And if you could choose a different vacity , you create a conflict between two sis and you have to think of how it 's solve , and you 've got to think of how long time you have an answer .
And if you think in terms of recurrent , you could get another answer .
The because we choose the vacces that we do , is a problem that we 're going to put in front of the two sis .
The two smooth notions of happy .
There are actually two happy concepts of happiness that we can use , one for each sis .
So you can ask , how happy is that it makes the experience ?
And then you can ask , how happy are the moments in sis that lives ?
And it 's about -- happiness for moments , it 's a complicated process .
What are the emotions that we can measure ?
And anyway , now , we 're able to make a good idea of the happiness of sis that living experiences in time .
If you tomorrow happiness , it 's a completely different thing .
It 's not how happy a person alive .
It 's about how sophister , or you know , it 's the person when you think about his life .
It 's a very different idea .
Anybody is not able to distinguish these two notions , it 's not going to be able to create confusion in happiness , and I look at a bunch of students of well-being , and I 'm going to look at a long time .
The difference between the happiness of sis that lived experiences and satisfaction that has been recognized in the last few years , and there are now some of the efforts to measureing two separately , the Gallup institute where more than half a million people have been substantial depes on what they think of their life and their experiences .
And there were other studies in this direction .
So in the last few years , we started to learn about happiness .
And the biggest lesson that we 've learned , is that they 're very different .
You might know how much a person is satic with your life , and yet this doesn 't tell you a lot about how happy they 're living your own life and neversa .
To give you an idea of correlation , the correlation is about 0.5 .
which means that if you meet somebody , and they told you , " Oh , her father is 1,80 m " how would you know about its height ?
Well , you would know something about its height , but with a lot of uncertainty .
You would always have a bit of uncertainty .
If I tell you that somebody thinks his life is at eight in a scale from one to 10 , you 'll be very uncertain about how happy they are with their own lived with their sis that lives .
So the correlation is is low .
We have a certain knowledge of the satisfaction of sis happy .
We know that money is very important , the goals are very important .
We know that being happy means to be happy to be done with the people who love us , to spend of time with people who love us .
And there are other pleasure , but these are the major .
So if you want to massive happiness of the two sis , you 're going to end a lot of different things .
The conclusion of what I said is we should not think about happiness as a substitute of well-being .
It 's about two completely different ideas .
At more , very quickly , another reason that we can 't think in linear to happiness is that we don 't care about the same things when we think about life , and when we think about life .
So , if you do the simple question of how happy it is to California , you can 't get the right response .
When you ask this question , you think you should be more happy in California , which is in Ohio .
What happens is that when you think about the California , you 're thinking about the contrast between California and other places , and for that compared to the climate .
Well , the climate is not that climate is not as important for shares , and it 's not really important for the sis that that reflects is that reflects that reflects is that it 's what you decide how happy are the people .
But because it turns out it 's in charges , you could end , you could end , some people , at the end , you 'll transfer to California .
And it 's interesting to verifying what 's going to happen to the people that are transfer to California to be more happy .
Well , the sis that living experiences will not become happier .
We know it .
But what 's going to happen . They think they 're more happy , because when they think they 're thinking about , they will remember how terrible it was the time in Ohio .
And they 're going to think that the right decision .
It 's very difficult to think of well-being , and I think I 've given you the idea of how hard it is .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I have a question for you .
Thank you very much .
When we were at the telephone a couple of weeks ago , he mentioned me that an interesting result of the Gallup .
Is it something that you think we 're going to share that we still have some minute ?
Daniel Kahneman : Yeah .
I think the most interesting results that we 've found in the Gallup is a number , which we didn 't expect to find .
We found that , with reference to the happy sis that lives experiences .
When we looked at how the feelings variassume with income , we 've discovered that , at the underneath of a 60,000 dollars a year , for Americans , on one a very vast sampion on a very vast samples of about 600,000 Americans , it 's a very vast spile , at the underneath of a 6000,000 dollars a year --
CA : 600,000 DK : 60,000 dollars a year , people are infelic , and they become progressively more infelic , and become progressively more unhappy as they become a poor , at the top line .
I mean , I 've seen this rarely , I 've seen .
Clearly , what happens is that money doesn 't understand the happiness of experience , but the lack of money , and it 's certainly misery , and we can measure that sery , and we can measure that seriously .
In terms of the other sis , reminds that it 's all the different story .
The more content six .
This is not giving an emotions .
CA : But Danny , all the effort of Americans are looking for life , liberty , the research of happiness .
If you take people seriously this discovery , basically , it turns out everything we 've found , for example , the politics on the taxes and so on the bottom and so on .
Is that politicians , and the nation in general , can we take a discovery as that is seriously and bring a public politician based on it ?
DK : You know I think I recognize the role of happiness in public politics .
The pressure of consideration will be slow in the United States , there is no doubt , but in the U.K. , is becoming reality , and in other states .
People are starting to recognize that they should think about happiness when they think about public politics .
You 're going to put a little bit and people start to talk about if they want to study the experience of happiness , or if they want to study the valuutation of life that we need to begin this debate to the most soon .
Like , as a happy happy direction , takes different directions to how you think , and depending on how you think , and then you think about the evening of the evening , or your experiences .
This is going to influence the politics , I think , in the years that will be .
In the United States , you 're doing the effort to measure the experience of the population .
And that , I think , it 's going to be part of the next decade , maybe two , of the national statistics .
CA : Well , it seems to me that this is going to be , or to less it should be , the discussion of the most interesting politics to follow in the next years .
Thank you very much for invented behavioral economy .
Thank you Danny Kahneman .
I 'm going to talk about energy and climate .
It may seem strange , because in my work at the foundation , I 'm not going to be very much more than poor people to live lives .
But climate and energy , in fact , they 're extremely important for these people , in fact , they are more important for everyone in the world .
A worst climate means , for many years , loss of crops .
It 's going to have any rain , or too few rain .
The things will change in ways that their fragile environmentally can not support .
which brings to hunger . It 's uncertainty .
So , climate campes , therefore , it will be for them .
Even the cost of energy is , for them , important .
In fact , if you could ablow the price of one thing , to reduce poverty , you would choose the energy , you would choose the energy .
The price of energy is down in time .
And a progret civilization of progress in energy .
The coal revolution has powered that industrial .
And even in the 20th century , we 've been seeing a rapidly decline in the electricity , that explains why we have the refrigerm , conditioners , we can create modern materials and do so many things .
So , in the rich world , we 're as as much as the electricity in a excellent situation .
But while the price goes down , for example of the half , we 've got to respect a new vincular , the vincular of CO2 emissions .
The CO2 is climbing the planet , and his equation is very simple .
CO2 emitted to be a temperature , which is very negative effects .
So , at the climate and , maybe even worse , indirect effectively , in the sense that the natural ecosystems can 't get these rapid changes , and so they collapse .
It 's valuable how much temperature because of a increase of CO2 , and like one of the two worst things the other , and it 's uncertain , but not very much .
And there 's certainly uncertainty about how negative effect , but they 're going to be extremely negatives .
At that , I often asked the best scientists . We have to really reduce emissions almost zero ?
Don 't we only can we reduce or half a quarter ?
And the answer is that , as long as we 're not going to go to zero , the temperature will continue to wait up .
So it 's a great challenge , so .
It 's not how to say , " We 're going to go to a 3.5 points under a bridge . "
It 's not a little bit about "
It 's about to get to zero .
Now , we made a lot of CO2 every year , over 26 billion tons of tons .
About 20 tons for every Americans .
For the poor countries of the poor countries , it 's less than one tons .
The world 's average is about five tons of the worldwide .
And somehow , we have to make progress that we have to bring that amount of zero .
The emissions are constantly increased .
Just some economic changes have changed this tendency , so we have to go from increasing to the decreases to zero .
This equation has four factors .
It 's a series of multipplications .
We have the amount to the left , the CO2 , which has to be blue , and the farmers on the right is the population , the services in average person uses , the average energy request by a service and CO2 emit for uniquely and CO2 emitted for energy .
Let 's go to each factor , and we see how we can use it .
Probably , one of these numbers must lower fin almost zero .
It 's algebra .
We see a little bit .
The first factor is population .
The world has 6.8 billion people today .
We 're going to go to nine billion .
If we do a good job with the new vaccines , health reproductive health , we can decrease , we can decrease from the 10 , 15 percent , but here we 're going to use a 30 percent increase .
The second factor is the services that we use .
which makes everything , the food that we eat , the vestiary , TV , the warming .
They 're awful things , and freeze poverty means to provide these services for almost all the world .
And this is a good thing that this number .
In the rich world , in the richer world , we probably could save and use less , but in average , every year , this number is going to go .
And so , complex , the amount of services for herogen to be able to be more than double .
This is a very simple example of service .
You 've got the illumination in your house , to do their homework , but these guys not , so they go and read their homework below the lamples .
The efficiency efficiency -- and , the energy for units of service -- there are good news .
And this factor is not increasing .
Thank you very much of the inventions , new ways of illuminating , we 've done differently , constructed by a lot of the service can decrease , for a lot of services , you can decrease the consumed energy .
In some services you can reduce 90 percent .
There are other services , like fertilizers , or the transport airplane , where the plane margins are very , very , very intimers .
So , complex , consumption , the energy consumed , the energy consumed will be three to maybe six times .
But these early three factors reduce emissions from 26 to the best cases , maybe 13 billion tons .
It 's not enough .
Let 's look at the fourth factor , the key factor , the amount of CO2 emitted to units of energy .
The question is , can we reduce it to zero ?
If you burn carbon burn , no .
If you burn natural gas , no .
Almost all of the ways to produce the electricity , part of the renewable and nuclear , including CO2 .
So , what we 're going to do to global scale , and so , it 's to create a new system .
And we need to miracles .
And I think of miracle , I don 't mean something impossible .
The microprocessor is a miracle . The computer is a miracle .
The Internet , and its services are a miracle .
People here are participated to creation of many miracles .
We usually don 't have a scady , a given enter whose miracle .
It 's usually , you 're going to the window and something else is not .
In this case , we have to drive at all speed , and to make a miracle in the very restretch .
I asked , how to illustrate this concept ?
Is there any natural example , a few demonstration that capture the imagination of people ?
I thought about a year ago , when I took mosquitoes , and people found it fun .
And I made them particians that , in the world , there are people who live with mosquitoes .
This is my idea for energy .
I decided that to fly baby would be the year my contribute to the environment .
Here 's the labs .
They tell me that they 're not going to get out of the boats .
now , we can invent tricks like this , but they 're not going to be help .
We need a lot of solutions , or so many of them are , which work on big scale and very reliable , and although you 're exploring in many directions , I think that only five could be a very important effect .
I 've been the marches , the nuclear geothermal fusion , nuclear fusion , nuclear fuels .
They can also give some contribute , and if they can do more than I expect , but here I 'm interested in here , but here I 'm interested in that we 're going to work on each one , and not to give up one , and not to give up one , and because all brillies them .
Let 's go to the first fossil fuel combustion , carbon or natural gas , that 's carbon or natural gas .
Here 's our task seems , but it 's not , and it 's caught CO2 , after combustion , at the combustion , pressuit , put it up , put it out somewhere , and hoping that we 're going to allow us .
There are experimental technologies that capture 60 -- 80 percent CO2 , but reaching 100 percent of CO2 , but reaching 100 percent is going to be very difficult , and it 's going to be difficult and it 's going to be very hard to even put it up to where we have all this CO2 .
The most spectacular issue is still the longer term .
Who 's going to flow ?
Who will you have something that is literally billions of times more voluminous than any kind of imaginable to the nuclear or something ?
It 's a huge volume .
So it 's a hard problem .
Another function would be nuclear .
But the nuclear presents three big problems .
The cost , especially in nations , it 's high-regulated countries .
The issues of security , the feeling that nothing can go wrong , despite the sketch is handled by human operating , and that combustible is not used to be used for human workers .
And how do you run the screaming ?
More the amount of reducation , the concerns are so many .
People need to be insurance .
So , you know , so , you could solve , and that you could solve , and what you should work .
The last three of five sources , I sell groups .
They 're the ones that often defines " renewables . "
And to say the real , despite the great advantage of not require a combustible , they present some of the disadvantages .
The first is that the density of energy produced with these technologies is really inferior to that of an electric central .
It 's about " harvesting " , " and so many square miles of areas of a normal electronic central power .
Also , these sources are intermitter .
The sun doesn 't splenses all day , and it 's not all the victims .
So if you depends on these sources , you have to find a way of herogether , even when the source doesn 't make it .
It was challenges us on the costs of the cost .
And the distribution .
For example , let 's say that this energy source is in the summer .
So , not only you need technology , but you 've also got to do the rest with the rest of the summer .
And finally , the problem of accumulate .
To stimate the size of the problem , I looked at all kinds of bacteria today , for cars , computers , telephones , all the kind of thing , I took them with the amount of electric energy , in the world , and I 've discovered that all the bacteria now in the world and discovered that all the bacterial energy .
So we really need a big step forward , a improvement of 100 times respect to the approaches now in use .
which is not impossible , but it 's not very simple .
This problem is manifest when you intermittents , you know , 20 or 30 percent of the consumed energy , say , 20 or 30 percent of the consumed energy .
And if you take those sources for 100 percent , you need a miracy .
What 's the right approach ? What 's the right approach ?
Is it a Manhattan Project ? What could we solve the problem ?
A lot of companies , to hundreds , have to put it in work .
We need at least hundred people in each one of these five sectors .
Many of them , you look at them , you would call them . It 's a good thing .
And I think here , in the TED group , many people are already working on these camps .
Bill Gross has different companies , including a great companies that are great technologies to solar term .
Vinod Khosla is is investing in dozens of companies that are doing big things , and they have interesting potential things , and they have interesting potentially , and I 'm dying my support to that .
Nathan Myhrvold and I 're financing a company that , will surprise you , follow the nuclear road .
There are a few innovations in the ran , nuclear modulate , nuclear power nuclear .
But from a long time , the sector is that there are some good ideas around , that there are some good ideas around , it 's not really surprising .
The idea of Terrapower is , instead of bringing only part of the uranium , the U235 , one percent of the uranium uranium , one percent of the uranium , we decided to burn the U238 , the 99 percent is a crazy idea , in a certain sense .
For the truth to talk about it for a long time , but it 's never been going to try to if it would work or not , so thank you very much of the supercomputer modern supercomputers today can do a simulation and see yes , with the right materials seem to work .
And because it burns 99 percent of the uranium , the structure of the size of drastically .
They burned the screpair , and they use as a combustible even the earlier of today , that they become , from the problem that they were , a resource to exploit .
It 's consume remarkable . It 's kind of a candle . It 's kind of a candle .
It 's kind of like a little wood that argue . Space is called reactor reactor reactor .
From the point of the combustible the problem is solved .
Here 's a picture of a place in Kentucky .
And this is the 99 percent of the uranium , which is the most of the uranium , which was used as a combustible , and so it 's called uranium .
These downs would be the United States for centuries .
And filing the sea water , with a cheap process , there would be enough to the rest of this planet .
So , a lot of challenges attended us , but this is one example of the hundreds of hundreds of ideas of hundreds of ideas that we need to do it .
How should we measure our progress ?
What would they have to content the pages ?
And we 're going to try the goal , and then we use the intermedium .
You 've heard a lot of people talking about an 80 percent reduction for the 2050 , it 's really important to do that .
20 percent will be produced by the poor countries , and from a little bit of agriculture .
At that point , hopefully , we 'll have deforestation and production of the cement .
So to get to 80 percent , so , the countries developed countries , including nations like China , will have to replace completely their electric production .
The other question is , are we doing this technology to zero emissions ?
Are we doing this in practice in countries ,
Are we going to spread the allows ?
It 's a very important aspect .
It 's a key element of the page .
To you go back , what should we have the page of 2020 ?
The one should have the same two aspects .
We should be able to implementing measurements to begin to get the reductions .
We 're going to be the minor amount of CO2 , and so temperature .
But the vote in this matter , to do things that they don 't beat great reductions , has a weight only , or even the other , which is the speed of the innovation of new inventions .
We have to push these progress , and we can measure the speed , and we can measure the speed from the number of companies ,
Many good books have been written about it .
The Al Gore 's book , " The Gore 's choice , " and that of David McKay , " Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air . "
These books approach the problem , and they create a context in which they do the debate because these things need to be a spread .
Many things have to come up with contemporary .
So I 've got a wish ,
A very concrete wish that we 're going to invent technology .
If I had to choose one wish for the next 50 years , you can choose the president of the country , the realization of a vaccine , which I 'm going to take a vaccine , which is going to be able to do this thing that it costs half and it doesn 't CO2 , choose this last .
It would be with the biggest impact .
If this wish is not going to do , the fractance between the United States and the long term , between the United States and China , between the United States and China , between rich countries and rich , and especially , life of those two billion people will be long worst .
So , what do we have to do ?
What am I going to you to take the initiative and processing ?
It 's necessary to be a bigger to research .
When the countries came together as Copenhagen , they shouldn 't just talk about CO2 .
They have to discuss the innovation program , and you would stupieces of how much they 're going to investing in these innovative processes .
We need incentives , taxes on CO2 , the " cap and trade , instruments that you 're going to take the cost of the pollution .
We have to spread the message .
We have to make this more rational dialogue dialogue , and it has to include the government choices to include the government choices .
It 's a busy wish , but I believe it .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
Thank you . Just to know more about Terrapower , this is --
first of all , you can you give us a idea of the investment dimension ?
Bill Gates : Realize the software , to buying the supercomputer , assume all of the great scientists , what we 've done , requires only tens of millions , and even when we 're going to have tested materials in a reactor , to be sure that it 's going to be , we just talk about hundreds of millions .
The difficult thing is to build the pilot , to find varied billion-variated authorities , the place that will be built the first examples .
Once the first one , if it works as an announced , it 's going to be Cologist , because the costs , the density of energy , are completely different from nuclear that we know today .
CA : So , if I understand , this implies the construction , well-underground , of a vertical serbatoy full of nuclear combustible , of this kind of wildlife .
And then the process starts from the top and procreating the bottom ?
BG : Right , right . The reactors , are refornites continually , a lot of people , many control that can 't work , open continue , things that come in and out --
It 's not good !
If the combustible is very economic and you can do that for 60 years , put it in and forgotten and forgotten all of the complexity .
Keep there , burn for a sex-year-old , and then finished .
CA : A nuclear implant that makes a discussion .
BG : Yes . Well , you can leave them , then you can leave them , put them on another reactor and burn them .
And we 're going to start with the rejournals , now conserved in vases of cooling or to content .
They 're going to be our first combustible .
So what was a problem of conventional reactors will be the fuel , and the volume of the refuel is going to be a impressive way , just this process is going to be .
CA : But when you talk around the world of the potential of this technology , where most interest in this technology , where you 've been doing ?
BG : Well , there 's no place in particular , and there are all these interesting rules of transparency about everything that is defined nuclear , so we 're going to be very interest .
Our staff was in Russia , India , China .
I just met the Seretary for the Energy .
We 've talked about how this idea is trained to the current .
I 'm optimistic . French and Japanese have done in this field .
It 's a variation about something that 's already been done .
This is a substantial improvement , but it 's a quick reactor , which many countries have already built , so everybody has built , so everybody has built a fast reactor 's a good candidate to actor your own .
CA : What are the time and the probability that one of the time and the probability that one of the kind of thing .
BG : Well , for one of these projects , which produces energy , which produces energy , which is not really , we talk about 20 years to design it and 20 to build it .
This is the scady that the environmental models demonstrate .
So , you know , you know , it 's not very little bit , it could easily satisfied this goal .
And now there are , lucky , luckily , dozens of companies in the field , which analogly , if their research works , if their financially , they will compete .
And it 's better if a lot of solutions will be successful , because at that point you can remember a set of solutions .
It needs that at least has a success .
CA : To you talk about important , revolutionaries , this is the biggest that you know ?
BG : A energy revolution is the most important thing .
It would be even been without the environmental vincles , but the environmental vincles make it much more important .
In the rate of nuclear , there are other innovators .
We don 't know their work as well as this , but one is the nuclear " modulate " , " a different approach . "
There 's a liquid reactor . It seems hard to do , but maybe they say the same thing of us .
So , there are different , therefore , but the beauty is that a sprigion a million times more energy than a molecule , say , carbon molecule , say , carbon , you know , carbon terms of the negatives , potential in terms of effectively , in terms of effectively , in terms of effect on the environment and other way .
CA : And if it doesn 't work , what do we do ?
Wouldn 't we be able to start adopting measured to try to keep the terrestrial temperature ?
BG : If you 're in that situation , it 's a little bit like when you eat too , and you 're going to have a cardiac attack .
Where go to that point ? Could you need a surgeon or something like that .
There 's a whole line of research on the so-called geo-engineering , which is various technical techniques , which slow down the warming heat , which is slowing down to the action .
It 's as an insurance a policy .
You 're not going to have it .
Some people say that you should not even work at the policy because you might take you , make you keep eat because so much the surgeon is going to keep eating for you .
I don 't think it 's a wise choice , you know , the importance of the problem , but now in the geo-engineering ass , if you 're going to keep in case that the events where the events events , or innovations to come later , or innovations coming to predict .
CA : Clima-skeptics : if I had a phrase or two from them , how would you persuade them ?
BG : Well , unfortunately , there are different kinds of skeptics , and those who are advvancy .
Some people say that there is a negative feedback to the clouds that are dealing the warming effects of the warming effects .
They 're very , very few things that you can only tell you that there is a chance of a million that you have a chance in the main issues .
You can put a mistake up and the consequences just a lot of later .
And so , when you 're pressed by a thousand emergency , the idea of making sacrifice that you see the results only after --
sacrifice for you not as nots .
In fact , the IPPPPPPPPPPPPPPC , and it 's not necessarily the worst case ; there 's people in the rich that you look at IPPC and says , right , it 's not bad .
The fact is that incertainty should push us to action .
But my dream is that , if we can do it cheap , and to respect the vincles on CO2 , then they 're going to say , OK , I don 't care about if you don 't emits CO2 , almost prefer I would say that it because it 's cheap the technologies .
CA : Would you have this response to Bjorn Lomborg 's reasoning , that if you invest all your own energy to look at the CO2 , your goals will be sacrified . And that 's going to be sacrified ?
BG : Well , the spending spending in research and development --
we say that the U.S.A should spend 10 billion more than they do now , it 's not so ingent .
It shouldn 't be able to distract resources to others .
The things that are going to do a lot of money , and there are some reasonable of people , are the financial solutions .
So , for me , it 's especially .
Unless you 're not finding the curve of learning curve , as close to the point where it 's going to be very cheap , I think that the vading efforts are focused in technologies that have the potential of the baby .
If you had the alternative , we make the constantly energy , in a way that only the rich can afford to be able to afford , all of the presents can afford to pay the energy five times as much without changing life .
The disaster would be for those two billion .
And also Lomborg has reviewed his positions .
Her argument is , " Why don 't you 're not going to talk more than the Ricerca and Swuit ? "
So , for his past him again , you know , it 's a bunch of skeptical , but he understood that it 's a tremendous group , and so it 's lifetime .
And it 's a question that I think is appropriate .
It 's unbelievable how little we 're going to investing and development .
CA : Well , I think I 'm going to talk to the name of the audience , saying that I hope to see your wish . Thank you .
BG : Thank you .
I want to share with you a discover that I 've done a few months ago , I was writing an article for the Wired Mitalian .
I 've always been my dictionary of the synthy , as I write something , but I had already finished to correct the article and I realized that I never in my life trying to see what I would find out .
Let me read you the result .
" Seney , " aggecent : damed , indefeso , unuseful , unuseful , damed , stopped , layed , stopped , multiple , diamoned , consumed , impotent , impowerful , no impotent , Seney , decreployed , Seney , decreployed , stopping out of cut , cut off , swebed , swebed ,
Contrary : In form , strongly .
I was reading this list high list to a friend , and at the beginning , it was so ridiculed , but , I just read my voice , and I had to stop my voice , and I had to stop and take me to shock on the shock of these words have left me .
You know , we 're talking about my old dictionary dictionary ,
I 'm thinking , it 's going to be an old buildings , right .
But , in fact , the date of buildings was in the early 80s .
when I was starting the elementary schools , and I was forming what I was out of my family and on things that was out of my family and things around me .
and , unuseful to tell it , thank God I was not using the dictionary to that time .
I mean , from this explanation seems like I was born in a world that see someone like me as a one that has nothing good for them in any way for them , when I did today , I 'm celebrated for opportunity and adventure that my life processed .
So , I 'm immediately immediately went to see the 2009 , waiting me to find a without value .
This is the version of the description .
Unfortunately , it 's not much better .
I find the last two words undernear " particularly contrary " particularly discomode , " and " healthy " . " So , it 's not just looking at the words .
that 's what we believe people when we noticed them with these words .
It 's about the values behind these words , and how we build these values .
Our language , our thinking of our thinking about the world , and how we see other people .
In fact , many antic civilization , including that Greek and that Romana , believed that it was more powerful , because they would say the things to higher .
So , what do we want to bring a person who is limited , or a person that 's limited , or one person with greater force ?
So , you know , by doing something simple as a person , a child , we could put them on the taps and throw shadows on their strength .
Don 't we want to open for them ?
A person so , who opened me the door , it was the doctor of what I was girl . Alla the Dupont in Wilt , Dupont in Wilt , Dupont .
His name is Dr. Pizzuseful .
Italoked , which name appears , it was too hard to take for most Americans , so it was becoming to doctor for most Americans , so it became doctors .
And the Dr. P was wearly papillon , and it had a perfect inclination to work with children .
I was basically anything in the hospital that I spent in the hospital , with the exception of the sessions of fisiotherapy .
I had to do what seemed to do what seemed to exercise with these big fases , in different colors , you know , to help me build a legs .
And I hated these elastics more than anything .
And I hated them , really hated them , really hated them .
And , you know , I had already treatment , like one of five years , with Droctor to try to exercise from these exercise , Inutilly , clear .
And one day , he came to one of my seats and inexorables , these seats .
And he said , " wow , wow , Aimee , you 're a strong girl , I think that you 're going to break up one of those baby .
" When you break it , I 'll give you 100 dollars . "
Now , of course , it was just a little handle of the Dr. Os to do the exercise that I didn 't want to do the perspective to be the richer than the second plan , but , what he did , it was to make an alien shape a different kind of an aliera that we had a different kind of a journaliera .
and turn it into an interesting experience for me .
And with me today , the entity of his vision , and his dechiaring about me as a strong my view of this as a strong , he redefined my vision of myself in a strong , podery and athletic person to the future .
This is an example of how adults with positions of power can inflamp the force of a child .
But , in the example of the vocabulous definitions of the syntholic definitions , our language is not a chance to evolve to the reality that we all want , the possibility of an individual to see himself as absolutely , the possibility of an individual seeing itself as a chance .
Our languages , it 's not the step to the changes of our society , many of which have been created by technology .
certainly , a medical point of view , my legs , my legs , the operations of the laser for the view , ginches of titanium and even rambable bodies that are helping people to cooperate with their skills , and move beyond skills that are helping to identify their skills of social network , allow the people to identify their their own .
So , perhaps technology is going to be revealing us is a truth , which is always always been a truth , that each has something rare and going to give us to our society , and the human skills to adapt is our greatest quality .
The human skills of adapt , is something interesting , because people have always wanted to talk to me about difficulty insornmontability , and I have to tell you that .
This phrase , I 've never gone well , and I 've always heard in disconstructed to respond to people with this , and I think I 'm starting to understand why .
It 's subject in this phrase , unsormontable avversity , is the idea that success , or happiness , is reemergency from the other side of a challenge without damage or sign of this experience , if my success in life is to slavery is to slaving or the pressure of a life with protthetic , or what people perceived as my disability .
But in fact , we 've changed , we 've changed , logically , a challenge , or mentally both .
And I would suggest that it 's a good thing .
The avigation is not an obstacle that we have to travel in a way that we 're going to start our life .
It 's part of our life .
And I tend to think that 's like my shadow .
So , sometimes you noticed that , and sometimes almost nothing , but it 's always with me .
And , of course , he wasn 't trying to decrease the impact , the weight of a person .
There are deployed and the challenges in life , and it 's all true and relative to every single person , but the question is not if you have available , but as you 're going to go through .
So , our responsibility is not simply to protect the people to us from the avversity , but to make them in the right way .
And we do a damage to our children when we do them feel that they 're not ready to adapt .
There 's a important difference and distinction between the medical fact of being an objective person , and the subjective opinion society that I see me or not .
And , in truth , the only disability I had to deal with is if the world has ever thought that I could be described by those words .
In our desire to protect those that we love to protect those that we love from their medical life , or medings , or , really , really , the pronose of their life expectancy , we have to be sure that we don 't put the first morning in a wall that you 're going to be probably not to put the first morning .
Maybe you can just look at what 's rotated in you and how to put it , it can indebulate more the subject than the subject that disease itself .
In not to deal with one person in the birthday , not to understand his potential , we 're creating another disease to add to the natural suffering that they already have .
We 're actually giving a vote to the value of a person in our community .
So we 've got to see through the disease and the elenhance .
and more important , there 's a lot more important , there 's a relationship between suffering and our great creativity .
So , it 's not about use , or negare , or neging , these numerous research as something that we want to avoid or discovering the opportunity to avoidance , but rather to find those opportunity account with an accident .
So , perhaps the idea that I want to explain is that there 's not what as to overcome an avigation , how to be able to do it , to use a fight us , to use a fight us , to use a fight , maybe even dancing us together .
And , maybe , if we look at a crash as a natural thing and useful , we 're less overoverwhelmed by his presence .
This year , we 'll be a birthday of Charles Darwin , and it was 150 years ago , when you writing the evolution , which Darwin has illustrated , I think , the truth to the human character .
To tell you in another way , it 's not the stronger of the mirroes that survive , and it 's not even the smart that most smart , is the most smart of the changes .
The conflict is the genesis of cration .
From Darwin 's work , between other things , we can recognize that the human ability to survive and development is driven by the suffering of human spirit through conflict into transformation .
So , again , transformation , adaptation , is our bigger quality .
And perhaps , until we 're going to prove , we don 't know what we are made .
Maybe that 's what gives us the avversity , a sense of its force , a sense of its force .
So , we can do a gift .
we can imagine , re-imagining avigation as something more difficult period .
Maybe we can see it as a change .
We 've got a change to which we 're not adapted to .
I think the biggest adversity that we 've created is this idea of normality . Now , who is normal ?
There 's no normal there . There 's no normal . There 's no typical .
And would you want to meet those poor people if they exist ?
I mean , I don 't think of it .
If we change this paradigm from one of how to get the normality to one on the chance , or potential to be achieving a little bit more dangerous , we can understand the force of so many children , and inviting them to join their pretious capacity with the community .
The anthropologists teaches us that what we , as humans , we 've always wanted to the membres of our community is to be to help .
There 's an evidence that in Olanda , 60 thousand years ago , bringing the old and the subjects , and the subjects with severe ferite , and perhaps thank you for the experience and the survival of these people were the value of the community : Don 't need to have this people like or inuseful .
A few years ago , I was in a market of the citizens where I grew up in that red zone in the northest Pennsylvania .
and I was implemented at a pomodors .
It was summer and I had a little bit of the corts .
I heard this guy , her voice behind me said , " but , it 's not Aimee Mullins . " And I wanted to me , and there 's this man . I didn 't have any idea that it was .
And I said , " Loook , I 'm not going to remember this ? Don 't remember I 've ever met that he said , " But , I don 't remember you to have to met me .
I mean , when we met you were going to hide out of your mother . "
Oh , you know , that guy .
And but certainly , in fact , I was supposed to a camel .
That gentleman was the Dr. Kean , a man I had known for the stories of my mother on that day , because , clearly , I got to go to two weeks .
And therefore , my mother was going to go to vacity , so the man who brought me was a complete expense for my parents .
And , because I was born without the loon , and I had my feet in this foot , and some of the fingers in that , he had to be the messagger , this exrange had to be the bad news .
And he said , " I had to give this provid to your parents that you wouldn 't walk , and that you wouldn 't have the kind of mobility that they have the kind of mobility that they have other children or no independent life independent , and you gave me from the buyer . The amazing thing is that told me that he had gotten artifaces that I had gotten paper in all of my school , which I had vinct in my own own school school , which I was vin my own own own parents ,
that I was hushed with the Girl Scout , you know , the Halloyed , which I had won my bag 's hershy , or all of my witories , and I used them , entertaining their students , by teaching to students of his own medicine school in Hershey and Hershey .
And he called this part of the course , the X factor , the human will be .
Nobody can have a prohire in the order of how it can be and how determinant in a person 's life .
And the DrKean continued to explain and he said , " In my experience , unless you come back , and even though it 's a bad support , and even though it 's a bad support , if it 's leaving the same , a child coming up . "
So you see , Dr. Kean has changed his opinion .
He understood that there is a difference between a medical condition and what each one can do with it .
And there was a change in my thinking during the years in this , if you were asked when I was 15 years old , if I had exchange the prosthetic legs with bones in carne and bone , I wouldn 't have a second .
And I used to get that kind of normality at that time .
If you ask me , I 'm not sure , I 'm not sure .
And it 's because of the experiences I had with them , not for those experiences I had to them .
and , perhaps , change in me , because I 've been exposed to the people who opened me the door to the door of what they hurt me .
You see , everything you need is a person that you need is a person that you 'll show you the epiphany , and you have party of your potential , and you go to somebody your force , the human spirit is so rational , if you can do it and open a door for someone in a door for someone in the best ways .
You 're teaching them to open the door .
in fact , the meaning of the word of education comes out of the root , which means , to pull out what it is in , to bring the potential for the potential .
So again , what 's the potential is we want to pull out ?
There was a case in the 1960s in the Grand shirt , when they were spent by the middle schools .
It 's called the " proof it . " We call it " training " here in the United States . "
It means to separate students dependently on their vote .
And the students with the best voices have a harder program , and better teachers , etc teachers , so they did it for a period of three months , At students with indicated , they said , " good , " people said , they were good .
And at the end of this time of three months , they were having the results at the end of " opinion . " And , clearly , the sad of this study , and they took some of the students from " Otmo " they said , " It 's what happened to the end of the three months .
The ones that were in school , beyond to the ones I left .
And the crucial part of this study was that even the teachers had been reverted .
The teachers didn 't know that was done this change .
And he simply said , " These are the optim students , and these are the people with indeed .
And that 's how they began to teach him .
So , I think the real disability is to have a damaged spirit , and a spirit damaged , and a damaged damn 't hope .
It doesn 't see the beauty .
It has no longer our natural , infant curiosity and our indeed capacity to imagine .
if instead , we can support the human spirit to keep the hope , to see beauty in itself and in others , to be imaginative and curious , hallers that we 're using our strength strings .
When spirit has these quality quality , we can create new reality and new ways of being .
And I want to leave you with a poetry , because of a poem of 130-called Hafiz who made me know my friend Jacques Dembois .
and the poetry is called " The balling only four words . "
Thank you .
