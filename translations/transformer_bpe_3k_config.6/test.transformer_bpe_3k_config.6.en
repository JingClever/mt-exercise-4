A few years ago , here at TED , Peter Skillman introduced a challenge of designing challenge .
And the idea is very simple .
Four of four people have to build the highest tower possible , you can stand up by using 20 spaghetti , using 20 spaghetti , a meter of a spneedle , a meter of shmallow .
The marshmallow must be blue in the top of the tower .
And , even though , it looks very simple , it 's pretty hard , because it costs people to collaborate very rapidly .
So I thought it was an interesting idea , and I started it in a laboratory on design .
And it was a huge success .
And since then , I organized about 70 laborators of this kind of around the world with students , designers and architects , even the development of Fortune companies and 50 .
There is something in this exercise that reveals the important lessons about the nature of collaboration , and I would share some of these lessons with you .
Normally , most people starts with the eastern to be done .
They talk about , you know , they 're going to be able to have , compete for power , then they can spend time planning , organizing .
They have the sketches and predict the spaghers .
They take most of the time to disposition , assembling the spaghers into growing growing structures and , at the end , right when the time is going to go down , somebody out the marshmallow , and caught it on the summit , they do a step back and Ta-up .
They mit the work .
But what happens is , most of the time , is that the " Ta-from " is " transform in a Uh-oh , because the weight of the marshmallow makes collapse and collapse the whole structure .
There 's a certain number of people who have a lot more uh-oh " of others , and there are the worst of business .
They lay , they cheat , they cheat , and they create structures .
And there are , of course , groups that have a lot more tails , and in the best , there are the neodiplomers , there are the neodiplomers of childhood schools .
And it 's amazing .
As Peter says , not only create the higher structures , but they 're the most interesting structures .
And your question is , how is it possible ? Why ? What are they going to do that ?
And Peter said that , " No one of the kids spent time trying to become the director of SpA . " Right . "
They don 't spend time competing for power .
But there 's another reason .
And the reason is that the economy students are formed to find the single best project .
And then I 'm going to do that .
And after , what happens is that when they put the marshmallow in the top , they have no longer , and what happens ?
The crisis .
Is you familiar ? Right .
What children do differently , is that they start from the marshmallow , and they build prototypes , one after the other tening , and then they 're going to hurt the marshmallow , so they have different possibilities of it .
designers recognize that this kind of collaboration is the essence of an iterative process .
And with every version , children have an instantaneous feedback on what it doesn 't work .
So the ability to work on prototypes is essential , but we see how they work different groups .
The average for most people is about 50 centriers , for the students of economics , about half availed , a little bit better , but not very , children , better than many adults .
Who does better than everybody ?
Architects and engineers , thank you .
99 cm is the highest structure that I 've ever seen .
And why ? Because they understand that the triangles and geometrical models are the key to to build stable to build structures .
Then we have the general directors , a little bit better than average .
But this is where it becomes interesting .
If you include an administrator , the group can do a lot better .
It 's unbelievable . It 's a little bit of a , you know , " Vedrai that the group will be able to understand . And why ?
because they 're particularly accomplishment .
Gests the process , they understand it .
And all of the groups that they 're paying attention to work improve , the result of the team .
You know , special dots , and their combination , and their combination to a safe .
If you have 10 groups that they usually work , you have , maybe you 're going to get structures that they 're going to either .
And I tried an interesting experiment .
I thought , let 's get the major for a time .
I put up the 10,000000-dollar team .
What do you think that happened to design students ?
What was the result ?
Here 's what happened .
No one of the team has created a stable structure .
If one of them had built a 2.5 centers , it would bring the prize .
Is it not interesting that a high major impact like this ?
We 've tried again the exercise with the same students .
What do you think happened ?
Now they got the value of a prototype .
The same team , from the worst .
They created the highest structure in the minor time .
So they 're important lessons about incentives about incentives and success .
The reason is this : helping to create digital tools and processes to help groups , video games and visual effects .
And what it does a marshmallow is to help identify identify assumption .
Why is , honestly , every project has his marshmallow , isn 't that ?
The challenge provides a sharing experience , a common language , a common position to build a prototype .
And so , this is the value of the experience , of this simple exercise .
And those of you who were interested , it can go to the marshmallow-challenges .
It 's a blog that you can take a look at how to build the marshmallow .
There are pass for pass .
There are crazy examples from all over the world on how people correges and add the system .
There 's also the world record .
And the most important lesson , I think , is that design is really a sports of contact .
Now , he required the employees of all of the senses , and the most fines , the feelings and manuality to run the challenge that you have in hand .
And sometimes , a little prototype of this experience is what you need to transform a moment . "
And that can really make a difference .
Thank you very much .
We end up having a car here , big , wonderful , beautiful , in the TED weighs , it 's a long time machine .
Everybody in this room have to come in .
You can go back , you can 't go back ; you can 't remain where you 're .
And I would be curious to know what you would choose because I asked him to my friends in the last days , and everybody wants to come back .
I don 't know . They want to go back to before there were the car or Twitter , or " American Idol . "
I don 't know .
I believe that there is a kind of return to the nostalgia , and illusions .
I understand it .
But I 'm not part of that group , I have to admit .
I don 't want to go back , and why I 'm not going to go back , it 's because the chances on this planet are not going to go back , go on this planet .
So I want to go into the machine and I want to go on .
This is the best period that there was on this planet in every field that we can measure : health , wealth , mobility , opportunity , calculus of disease .
There was never a time like this .
My dy-grandparents died , all the first 60 years .
My grandparents got that number to 70 .
My parents are to touch for 80 .
So it 's better that there 's a nine at the beginning of my death .
But it 's not only about people like us , it 's a much bigger than this .
A born child in New Delhi can expect to live as much as the rich man in 100 years ago .
Think about it . It 's an amazing thing .
How does that be true ?
Vaile has killed billions of people on this planet .
It has changed the demography as no war has ever done .
If she went on . Sdry .
We have it unexpected it . It can .
In the rich world , diseases that threatened millions of people only one generation do not exist , basically .
Difterms , rosolia , polio --
someone knows what are they going to be ?
Vaccines , modern medicine , our ability to feeding billions of people , these are triumphers of the scientific method .
And I think , the scientific method , to try things , see if they work , changing them when they don 't work , is one of the great results of humanity .
These were good news .
Unfortunately , they were the good news because there are other problems , and there are other problems , and they 've been quoted many times , for example one of them is that , although everything we 've got got , a billion people in bed in bed in the planet , every day .
This number is growing , with incredible rapidity , and it 's true .
And not only , we used our creativity to fill up the planet .
Acqua points , farm land , rainforests , oil , natural gas , they 're disappearing , and if we 're not going to be disappeared , and if we don 't stand our actions to pull us out of this trouble .
So the question is , can we do that ? I think yes .
I think it 's clear that it 's possible to produce billions of people without violating the land that they live on .
I think it 's possible to do this world of energy without this destroy .
I really think , and no , and no , it 's not illusion .
But here 's the thing that keeps me up at night -- one of the things that keeping me up at night .
We 've never had to scientific progress as we need now , and we 've never been in the position to use them at the best of how we might use it today .
We 're at an incredible pass from incredible events , really , in many of them .
But despite this , I think we should go back centuries , 300 years earlier Illuminism , to find a time in which we 've been fight , a time in which we 've been fight , more vigorosly in the front of how we do now .
People trapped in what they believe , and they do it with a lot of force that we can 't get rid of them .
Not even the truth of them .
Listen , everybody 's right to their own opinion ; they also have right to their opinion to the progress , but you know what you don 't have it right ?
You have no right to your facts . I 'm sorry , you cannot .
I put it a little bit about it .
A decade of years ago , I wrote a story on the vaccines for " The New Yorker , a brief article .
And I was astonishing somebody opponed , which is , after all , which is , after all , the most effective public health care of all the human history .
So I didn 't know what to do , so I did not know what to do , so I wrote the story .
Not much later , I wrote a story about genetically modified food .
Same thing , only bigger .
People were wired .
So I wrote a story about that , and I couldn 't understand why the people would be considered the OGM as " I 'm going to be able to move the molecules in a specific way , instead of alwing nature 's work .
But , I always wrote my work . I wrote the story and I went on .
I mean , I 'm a journalist : we send , let 's go to dinner , end up there .
But these stories from me , and I couldn 't understand why , but at the end .
And the problem was that those phaneas that they were making me impacted .
They were in consciousness , educated people for good .
They were exactly like people in this room .
And the thing that was very --
but then I thought , from , we have to be honest ; we 're at a point on this planet , where we don 't have the same relationship to the progress that there was a time .
We talk about the environment .
We 're talking in ironic with virgolette , using virgolette , " You know , well , there are motivated to do it , and I think we know what they are .
We lost confidence in institutions , in authority , and sometimes in science itself , and it 's comprehensive .
It 's just to do a few names and people understand .
Sernobyl , Bhopal , the Challer , Vioxx , mass destruction , mass destruction instruction .
I mean , every one has his list .
We have questions and problems that we were always right .
So you 're going to be .
Do tomorrow , you pret answers , you pretend .
Don 't do anything for granted .
But here 's the fundamental point : when you have to accept them , and we 're not very good at this .
And I think that 's why we 're in an an epidemic of fear that I had never seen and hopefully never seen .
About 12 years ago , a story , a horrible story , which was an awful story , that there was a legacy between an autism and vaccines versus , paroted and rosolia .
Very frightening .
Hundreds of studies were made to see whether it was true .
And you had to do hundreds of studies ; it 's a important issue .
And finally , they got the data .
They came from the United States , from the Sweden , from the Sweden , from Canada , and everybody was equal , no connection .
It didn 't make a difference . He didn 't do it because we believe the anecdotes , to what we think of , what we think of what we 're thinking about , what it makes us feel real .
We don 't believe a pile of documents from employees of government that show us numbers , and I understand it , I think we all understand it .
But you know what ?
The results have been devastating --
It 's one of the world in which is , the United States is one of the world in which the number of vaccines against deployed .
It 's horrible , and we should be true of ourselves .
It 's terrible .
What happened to do you have to do something like this ?
Now , I realize it . I really understand it .
Think of it , someone here has the morbill ?
Do anyone in the audience has ever seen a person die ?
It doesn 't happen .
In this country doesn 't happen , but it happened 160,000 times in the world last year .
I 'm a little bit of deaths for deaths , 20 every hour .
But because it didn 't happen here , we can take away from the head , and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around to disappears , and ignorance from buildings like Oprah Larry King Live .
And they can do it because they don 't understand the difference between causality and correlation .
They don 't understand that these two things look like equal , but they 're not almost ever .
But it 's something that we have to learn , and we have to learn it quickly .
This man was a hero , Jonas Salk .
He liberated the humanity from one of his worst flags .
Not a fear , no suffering -- the polio , churches -- disappears .
The man in the middle , not as much .
It 's called Paul Offit .
He just created a vaccine against the rotable with other people .
It saved 400 , 500 children every year in the developing world .
It 's bad , right ?
It 's good , if Paul 's not that Paul goes around to talk about vaccines , says how precious they are and that people should simply stop .
And it says in these terms .
So Paul considered a terrorist .
When Paul : It can 't be testimoned , it cannot be testing without a submit .
They call it home because they like to remind them that knows where his children go to school .
Why ? Because Paul created a vaccine .
I don 't need to tell that , but the vaccines are fundamental .
If we can take them , the diseases go back , terrible disease , and it 's going on .
We 've got back to this country .
And it 's going to be worse , and between not very much the children will begin to die of new because it 's just a question of numbers .
And they 're not going to die bill .
The polio ? To you also take that . Why not ?
A couple of weeks ago , and I wrote a couple of weeks ago , and told me that it was a little bit about it .
Nobody told me that before .
She wouldn 't vaccinate his son against the polio .
Neeven dead .
OK .
Why ? Because there is no polio from us . But you know what ?
We didn 't have the polio in the United States .
Now , I don 't know this -- maybe stamattin a guy is sitting on a Lagos in Lagos Angeles , and it 's coming to Los Angeles , now it 's over the Ohio .
It 's going to land in a couple of hours , which is going to be a machine , it 's going to get here in Long Beach and staser participated with a TED .
He doesn 't know it 's not been infected by a paralizing disease , and we don 't know it because that 's how the world works .
This is the planet that we live in . We don 't do that .
We love it .
Everybody took the vitamines ?
Echink , a little bit of antioxes to begin the day .
I know you 've done it because half of Americans do it every day .
They take that stuff , as they take that stuff up to the alternative medicine , and it doesn 't matter how we 're unuseful .
The data will always demonstrate it .
They have the more scure urin it . They don 't do it , almost never do .
But it 's good , you want to spend 28 billion dollars for urine , I 'm with you !
Urina scture . Sure .
Why do we do that ? Why do we do that ?
I think about , we hate the big drug homes .
We take the great government machine . We don 't trust .
And we do good . Our health system does slavery .
It 's cruel to millions of people .
It 's absolutely cold , incredibly cold , even for those of us that we can afford .
So what do we go away , and who do we refugee ?
We 're going to put in the arms of the big placebo .
It 's fantastic . We love the big placebo .
You know , it 's a serious problem because this stuff is a slavery , and we spend billions of dollars .
I have a whole series of examples here .
Nobody of these -- ginkgo -- a frod , echink -- a frog -- I don 't know what it is , but I don 't even know what it is , but we spend billions of dollars , and it 's a frog .
You know , what ? When I say these things , people come to me against , and they say , " What are you interested in ? Lass that people do what you want .
It does be good . "
Do you gue a little ? You 're going to go back .
Because I don 't care about whether it is the secretary of the Department for Salute and the Uhands to say , " Uhm , I don 't have to hear the expert of the mammography , " or if it says a few long-atical cancer that wants to treat patients .
When we put the street the street that brings to replace science and proves with magic and tradition , we 're not going to be .
We don 't like Thabo Mbeki in South Africa .
It killed 400 miles of his conception and continuing to say that barbabies babies , cut up and the next one of the anti-retroviral drugs that we can slow down the AIDS .
Hundreds of thousands of unuseful deaths in a country that has been hit more than any other from this disease .
Please , you don 't get to tell me that there are not consequences for these actions .
There are always there .
Now , the most stupid epidemic in which we are in the middle right now is the war in between sustaff of genetically modified by genetically modified and the elite food of biological food .
It 's an idit diatriba . It 's got to end .
It 's a diatriba on words , on metaphors .
It 's ideology , it 's not science .
Every single thing that we eat , every time of the rice , every practice of practice , every horse of Bruxelles has been modified by the man .
You see , there were no send in the garden of Eden .
There were no melanzane .
There were no Christmas trees . We 've created us .
We did it over the last 10,000 years .
Something has worked and something else not .
And we elected what we didn 't work .
Now we can do this more precise .
And there are risks , of course , there are .
But we can put things like the A vitamin the rice , and this would help millions of people , to take a millions of people , prolunning their life .
Do we want to do that ?
I have to tell you , I don 't understand it .
We 're contrary to the OGM .
Why ?
The things that I feel always of chemical compounds , pesticides , ormons , ormones , we don 't want to enormous farmed with the same thing , it 's wrong .
We don 't want the companies to put a little bit about life .
We don 't want the companies are unique .
You know what my response to this ?
It 's yes . We 're right . We do something .
It 's true , we have a huge food problem , but it 's not science .
It has nothing to do with science .
It 's law , morality , lines on the shapes .
You know that science is not a corporation .
It 's not a country .
It 's not even an idea ; it 's a process .
It 's a process , sometimes you know , you know , but the idea that we shouldn 't afford to afford science to do his work because we have fear is actually very , very clear , and it 's impeding to millions of people to prosperate .
You know , in the next 50 years we 're going to be forced to produce 70 percent of food in more than we do now , 70 percent .
These are the investments in the last 30 years .
Vergognose .
They need it and we don 't need it .
Why ? You know , genetically modified .
We don 't want to encouraging people to eat slavery as well .
Middle billion people eat eat .
It looks a little like a little bit .
But it 's just provided calories . It works .
It doesn 't have nutrients , it doesn 't have any nutrients , but scientists are finding the way of put in this moment .
So a lot of people might eat and run less the risk to become blind .
They wouldn 't die , and you know what ?
It would be very good .
I just ask myself , why are we against ?
I mean , let 's tell you , why are we hurt this thing ?
Just why don 't we want to move the genes and there ?
It 's about moving genes . It 's not about chemicals .
It 's not about our oxxxusion for ormons , or our desire to have greater , better food .
There is no Rice Krispies .
It 's about saving the life of the people 's life , and this is now that we began to understand what it means .
Why -- you want to know it ? -- if we don 't understand it , and we continue to behavior as we 're going to be hurt something that I don 't think we want to eat something which I don 't think we would be able to dry , technological coloniogical colonialism .
There 's no other way to describe what 's going on .
It 's egost , it 's horrible , and we have to stop it .
So , after this conversation conversation , you could ask me , " You still want to go into this ridiculation of time and go to the future ? "
Of course , I want .
It 's stuck on the present now , but we have an incredible opportunity .
We can deal with the time machine as we want .
We have the chance to go where we want , and we 're going to do it where we want .
We have to do these conversations , and we have to think , but when we go into the machine of time , and we 're going to be happy to do that .
I know we can and , as much , I think the world needs to have it right .
Thank you .
Thank you .
And one day , the Los Angeles Times Steve Los Steve Lopez Angeles Times Los Angeles when he heard a beautiful music music .
It was from a man , a man , an a-American man , fascinating , with the husbed traits , without dimora , which was playing a violin that he had only two cords .
I 'm telling a story that a lot of you know , because Steve articles from the basis of a book , which , in followed , came adapted to the great screen , with Robert Downey Jams , who interpret the part of Steve Lopez , and Jamie Foxy in the part of the Nathony Ayers , and Jamie Foxy Ayers , which was interrupt at the Juilliard .
Nathaniel this Juilliard , had a terrible nervous exhaugment , and 30 years later lived in the middle of the Los Angeles in the middle of Los Angeles .
And all of you to read the book of Steve , or looking at the movie to understand not only the beautiful connection of these two men .
I 'm Jane McGonigal . I 'm a video games .
I think about 10 years old online , and my goal for the next 10 is to try to save the world in the real life as it is to try to save the world the online games .
I have a plan , and I consists in convinced more people , including all of you , to spend more time to play play games and interesting .
At the time , we have three billion hours a week playing online .
Some of you may think , " It 's a good time to play . "
maybe too much time , considering how many problems we have to solve in the real world .
Actually , in my research , I pressed the Istitute for the Future , actually is the contrary .
Three billions of week are not minimally enough to solve the world the most urgent issues in the world .
In fact , I think that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we have to increasing that digit .
I calculated that we need is 21 billion hours of game every week .
It 's probably an idea a controversial idea , so you know , so the ripet , to reforce the concept .
If we want to solve problems which hunger , poverty , climate changes , global conflicts , global conflict conflict , I think we have to have the environment to play online , at least 21 billion hours to seventh , for the next decade . No , I 'm serious , really .
That 's why I think that I play is so important to play is to play is so important to survival of the human species . It 's true .
This is a portrait of the photographer Phil Toldan , he wanted to catch the emotion of the game .
So he photographed with players .
And this is a game classic emotion .
If you 're not used to habitual players is possible that you can lose some of this picture .
You probably noticing the sense of urgency , a little bit of fear , but also an intense concentration , a very profound attention , a very profound attention , a very difficult problem .
If you 're habitual players , you 'll notice some details , the folds around the mouth , and around the mouth is an of optimism .
And the daughter surprise .
This is an abitual player to a step from one thing called a " Epician Vittory . "
Ah , it 's a term that you 've heard . OK .
So we have habitual players between us .
An victory is an extraordinary result that you don 't seem to yourself until you get it .
It 's almost beyond the imagination of the imagination , and when you get a shock to find out what you 're really capable . This is a epy witory .
This player is a pace step from a ep-winning step .
And this is the expression that we need to see about millions of people in the world , as we face the obstacles of the next hundred years .
Unfortunately , this is the expression that we see in the life of all days as we try to deal with urgent problems .
This is the expression that I call . " I 'm not Brate . " And I 'm going to do it . You see that ? "
I 'm with the expression , " I 'm not Brava . "
This is a great deal in my old neighborhood of Berkeley , California , where I did the PhD on why we 're more good at game in the game that in real life .
And this is a lot of a lot of habitual players : we feel that in reality .
And I don 't mean , " just as a success , even though the success is part : we get more results in the online .
But I mean , I mean , " good at all of motivated to do something important , inspired to collaborate and cooperating .
And when we 're in a online world , I think that a lot of us become the best versions of ourselves , the most capable to help without predict , more capable to help to focus on a problem for all the time , to get up after a failure and try it again .
And in real life , when we face a failure , when we face an obstacle , we often don 't feel anxious , we don 't feel anxious , maybe depressed , frustrated or movie .
We 're not going to try to do these feelings , it just doesn 't exist in a game .
So this is what I wanted to study at university .
What is that in a game package us to feel that we can 't get any result ?
How can we bring those feelings from games and applies them in the real world ?
So I studied games as World of Warcraft , which is really the ideal environment to solve problems in collaborative .
And I started to noticing some things that make the epites so possible in online worlds .
The first one is that , when you look at one of these writing games , especially in World of Warcraft , there are a lot of different characters that are trusting a mission to save a mission to save a mission to save the world .
But not a mission any : any perfectly open mission to your current level in the game . Right ?
So you can complete it .
They never give you an impossible challenge .
But it 's the limit of your skills . So you 've got to do it seriously .
But there 's no disocks into the World of Warcraft , you don 't spend the time to turn to the pollyss , there 's always something to do .
And there 's a lot of collaborators .
Everywhere you go , hundreds of thousands of people , ready to join a full of order to complete your mission .
It 's not something so common in real life , this feeling that we have a lot of collaborators .
And there 's this narrative , this narrative that inspire inspire , and what we 're doing .
And then we get all that positive feedback --
you 've heard about increasing level , and you know , one in intelligence .
We don 't get that kind of feedback in real life .
When I 'm going to leave this stage , we 're not going to talk about a public , and 1 in bizarre ideas .
I didn 't get that kind of feedback in real life .
Now , the issue of collaborative environments as World of of Warcraft is that gives so much satisfaction is that it gives so much satisfaction , that we decide to spend all the moments , that we decide to spend all the time in these game worlds .
It 's simply better than the reality .
It 's for this that , finally , collectively all the players of World of Warcraft have spent 593 million years of Azeroth virtual problems of Azeroth .
This is not necessarily a negative thing .
But put it in perspective : 5.93 million years ago , it was the time that one of our ancestors stood up up .
That was the first first walking .
OK , so when we talk about how long we 're investing in the play , the only manufactured to think about it , is to talk about the parlit of the human temples , which is an extraordinary , but also useful , because we 've discovered that we 're going to play , we 're changing what we 're able as able as a human being , we are able to collaborate more and more heart .
This is true , I think .
So , let 's look at this interesting statistics .
It was published recently from a researcher to Carnagie Mellon .
The typical young average today in a country with a strong culture of habitual players , will have spent 10,000 hours playing online , at 21 years old .
10,000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons .
First of all , for the children in the United States 10,0000-hours is the exact number of hours to go to school as indeed to the maturity if you 're all the days .
So , we 've got a whole parallel of education in which young people learn as good players .
And some of you will probably read the new Malcolm Gladwell , " Fuoriclasse . "
If you 've done it by his theory , the theory of the 10,000 hours for success .
It 's founded on a very good research in cognition in cognition , which is that if we have 10,0000-hours of study in the age of 21 years , we 're going to genes in that field .
We 're going to be good at that something as the best people in the world .
So , what we have now is a whole generation of young people who are genes of the game .
So , the question is , " Exactly , what do they become good at these players ? "
because if we could understand what it is we would have to disposition a amount of human resources without precedented .
This is the number of people in the world , at least one hour a day to play online .
These are our game genes .
500 million people who are extraordinary good -- in something .
And in the next decade , we 're going to have another billion of habitual players that are extraordinarily good at that something .
If you already didn 't know it , this is what we expect : the video games industry is developing platforming platforms , which will work with the cell network instead of the mobile phone networks instead of the world , in particular in India , China , Brazil , in particular , China , Brazil , Brazil , pounds ,
There 's a billion player in the next decade .
This is going to take us to 1.5 billion players .
So I began to think of what these games are transforming us in genes .
These are four aspects that I 've detected . The first one is a optimism .
OK . Think of it as a self-motivation .
A optimism is the wish to act immediately to deal with an obstacle , together with convinction to have a reasonable reasonable hope of success .
The habitual players always belief that one is possible and it 's possible and it 's worth to try it , and do it now .
Habitual players are not with your hands .
abitual players are virtuous in the tbeing a social robust .
There are a lot of interesting research that showing how we are better with other people who played with them , even though they 've played us .
And the reason is that it takes a lot of confidence to play with someone : we trust to spend their time with us , which is going to deal with us , which is going to deal with the same objectives , and that will remain up to the game .
So , to play together by building the bits of the confidence and cooperation .
The results that we really have the most robust social relations .
I love it .
You know , there 's a reason for which the average World of Warcraft player of Warcraft player a week , almost a part-time job .
It 's because we know , as we 're playing , which we 're plenty to work hard , rather than relaxing , or losing time .
We know that we 're optimized , as a human being , to work worth something that has meant .
And the habitual players are disposed to work workers , if it 's assigned a task .
And finally , one meaning .
Habitual players love to be associated to be associated to planetary stories .
For example , a little information to help create a context .
You know all of Wikipedia , the biggest wiki in the world .
The second wiki bigger in the world , with almost 80,000 articles is the wiki of World of Warcraft . Five million people use it every month .
They have more information on the World of Warcraft in the Internet , which on any other wiki in any other wiki in the world .
They 're building a ep-the-boundary .
They 're building a source of the World of Warcraft .
OK , these are the four superpoterms that together a single thing .
Habitual players are individuals of great optimism doctors .
These are people who believe that they 're individually able to change the world .
The only problem is that they believe that we can change virtual worlds , but not the real real .
This is the problem I 'm trying to solve .
There 's an economic named Edward Castronova .
Her studies are brilliant . It 's studying why people invested so much time , energy and money , in the online worlds .
And he said , " We 're looking at what it makes nothing less than a mass extense towards virtual worlds and environments . "
And it 's an econom , so it 's rational , and it says -- not as me , I 'm an exuberant --
But he says that this is a perfectly feels that this is a perfectly sensated thing , because the habitual players can get more in the online worlds that in real life .
They can have more solid social relations in a game that doesn 't in real life .
They have a better feedback , and they feel more reward in a game that doesn 't in real life .
So , in fact , for now , it 's a perfectly reasonable reasonable for habits , to go over time in virtual worlds that I agree that this is reasonable reasonable , for now , but it 's not , in any way , an ideal way . We have to begin to make the real world more like a game .
This is inspiration from something that happened to 500 years ago .
These are dades of anti-bones of pecorders . Before we have joysticks and clean wonderful achieves . And these represent the first instruments . And these represent the early tools .
If you know the screen of the ancient Greek , Erodote , maybe you know this story .
It 's the story of who invented games and why .
It 's narrooms that games , particularly the dades games , were invented in the realm of the Lidia , during a carpet time .
It turns out that pathy was so several , that the king of the Like of Lidia decided to do something unthinkable .
People suffered , the population was at ripped , was an extreme situation , they needed an extreme solution .
So , according to Erodote , they invented games and emanated a valid law for everything .
One day , everybody would eat .
The next day , everybody would play .
And they immersed so deeply in the dades games , from the moment to play is so involved , and they dive us into a jewelry jewers , which ignored the fact of not to eat .
And so one day they played , and one day they ate .
And according to Erodote , spent like this 18 years , survivally , and playing that following the following .
I think this is exactly the way we use games at the day .
We use games to fix the games of the real world 's suffering .
We use the games to move away from everything that doesn 't work in our real environment , from everything that doesn 't satisfaces in real life , and we get what we need from games .
But we don 't have to stop here .
This is really interesting : Second Erodote , after 18 years , the heart was not going to improve , so it was going to play a last piece of dades .
And I was the whole realm of half , they played a dades , and the winers of that participated the game participated to an adventure .
And they went to a Lidia , and they went to try to a new land where to live , and just behind the numbers of people to survive with resource resources , with hope to bring their civilization from some other side , where they could prosperse .
It 's a little bizarre , right ?
But it recently , studies on the DNA have revealed that the Etrusks that they would take the same DNA of the ancient people in the same DNA of the anti-habitants of Like .
So , recently , scientists have suggested that history from Erodote is a real story .
And geologists have found evidence of a global cooling that was almost 20 years to explain the pathway .
So , this incredible story could be true : could have actually saved their culture by playing , refugames for 18 years to be so inspired , and to know how to come to come so inspired , and to know how to come up with the point to save the civilization of civilization .
OK , we can do it .
Let 's go to the World of Warcraft from 1994 .
It was the first strategy in real time of World of Warcraft . This 16 years ago .
They played for 18 years , we played in Warcraft for 16 years .
I say , we 're ready for our game .
They would half the world 's population for a new world .
It 's from here that the idea of 21 billion hours of play a week of play a week .
We know that half of us , you know , you know , to go a day to play a day , to when we don 't solve the real world problems .
Imagine what you 're going to ask , " How are we going to solve the real world problems in a game ? " Well , this is what I 've dedicated to my work during last last years , pressed Istitute .
In our offices of Palo Alto have this stay that we express our idea of how we should relate to how we should relate to the future .
We don 't want to predict the future .
What we want to do is -- the future .
We want to imagine the scenarians from the best results , and then we want to give people to transform them concrete .
We want to imagine writing witories to give people the instruments to make them .
I 'm going to show you three games that I realized and I 'm a attempt to giving people to create the epic wrote in their future .
This is " Mr. "
We did this game in 2007 .
It 's an online game in which you 're trying to survive a charge of oil .
It 's not real , but we published enough , but we published enough material online to believe that it is , and to make real life life as if we were in a sign . So , when you go into the game , and it gives you the game , it gives you news , and it gives you noticed it in real time , the things that are not available , the impact on the distribution of oil , things that are not available , the impact on the distribution of food ,
the impact on transport , if the schools are closed , if you have to think of how you live , and you have to think of how you live in your life , if this is real .
We had this game with 1,700007 players in 2007 , and we looked at them for the three years , and what I can tell you is that it 's a transform .
Nobody wants to change the way they live in because it 's a good thing for the world or because it 's a good thing for the world or because it 's a need to do it .
But if you dive them in an adventture and say , " We don 't have oil .
This is an incredible story ! One adventure that you can participate it !
Sphysical to see how you survive as a survive . "
Most of our players and then kept habits that has learned in the game .
So , for the next game , I wanted to save the world , we decided to get higher , at a bigger problem for oil .
We did a game called Superstruct , at the Istitute for the Future , and premise it was a supercomputer that humanity has only only been 23 years on this planet .
The supercomputer is called " System of Allerta of the Global Estinition . " Obviously . "
We asked people to reach online almost as in a Jerry Bruckheimer .
Jerry movies of Jerry Bruckheimer , provided a team : there is an astronautony , scientists , and they all have something to do to save the world , but in our game , instead of having only five people in the team , but in our game , instead of sudden team , and it 's done part of the world , and it 's done your inventing future of the energy , the future of security . And the future of the prediction of the future of the security .
8,000 people have played for eight weeks , have generated 500 solutions that you can find if you go online , and you 're trying to Google " Superstruct . "
And finally , the last game , it 's going to begin three . This is a game made with the Istitute of the World Bank .
If you complete the game you 're going to be certified by the Istitute of the World Bank , as Social Innovator , class of 2010 .
Lavoring with university disappears for sub-Saharan Africa , we 're aging them to learn the techniques of social innovation .
There 's a story of comic comics , and it increases , thank you very much as local knowledge , sustainability , imagination and invent .
And I 'm going to invite all of you to share this game with young , everywhere in the world , particularly in the developing areas , which might be able to make benefit from one to begin to imagining the world .
It 's now to conclude .
I want to ask a question .
What do you think that 's going to happen ?
We have all of these incredible players , we have these games that are pilots of things that we could do , but no one of these has still saved the real world .
Well , I hope that you agree with me that the habitual players are a human resource that we can use to do work in the real world , that games are a powerful platform for the change , that we have these incredible superpowers , a game productivity , which is a joyful plant , the ability to be a game , this optimism , this optimism optimism , this optimises of a meant .
And I really hope that we can come up to play games to play games that have important , to survive this planet for another century , and my hope is that that you can join me in making and participating games like this .
When I look forward to the next decade , two things are certain : we can do anything that we can do the future , and we can play whatever we do .
So , I say , we 're beginning to games that will change the world .
Thank you .
For a few time , I was interested in placebo effect , it may seem a strange thing that a magician is that you don 't think about it from my point of view that is something real . " In other words , " In other words , the sugar pills of sugar pills have a sugar effect in some study , the effect , only because the person thinks you know , the person thinks you know , you know ,
that what 's happening is to a drug or something like that --
The therapy of the pain , for example , if you have a measurable effect in the body called placebo effect .
Something that fake becomes something true for perception that you have .
I want to show you a magic rudimental trick , very easy .
And I 'm going to show you how it works . This is a trick that 's present in all the books for children in the earthquanta .
I learned it from only Cub ScoMagic Scout Magic .
And so I 'm going to explain it for you and so I 'm going to explain it .
And so I 'm going to explain to you why I explain it .
Here 's what happens .
The hell , which you can examine ; my hand , you can examine .
And I 'm just going to hold my wide , like this .
Time on the manic .
To be sure that you have no or save from my manic manic .
And I 'm going to strings my wild like this .
So I think you can see that something can go . So I 'm going to be here on or down from my manic manic .
And the purpose of this is simple .
I 'm going to open my hand , and if it all went well , my dwell magnetism , my animal magnetism will trackle the hell .
So , in fact , so I 'm hadn to his place that I can take it , and the colmer doesn 't falls .
Nothing goes up or my handle .
no trick . You can examinate anything .
Ta-da !
This is a trick that I often teach children .
that they 're interested in the magic , because you can learn a lot about how they 're going to study this trick , even though it 's very simple .
Many of you in this room will know .
Here 's what Tengo on my hand .
I say , I said , my wildly .
to make sure that anything saving or from my manic manic , this is a lie .
The reason I 'm holding the wrist is because this is the secret of illusion .
And the moment that my hand is moving away from you , this finger here , my index here , my index , my index , in a position that was , in a position that was in a position that was in a position of the way .
There is somebody who didn 't have a childhood here .
It 's like this , right .
And when I 'm walking around my finger ,
We can talk about why it 's ingannevoles , because you don 't notice that there are three fingers here because the mind , and the way that it processing the information , not count , one , two , three . Loook .
But it 's not the point . Right ? And when I open my hand , Obviously remains attacked not through the animal magnetism , but by having my indeed here .
And when I close my finger , the same thing , when I go back , this movement is the finger .
I 'm going to hold it up .
It 's a trick that you can do with your friends and close . Thank you .
Now , what does this have to do with placebo effect ?
I read a study , a year ago , a year ago I read the mind .
I 'm not a doctor or a researcher , so it was a surprising thing .
It looks like if you take a little white placebo in the form of a white pill , let 's look like an aspirine , just a white pill , just a white circular pill , has a misurable effect .
But if you change the shape , and you give placebo , the shape of a smaller , and of blue blue blue , and you printing a letter is visual .
Even no one of the two drug has no drug -- they 're sugar pills .
But a white pill is not effective as a blue pill .
What ?
But anyway , it 's not here that end up .
The capsus are more effective than shapes of every form .
A colored capsule , which is a part of one and red on the other is better than one of a capsule .
The dosage has his role .
One pill two times a day is not so effective as three pills -- I don 't remember the statistics . I don 't remember the statistics .
But the point is --
that these dosages have a role .
And it also has a role .
And if you want the definitely to use a needle .
Right ? A syringe with something -- a couple of c.c.c.c.m.
you start in a patient --
This is a very strong their mind , much stronger than the white of the white pills .
It 's real , this graph -- I 'm going to show you another time when we 're going to have a slide .
The point is that the white pill is not effective like that blue is not effective as it is not effective as a needle .
And nobody has pharmaceutical quality .
It 's just your believes that makes them real in your copro and strength the effect .
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and apply it to a magic trick .
And to do something that is a truck up and make it real real .
And we know from that study when you want a effect you have to use the needle .
This is a seven inches of seven inches , Very appointed .
It 's a little sterilization .
This is my meat . This is not Damian .
This is my skin . This is not a special hollywodian effect .
I 'm going to huck my skin and get this needed to the opposite part .
If you try to nausea -- if you know easily -- I did it for some friends in the albergo camera , the other night , and for some of you that I didn 't know , and a woman 's almost came up .
So if you tried to be easily , I suggested that you don 't watch for the next 30-- actually , you know , I 'm going to do the first bad part of this .
You can see , you can look at another part .
Here 's what happens , right here , the beginning of my lower lower part of my arm , I just do a little hole .
I 'm sorry . To I 'm impressive ?
And now a little bit through my skin , and out the other side , like that .
Now , we 're in the same position that we were with the trick .
More or not you count my fingers now , right ?
So I 'm going to show you . Here 's one , two three , four , five . Yes , OK .
I know what people think about when you see this .
They think , " Surely it 's not going to be stupid to huck the skin just to have a little bit of a little bit . "
So , let me let me leave you a piece .
How it looks like ? Actually well .
Yes , I know , I know , I don 't have this good . "
People in the rooms are coming in .
Let me show you close to it .
This is really my skin . It 's not a special Hollywood special .
This is my meat , and I can turn it around .
Sorry , if you feel bad look at another part , you don 't look .
People at the bottom , or that 's going to look at a few years old , " Well , it 's clear that you have a few effect , but if he was true .
you see there 's a hole here and a hole here , if it was true . "
All right , I 'm going to get out a bit of blood for you .
Here 's here .
Normally to the needle .
I could see my arm , and I would show you that there are no ference .
But I think in this context and the idea of taking something of fake and turn it into something true , and I 'll leave it from the stage .
We 're going to see a several times in the next few days . So , thank you very much .
So , in my life , I met a lot of fish .
I 've only loved two .
The first one , it was more than one of a passionate story .
It was a beautiful heavior , carnose , adconsistent one of the most sold on the menu .
that fish !
What was even better , it was from a dotstandards of the most elevated sustainability of environmental sustainability .
So , you hear you place with the consciousness to sell it .
I was involved in a relationship with this beauty for several months .
One day , the head of the company called me , and he asked me to talk to a dedicated event sustainability of the farming .
" Of course , " I said . "
This was a company that he tried to solve what became an unimaginable problem for our chef .
How do we continue to have the fish in our menu ?
During the last 50 years , we weighed in the same way that we 've been sat the ground .
The destruction was tremendous .
90 percent of the big fish , the ones that like this so much of the tons , the waves , the saves , the heavy , the heavily fish are reduced .
There 's no almost nothing .
So , we please , or less the acquiriculture , becomes part of the fish , is going to be part of our future .
There 's a lot of contrary arguments .
You know , the heavy fish , for the least most of them , and they 're inefficient . You take the tune for example .
A big problem is that there 's a great deal with 15 to one .
This means that it takes 15 to be wild of wild fish to get a baby lishment .
It 's not very sustainable .
And it 's not a big one .
So here 's then , finally there was a company that he tried to do this in the right way .
I wanted to help them .
The first day of the event , I telephone call the companies of the company .
Let 's call it Don .
" Don , " I said , " so you 're very famous to do , you 're famous to do that far away , in the open sea , which you don 't pollution . "
" Exact , " he said , " We 're so far from the coast that our shoes are dilues , not focused . "
And then you add , " We 're basically a world . "
" The rate of conversion ? 2.5 to one said .
" The best sector in the sector . "
2.5 to one , fantastic .
" 2.5 to one thing ? What do you give the fish ? "
" sustainable Protein , he said .
" Great , " I said . " And I wonder the phone call .
And that night , I was in bed , I thought , what the hell is a sustainable protein ?
So the next day , a little first of the event , called Don .
And I said , " Don , do you give me some sustainable examples ? "
He said he didn 't know it , and he would ask around .
Well , I talked to a little bit of people in the company , and no one severed response .
Finally , I talked to with the biologist .
We also call him him Don .
" Don , " I said , " Don you make some sustainable example ? "
Well , he mentioned some of the fish , and then he said , " Look at me . "
I said , " Do you know ? "
He said , " Yes , you think , skin , bones , bones , waste waste processed . "
I said , " What percentage of your eat is made ? "
I thought , say , two percent .
" Well , it 's about 30 percent said . "
And I said , " Don , what is there 's a sustainable to give the pollo to eat ? "
There was a long pauses on the telephone , and then he said , " There are too much in the world . "
I told you about this fish .
No , not because they 're one of those virtuous loving good food and traditional .
Well , to say the truth are .
No , in fact , I 'm sorry about this , because , you know , you know , the fishing , the fish knew of pollo .
The second fish is a story of love .
It 's a romantic story that you know the fish and the most of the fish .
I ate it for the first time in the south of the Spain .
A journalist of my journalist of this fish .
Pratically , he had to meet us .
He came to the table , he had a brilliant color , almost scintiling .
The chef made it too much .
Basically , the double twice as much as it was .
Incrediably , it was so delicious .
Who is able to make a fishing fish , so good after you 've been there ?
I don 't know , but this guy .
Camian Miguel .
It 's actually called Miguel .
No , he didn 't have the fish , and it 's not a chef .
At least , not the sense that we mean .
It 's a biologist in Vet . The Palma , which is a height in the sudoctor of the Spaiders of the Western Western River .
Fine to the ' 80s to the ' 80s .
They had a bovine on what it was essentially a buildings .
They had to realize the land building a series of channeled channels conwant to so the water so .
Well , they cannot do it work out of this not from the economic view .
And , from an ecological view , it was a disaster .
He killed something like 90 percent of the birds and , considering the place , it 's a lot of birds .
So in 1982 , a Spanish company with an environmental consciousness bought the ground .
What do they do they do ?
They reverse the lower of the bottom .
They actually invert the internit .
Instead of conscious water away from the ground .
They have all the channels .
They created a 27 mile fishes from 27 mile acres , anguille musters , anguille , and this process , Miguel and this process , Miguel , and this invertirate from the ecological destruction .
The farming is incredible .
I mean , you 've never seen something like this .
Loook at the horizon , which seems to be a million miles , and all that you see are the inhonests and this rich , dense land .
I 've been there a little Miguel .
It 's an amazing guy three quarters Charles Darwin and a quarter Crocodile Dune .
OK ?
First , indicates a white rare .
And then I explain the mineral need of the fitoplancton , then you see a kind of raging of the Tanzania .
It turns out that Miguel has spent a lot of his career to the National Park Mikumi in Africa .
I asked him how he became a tale of fish .
He said , " Well , I don 't know anything fish .
I 'm an expert in relationship . "
And then you 're going to launch back to the rare on bird , algae and weird plants .
Don 't sentence , all this was very fascinating , which was really fascinating , which is , as a biotic community .
Yeah , it 's interesting , but I was in love with it .
And my head was continued to rethink of that delicious heavy fish that I had eat the previous night .
So , I said , " Miguel , what makes your fish so good ? "
He said the alge .
" I know , I know , the alge , the fitoplancton , yes , yes , it 's incredible .
But your fish , what do you eat ?
What 's your likely conversion rate ?
Well , he responds to me to how their own is a rich system so rich that the fish eat exactly what they missing in an self-ethic environment .
The plant , the biomass , the oplancton , is the zooplancton , is all that feeding the fish .
The system is so healthy it completely .
There 's no eat me .
Have you ever heard of a lift that is not giving us eating the animals ?
More later , I was driving around the ground with Miguel , and I said , " In a place like this , it seems like this natural different from any farming that I 've ever seen , as you do measuring the successful ? "
In that precisely moment , it was like the record of an ordered movie .
And we looked at the corner , and we see a scene between the incredible thousands and thousands of fenicotteres and thousands of fenyed by eye .
" That 's success , he said . "
" Look at their pance , they 're rose .
They 're banking . "
Banchasing ? I was completely confuse .
I said , " Miguel , but are not banking with your fish ? "
" Yeah , " he said . "
" We lose about 20 percent of the fish and the eggs to fishes for birds away .
Last on last year , there were 600,000 birds more than 250 species .
It has become the largest and one of the most important private health care for birds in all Europe . "
And I said , " Miguel , but a population population of bird is not the last thing that you would like in a fish lift ? "
See the head , no .
He said , " We 're going to stand in a extended way .
This is a network .
Fenicopters eat the leg .
The leg are eating the fitoplancton .
So the more of the fenicotteres of the fenicotter is the system . "
OK , so we reassumption . We 're not going to be eating the animals and measured his successful to the health of his predators .
A fishes of fish , but also a bird for bird .
Ah , by the way , those fenyles shouldn 't even be there .
They have the nest in a distant city 150 miles where the nest conditions are better for building .
Every morning , they fly for 150 miles , and they get to the farm , and every night , you get 150 miles for the back .
They do it because they 're able to follow the white line of the A92 .
At the serious .
And I thought I was a kind of like the penguins , so I looked at Miguel .
And I said , " Miguel , they want to 150 miles up to it up for 150 miles of night to go back ?
They do it for their little ? "
And he looked at me as I had just cited a song of Whitney Houston .
He said , " No , they do it because food is better . "
I didn 't talk to you about the skin of my fish that was delicious , and I usually don 't like the skin of the fish .
I don 't like abustoled , I don 't like it .
It 's the sounds like this asphalt .
It 's never nearly .
And yet , when I hired it to that south south of Spain didn 't know anything in the fish .
He had a sweet , and he was like to give a dise to the ocean .
I said this to Miguel , and he annued him .
He said , " The skin is like a spay .
It 's the last defense before anything in the body of the fish .
It 's evolved for impurity . "
And then you add , " But our water doesn 't impurity . "
OK . A lift that doesn 't feed his fish .
A farming that measured the success of his predators .
And then I realize that when he says that the farmers don 't have impurity a lot of it , because the water that fluds up in that farming is from the river , which is a river that is a river that it brings up with all the things that the rivers tend to be able to bring each other day contamints .
And when it comes down the system and the water is more clean when it comes .
The system is so healthy , which can clear water water water .
So , not only a farming that it doesn 't feeding his animals not only a farming that measurements measurements that it 's literally a clear , which is literally a purifection of water , and not only for those fish but also for you .
Because when the water comes out , the Atlantic .
It 's a drop in the ocean , I know , but I do the benefit , and you should do it because this story of love as a romantic love for how romantic love is also instructive .
You could say that it 's a recipe for the future of good food is that you 're talking about fish that you 're talking about fish that .
So what we need now is a new radical conception of radical agriculture in which food is really good .
But for a lot of people , this is a little too radical .
We 're not reality , we 're passionate about food .
We are among .
We love the small farmers .
We love the little familiar farms .
We talk about the local food land .
We have biological .
And when you say that these are the things that are going to make the future of good food , someone somewhere stood up , and says , " Hey you , I think of being able to feed , but how do you think we can feed the world ?
How do you think we could feed the world ? "
Can I be synthy ?
It 's a question that I don 't like .
No , not because we 're going to produce much more calories to be able to feed the world .
A billion people suffering the hunger today .
A billion -- the more than how many of us have ever been -- because of the enormous amount of the complex amount of the complex amount .
You see , I don 't like this question because he determined the logic of our food system in the last 50 years .
To you look at the weather herbivators , chemicals , chemicals to terrain , and all this time the agriculture has simply asked , " If we 're able to feeding more people in the economic way , what is wrong with what we do ? "
This was the motivation .
It was the justify .
It 's been the plan of U.S. agriculture .
We should call it for what it is , an industry in liquidation an industry that 's fast herodying the ecological capital that makes the same kind of production possible .
This is not an industry , and it 's not agriculture .
Our lander today is not threatened forniture , but for the fresources in decreases , not for the last mechanical invention , but for fresh water , not for the fress , but for fresh water , not for fresh water , but for forests , but for forests , for forests , but for the fishes in the sea .
You want to feed the world ?
Let 's start asking us , how are we going to make ourselves feed ?
Or better , how can we create the conditions that are feed to every local community to feed itself ?
To do that , we don 't look at the model of the future .
It 's an old and stick model .
It 's all about capital , chemistry and machines , and it never really produced anything good to eat .
Instead , looking at the ecological model .
It 's what 's about two billion years of the work .
Let 's look at Miguel , at the farmers like Miguel to hands and farmers that are not just performed in themselves to farms that rebuild instead of consuming farmers that are experts in extensively , rather than just intensively alevators that are not just producers , but expert experts in relationships , because they are the ones that are the ones even experts in the knowledge .
If I need to be synthy , they 're really better than I 've ever been .
You know , it 's good , because if that 's the future of good food , it 's going to be delicious .
Thank you .
I grew up with a stopped diet with an ferrecience .
I had a schooly high school , an hour back and forth every day .
And I was always immersed in a book , a phantascience book , which was carrying to my mind in other worlds , and satisfaced , in form narrative , that I had .
And that curiosity would manifest in the fact that every time I wasn 't at school , I was out in the boss , and frogs , frogs , frogs , snaked them to the microscope .
I was a real geek of science .
But it was always trying to understand the world , to understand the world , understanding the limitations of possible .
And my love for phantascience , actually seemed to respect the world around me , because what was happening in the late ' 60s -- we were going to go to the moon , Jacques Cousteau , and Jacques Cousteau came into our lands with great documentary world , Jacques Cousteau came into our jobs , and a wonderful world that we can 't imagine .
So , all it seemed to give my passion for phantoy .
And I was an artist .
I knew how to draw . I knew about it .
And because there were no video games , or this saturation of movie generated computers , nor all these images in the media landscape , I had to create these images in my head .
From children , when we read a book , we all had to take a book of the author , put something on the screen of our tests .
And so , my answer was to paint , drawing creatures , alien creatures , aliens , aliens , all this stuff .
The mathematics of mathematics was always drinking behind the book .
This is because creativity had to find a way away .
And it happened to be an interesting thing : the Jacques Cousteau programs were involved to the fact that there was a alien world right here .
I would not be going to go to a alien world on a spacecraft .
It was very unlikely .
But that was a world where I could go to really , right here on the earth , more rich and exotic and exootic what I would ever have imagining these books .
So , I decided that I would be going to become a motor to 15 years old .
And the only problem I was living in a little Canada , to 600 miles from the ocean near .
But I didn 't leave me .
I looked at my father until he found a dive school of dive in Buffalo , New York , just spent the end where we lived .
And so I was able to take the certified in a full of the YMCA in the winter in Buffalo , New York .
And I wouldn 't see the ocean , the real ocean , for two years , until we 're going to go to California .
From the last 40 years , I spent about 3,000 hours , I spent about 3,000 hours , and 500 of these submersibles .
And I learned that the depth of the ocean , even the several ocean , which is surprising the oceans of our imagination .
The imagination of nature is without confined in our human imagination .
Again , I 'm intideed by what I see when I immersions .
And my story of love with the ocean continues , the stronger than never been .
But when I picked up a career , I chose to do movie .
It seems to be the best way to concilize this smania to tell stories with smania to create images .
And , as a kid , I was constantly comics and so on .
So I had to do film was the only way to put together images and stories .
Everything came back .
And of course the stories that I picked up were stories of phantascience : " Termintator , " Aliens " and " The Abyss and " The Abyss . "
And with " The Abyss , " I joined my love for depth and immersions to do a movie .
So , I brought the two steps .
From " The Abyss " came out something interesting that was solving a specific problem in that film , which is to create the kind of a liquid water creature .
And so he was born the first character to die and animated computers that had ever seen in a movie .
And even though the movie has not done a lot of money , I would say that , despite was repaid , I was testimoned by this magic .
You know , it 's the law of Arthur Clarke for which every technology is inguible by the magic .
They were seeing something magic .
And this was very excited .
And I thought , " Fantastic , this is something that must be adopted in the movie art . "
So , with " Terminator 2 , " my next movie , I went a lot of beyond .
Lavoring with the Industrial Light and Magic , we created the liquid metal in that movie . The successful thing was going to work .
And it worked . And we 've done a magic created a magic .
And we got the same result with an audience .
But we 've got a little bit more with that movie .
So , by tracking a line between these two points of experience , I came to the conclusion that this would be a whole new world of creativity for the movie artists .
So , I 've put up a company with Stan Winston , my caro friend Stan Winston , which was the main truckers and designers at that time , and we called it Digital Domain .
And the principle of the society was to leave us to the past , the optical processes and so on , and so on , and then go directly to the digital production .
And so we 've done , and we gave a competitive advantage for a little bit .
But we 're back to half the ' 90s in the ' 90s of creatures and characters , which is what we had founded the society .
So , I wrote this textbook called " " Hatar " with the intention to the massive effectively , generated to computers , with human characters and emotional characters in computers , and all of the main generated computers , and all of the main generated computers .
And the whole was remadied to the mitter .
The kids of societies have told me that we 're not going to be able to do this for a little bit .
So , I took this , and I did this film of a big ship .
I 've been throwing this as " Romeo and Juliet and Juliet on a ship . "
It would be a story of love , a passionate story , a passionate movie .
Seretly , what I wanted to do was immerged to see the relationship of " Titananic . "
That 's why I did that movie .
And it 's the truth . The study didn 't know it .
But I convinced them . I said , " We 're going to dive into the relationship .
We 're going to use it for the beginning of the movie .
It 's going to be very important . It 's going to be a great marketing . "
And I convinced them to finance a expedition .
It seems to be crazy . But this brings us to imagination that reality .
Because we really created a reality and six months later , I found on a a submersible Russian submersible , in the North Atlantic of the North , looking at the true Titananic from a , not in a high-definition , but really for it .
I 've been sleep .
And it took a lot of preparation , we had to build the movie and lights and lights and a lot of other things .
But I 've been trained by those profound deep deep dive , it was like a space mission .
where it was highly technical , and they would required enormous planning .
You 're going to put you on this capsule , you go to this darkly environment where there are no hopes to be saved , which you can 't go back to yourself .
And I thought , " Fantastic . It 's like living in a phantascience .
It 's really great . "
And so , I was deployed by the depths of the depth of the ocean .
Of course , curiosity , scientific component .
It was all .
It was curiosity . It was imagination .
And it was an experience that Hollywood was not able to offer .
Of course , I could imagine a creature and create a visual effect . But I couldn 't imagine what I could see out of the danger .
In our successful expeditions , I 've seen creatures with hydrothermal airs and , sometimes , things that I 'd never seen before , things that no one had seen before , which is actually not even described by science to the time we saw them and imagine .
So I was all taken from this , and I had to do more .
So I took a curious decision .
After the success of " Titanic , " I said , " OK , I 'll put my daily job of the Hollywood regist of Hollywood , and I do the explorer at a while . "
So , we started planning these expeditions .
We found us to go to Bismark and explore it with robotic vehicles .
We went back to the Titananic .
We had little robots that we had a little robots that we had the fiber eight .
And the idea was to go to and do an survival , which had never been done .
Nobody had ever looked inside of the relationship . They didn 't have miles to do it , so we created the technology to do it .
So here I am on the Titanic bridge , sitting in a submersible , looking at the asses that seem just like this , where I knew they looked like this , where I knew they had the violinists .
And I 'm driving a little robotic vehicle through the ship of ship .
When I say that , I 'm driving it , but my mind is in the vehicle .
It seemed to be physically present in the Titanic relationship .
And it was the most surround of the most surreal surreal that I 've ever lived , because you know , before I knew what would be behind , before the lights of the vehicle , because I had path the set for months to the movie .
And the set was based on a replication of the ship model of the ship .
So it was an absolutely extraordinary experience .
And it really made me realized that in the telepresence of the telepresence that you can take through these avators , the mind is injected in the vehicle , in this other form of existence .
It was very profound .
And it could be a small assembly of what could happen between a few decade when we 're going to start having the cyborg for explorations or other motivates in the human future that I can imagine , as many of the human future that I can imagine , from the advantasy .
So , we 've done these expeditions , and we really started to appreciate what there was under , as the open depth of the ocean where these animals had these animals .
Actually , I 'm right here on the earth .
They live in a chemosynthesis environment .
They don 't survive in a sunlight , how we do it .
So , you see animals that they live close to 500 degree water running .
It looks like even impossible .
At the same time , I was really interested in space , again , one time , is the influence of the phantoy , as a girl .
And I ended into the space environment , really involved with NASA , sitting into the NASA , sitting in the NASA , to plan missions , go to Russia , to go to Russia , to go to Russia , and all of these things , to fly to fly the international space station to the international spatial spatial station to the international spactical space .
It was fascinating .
But what I ended to do is to take the space scientists with us in the absis .
And then bring them down , because they could have access --
So , we were coming to the documentary , but we actually did this science , the space science .
I was closed to be a phaning between being phand phantascience , to do those things really .
And you know , I learned a lot of learned .
I learned a lot of science . But I also learned a lot of the leadership .
Everybody thinks that a regist should be a leader , the chapter of the ship , or something like that .
I didn 't know any leadership before I did all those expeditions .
Because I had to say , " What am I 'm doing here ? "
Why am I doing it ? What do I get to ? "
You don 't have anything to do all these spectacles .
At eventually , we 're not going to have it .
People think almost that I went to " Titanic " and " Hatar " and " Hatar " and " Hatar " and " Hatar " and "
I 've done all these movies , all these documentary documentary .
Nobody , no glory , no money . What am I doing ?
I 'm doing it for the task , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the biggest challenge that there is the biggest challenge that there , and for the strange of the discovery , when a small group of people form a team deployed .
Because we did everything with 10-12 people working together , working together for years .
Sometimes in the sea for 2-3 months of file .
And in the legacy , you realize that the important thing is the respect you have to , and that they have for you , when you finished a task that you can 't explain to each other .
When it comes back to the earth and explains , " We had to do this , and the optical fiber , and that , all of technology , and that , all technology , and the spread , all of technology , and the spread , and the spread of the human performance when you 're working on the sea -- you can 't explain that .
To create a bond , to create a legal respect .
When I came back to do my movie , which is " Havatar . " I tried to apply the same principle of leadership that leadership the team and changing their respect .
It 's really changed the dynamic .
And so here I 'm still in a little group , in territory inexplored to do " Havatar " with new technologies that didn 't exist before .
Terribly exciting .
By businesses .
And we 've become a family , in four and a half years .
And it completely changed my way to do movie .
People have started saying that I took the organisms from the ocean and I put them on the planet .
For me , it was the essence of how to do business , which was changed .
What can we do that ?
What are the lessons we 've learned ?
I think that the first is curiosity .
It 's the most powerful thing that we have .
The imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality .
And the respect of the group is more important than all of the world in the world .
Dams come from me , and they say , " Dams me to do this . "
And I said , " Don 't limitations .
Other people are going to do it for you , not to do it for you .
And you have risk . "
NASA always says this phrase : " The mistake is not contempt . "
But the mistakes must be an option in the art and exploration , because it 's how to do a hall .
And there 's no important attemplated that has been done without risk .
You have to be disposed to run these risks .
This is the thought I want to leave you , which is that in whatever you do , the mistake is an option , but the fear not . Thank you .
If I wanted you to understand one big idea is that we consumption is that we consumed is bigger than the sum of his parts , and that instead of thinking about the too much information , I would think of how to use information to make new new relations so to emerge new trends , otherwise .
So here you see the types of organized mortality .
This instrument that I use is a little experiment .
It 's called Pivot , and Pivot , and I can choose to filter a single cause of death , say the accidents .
And then we see emergency new relationship .
The reason is that here in the central part of the people are more active .
We can do a step back and reorganize the data because of death , we see that circulatories and cancer are the major initiated disease , but not for everybody .
If we go on , and we 're going to say , 40 , we see that the accidents are the cause of death that more .
I 'm closer to , which is especially for men .
So you 've got to visualize information and data in these way is a little bit like swimming in a degree information sea .
What if we can do that with raw data , because you don 't do that with the content ?
For instance here we have the cover of every Sports Illustrated .
All of this . Everything in the network .
You can return into your rooms and try it also .
You can look at a decade .
Or a specific year .
You can isolating a particular number .
For example , we take the athletes that appears in this number , their sports .
So , I 'm a Lance Armstrong , so I 'll see all of the numbers in which LArmstrong .
Now , if I want to give you a look at all the cycle ?
I 'm a step back back and I 'm the visual .
And now I see Greg Lemond Lemond .
You know , you know , you know , when you go between the information in this closer , or further away from going back and forth and it 's not just a research , it 's not just a browser .
But you do something slightly different .
It 's a half that we think it 's going to change how we can use information .
We 're going to be a little bit of crazy .
We took every single page of the Wikipedia page , and we reduced it up to a little synchosis that it 's a little synchosses and an icycle that 's area .
I 'll just show you the first 500 of the most visited about Wikipedia .
Even in this limited skills , we can do a lot of it .
You understand what thematic areas are the most visited on Wikipedia .
At this point selections .
We see this option , we see that the Wikipedia of Wikipedia more often associated with this voice is the " Ely-Time Magazine .
This is significant because it makes emergency something that in Wikipedia .
And you see it just a step back to see the together .
If I take one of these reports , I can then zooming on the category , " of the Magazine " of the Magazine .
and see them all .
And I see that most of the government comes from the government of the world of science . A minor number of the world of science . A minor number of business .
Here 's my head .
One comes from music .
And , rather interesting , Bono also has won a TED prize .
So we go to see all the winners of the TED prize .
For the first time , we 're really navigating in the network , as if it was a network , it doesn 't page page , but to a superior .
I want to show you another thing that could surprise .
This is the site of the New York Times .
Pivot , this application -- we don 't call it browser , because it 's not a browser , but we need to see web pages -- we add this this technology for zoom in web , like this .
I can do a step back and right back to a specific section . This is important because I just see the Web pages , so it 's going to see my navigation in the Internet in the same way .
I can zooming what I did in specific moments .
Here you see this state of the demo that I 've just presented .
I can see some other things that I 've seen in the day .
If I want to do a step back and see everything , I can do with my historical or the historical of my research .
And I was looking for newly , I was looking for the Bing motor Bing , here for Live Labs Pivot .
And from here I can zooming my Web page , and I just reflect from here .
An metaphor , a lot of times , and in every case , the result is greater than the sum of the parts , of the data .
So , in the world , the data are seen as a kind of males .
It talks about information .
It 's talking about eating in data .
And if we put all all over if we put the Web above instead of going from one thing to the other , would we get used to to get a lot of other things that we can see these structures that otherwise .
And then instead of feeling us in the data , we could really extract information .
Instead of doing information , we can pull out of the knowledge .
And by the knowledge maybe even to the wisdom .
And with this thank you .
So , these days , they all talk about happiness .
I asked to count the number of content books , the word " happiness " in the title and published in the last five years , they 're stopped to count for 40 , and there were more .
There 's a huge wave of interest in happiness , between researchers .
There 's a lot of coaching about happiness .
Everybody would want to make the happier people .
But despite all this flow of work , there are a series of " which are making a series of " that somehow make it impossible to elaborate ideas about happiness .
My talk about this today is especially about these cognitive traps .
And it turns out that they think about their happiness , and it 's about studying happiness , because we 're looking at happiness , because we are confused as all of the other people .
The first one of these traps is relaps to admit the complexity .
In fact , that the word happiness is no longer as useful as much as we applied it to too many fields .
I think that you can restringer to a particular meaning , but in the massive line of massive , but we 're going to have to deal with this acception , and we 're going to have to adow the most complicated vision of what the well-being .
The second training is the confusion between experience and memory : in practice , it 's basically to choose between being happy in life , and be happy about their own life or happy about their own life .
And these are two extremely different concept , both part of the concept of happiness .
And the third one is the illusion of the unfortunate that unfortunate is the unfortunate that we can 't think of any circumstance that affects the importance of well-being .
I mean , it 's a real cognitive truth .
and there 's no way to do the right thing .
I 'd like to start with an example of a person who , after a session of questions and answers , after one of my lesson , told a story .
[ unclear ] -- he said , while he was listening to a symphony of music , right ? ]
And then you add , in a very emotional way , which he found the entire experience .
But it was not true .
The one that was ruined was the memory of the experience .
He had the experience .
And he had heard for 20 minutes of the wonderful music .
but that doesn 't count for anything because he remained a certain remember ; he had a certain time ; the remember , and the remember was everything that they would remained .
What this episode tells us , at the bottom , is that we could think of ourselves and other people in terms of two sis .
There 's a sharing sharing experiences , which lives in the present and knows the present , and it 's able to revive the past , but that actually has the present .
It 's about " and it 's living experiences , and what the doctor is going to happen to -- you know when the doctor asks , " To you do it bad now , when you touch up here ? "
And then there 's the question that you remember , " it 's " it 's " and it reminds that you reminds the points , and it 's all about the history of our life , and is that it 's what the doctor is going to ask , " How are you heard in the last time ? "
or " How did you go to Albania ? " or something like that . "
Those are two entities , which is living one of them , and what if you remember , and to confuse between the two is part of the confusion on the notion of happiness .
And it reminds , it 's a dotaster .
And this process starts with a fundamental answer of our reminds -- starts immediately .
We not only don 't tell stories only when we decide to tell them .
Our memory tells us stories , which is that we remains of our experiences is a story .
Let me start with an example .
It 's an old study .
that brings the experiences of two patients during a painful processing .
I 'm not going to get into detail . It 's not even more painful in the day , but it was painful in the ' 90s .
And he asked the patients to report their pain every 60 seconds .
And here 's the results for two patients .
Those are their results .
If you ask , " Who 's the two have suffered ? "
It 's a very simple question .
Clearly , the Patient B has suffered more .
its bonscopy longer , and for every minute of pain suffering from the patient . At the B has suffered at least as much A or more .
But now there 's another question : How many of these patients think they have suffered ?
And here 's the surprise : Oxxiety of A reminds of a reminute of the Patient B.
The stories of copies were different given that a particularly delicated part of the procedure is the way to -- no one of these stories is particularly positive -- but one of the two is particularly positive .
And the worst is that where the pain was maxiety at the end .
It 's a negative story .
How do I know that ?
Because we asked these people after colonscopy , and even a distance of time , " How negative has been the experience , everything considered ? "
and most of the worst of A worst for B , in the remember .
So , this is a conflict conflict between the evis that lived experiences .
From the point of view of the sis that it lives , it 's clear that B has more jobs .
So , what you could do for the patient A , and we made clinical experiments , and it was really done , and it 's been done , and it 's been done , and it works , you could extening the pipppy of the Patient .
This will cause a little bit of pain in patient , but only a little bit , and much less than before .
And by doing this for a couple of minutes , the evis that lived the experience of the Patient At A 's going to be worst , and that remember the experiences of the Patient A lot better time , because now Patient remember the experience of his experience .
How do you call a story ?
And this is true for the stories that are from reminds that the stories that we inventirely what we call a story , are the changing moments and meaning .
The final is very , very important and , in this case , the final has dominated .
So , the evis that lived experiences living his life in a continues .
Is it moments when they live in experiences , and you know , what happens to these moments ?
And the answer is simple .
I 'm hoping to say that most of our life -- to say that most of our life -- to how I 've calculated the psychologist tells that it means that in a life , which means that in a life , we count about 600 million . In a month of 600 million . In a month if we 're not going to let .
Most are totally ignored by the sis that recurrent .
And yet , in some way you have the feeling that should be happy , that what happens in these moments of experience is our life .
It 's the limited resources that we 're spending while we are in this world .
And how to spend it , it would seem relevant , but it 's not the story that it reminds for us .
So we have a sharp shares , and a shares , and a sharing experiences that are quite different experiences .
The bigger difference between the two is how to treat time .
From the point of view of the sis that lives , if you go in vacity , and the second week is fun as much as the first , then the vacation of two weeks is two times better than the vacation of a week .
But this is not absolutely the way that sis that remember .
For the sis that remember , a vacity of two weeks is vacity better than one week , because there are no new reminds in addition .
You haven 't changed the story .
And in this way , the time is the critical variable that distinguishes the evis that it reminds of the sis that lived in experiences .
The time has a limited impact on this story .
Well , the eventually reminds experience experiences more than to remember and telling stories .
It 's actually what it 's going to be decisions because , if we look at a patient who 's had , for example , two copies with two different medings , and it 's deciding what the two chooses , what you 're going to choose .
The shares lives in these choices .
In fact , we don 't choose in experiences , but between the reminds of those experiences .
And even when we think about our future , we don 't think about our future as experiences .
We think of our future as memories as you know .
So you 're basically looking at this situation , as a tyrannia of sis that reminds , and you can think of the sis that reminds of the experience of which , the experiences experiences , which it doesn 't need .
I feeling that when we go in vacity , you often get to the case , you go to vacance the service of our sis that reminds .
And this is a little hard to justify .
It 's , how do we use our memories ?
This is one of the explanations that 's given for the predomination .
When I think about that , I 'm in a vacity in the Antarctica of a few years ago , which is one of the best vacity of my life , and I think relatively , respect the other vacation .
And I probably spent to think of that trip three weeks , to say , 25 minutes in the last four years .
If I had ever opened the sign with the 600 photographs of the journey , I would spent another hour . It 's about three weeks of journey that is going to translate an an hour and a half an hour . It seems that there is a talk .
Well , I could be a little extreme , in my showing appeted for the remind consumption , but even if you do more than this , a genuine question .
Why do we take a weight to the weight that we go in experiences ?
I want you to think about an experiment with thinking .
Imagine that during the next vacces , you know , at the end of the vacity of all the photographs will be destroyed , and you take a medicine medicine for amnesia , so you don 't remember anything .
Are you going to choose the same vacity ? And if you could choose a different vacity , you create a conflict between two sis , and you 've got to think of how you do that , and you have to think of how long time you have an answer .
And if you think in terms of remember , you could get another answer .
The because we choose the vacces we do , is a problem that we 're doing , is a problem that we 're going to put in front of the two sis .
The two sweet notions of happy .
There are actually two happy concepts of happiness that we can use , one for each sis .
So you can ask , how happy is that it makes the experience ?
And then you can wonder : How happy are the moments in sis that living experiences ?
And it 's about -- happiness for moments , it 's a complicated process .
What are the emotions that we can measure ?
And , by the way , we 're able to make a good idea of the happiness of sis that living experiences in time .
If you tomorrow happiness , it 's a completely different thing .
It 's not how happy a person alive .
It 's about how sophister and it 's the person when you think about his life .
It 's a very different idea .
Anybody is not able to distinguish these two notions , it 's not going to be able to create confusion in happiness , and I look at a bunch of students of well-being , and I 'm going to look at a long time .
The difference between the happiness of sis that lived experiences and satisfaction that has been recognized in the last few years , and there are now some of the efforts to measureing two separately , the Gallup institute where more than half a million people have been supposed to be supposed to one issues on what they think of their life and their experiences .
And there were other studies in this direction .
So in the last few years , we started to learn about happiness .
And the biggest lesson that we 've learned , is that they 're very different .
You might know how much a person is satisfied with your life , and yet this doesn 't tell you a lot about how happy they 're living your own life and vast .
to give you an idea of correlation , the correlation is about 0.5 .
Which means that if you measte somebody , and they said , " Oh , her father is 1,80 m " how would you know about his height ?
Well , you would know something about its height , but with a lot of uncertainty .
You would always have a bit of uncertainty .
If I tell you that somebody thinks his life is at eight in a scale from one to 10 , you 're going to be very incerts about how happy they are with their own .
So correlation is is low .
We have a certain knowledge of the satisfaction of sis happy .
We know that money is very important , the goals are very important .
We know that being happy means to be happy to be done with the people who love us , to spend of time with people who love us .
And there are other pleasure , but these are the major .
So if you want to massive happiness of the two sis , you 're going to end a lot of different things .
The conclusion of what I said is we shouldn 't think about happiness as a substitute of well-being .
It 's about two completely different ideas .
At more , very quickly , another reason that we can 't think in linear to happiness is that we don 't care about the same things when we think about life , and when we think about life .
So , if you do the simple question of how happy it is to California , you can 't get the right response .
When you ask this question , you think you should be more happy in California , which is in Ohio .
What happens is that when you think about California , you 're thinking about the contrast between California and other places , and for that compared to the climate .
Well , the climate is not that climate is not as important for shares , and it 's not really important for the sis , and it 's not really important for the sis that that it 's what you decide how happy are the people .
But because it turns out it 's in charges , you could end , you might end up -- some people might , at the end , transfer to California .
And it 's interesting to verifying what 's going to happen to people in California hope to be more happy .
Well , the sis that living experiences is not going to be happy .
We know it .
But what 's going to happen . They think they 're more happy , because when they think they 're thinking about , they will remember how terrible it was the time in Ohio .
And they 're going to think that the right decision .
It 's very difficult to think of well-being , and I think I gave you the idea of how hard it is .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you . I have a question for you .
Thank you very much .
When we were at the telephone a couple of weeks ago , he mentioned me that an interesting result of the Gallup .
Is it something that you think we 're going to share that we still have a few minute ?
Daniel Kahneman : Yeah .
I think the most interesting result , I think we 've found in the Gallup is a number , that we didn 't expect to find .
We found that , with reference reference to the sis that lives experiences .
When we looked at this as the feelings variass with the income , we 've discovered that , at the underneath of a 60,000 dollars a year , for Americans , on one a very vast samplaged on a very vast sampion for about 600,000 dollars a year -- it 's a full of a representative sample , at the underunderneath of a 600,000 dollars a year --
CA : 600,000 DK : 600,000 dollars a year , people are unhappy , and they become progressively more unhappy , and they become progressively more unhappy as they become a poor , at the top line .
I mean , I 've seen a rarely of lines .
Clearly , what happens is that money doesn 't buy the happiness of the experience , but the lack of money , misery mies , and we can measuring that misery , and we can measure that seriously .
In terms of the other sis , it reminds , it 's all the different story .
The more content six .
This is not giving an emotions .
CA : But Danny , all the effort of American effort .
If you take people seriously this discovered , in practice , it practice , for instance , the politics on the taxes and so on .
Is the ability that politicians , and the nation in general , can we take a discover as seriously and bring a public politician based on it ?
DK : You know I think I recognize the role of happiness in public politics .
The pressure of consideration will be slow in the United States , there is no doubt , but in the U.K. , is becoming reality , and in other states .
People are starting to recognize that they should think about happiness when they think about public politics .
You 're going to put a little bit and people start to talk about if they want to study the experience of happiness or if they want to study the valuutation of life that we need to begin this debate to the most soon .
As the happy thing , as you think about how you think , and it takes different directions to how you think , and depending on it , and then you think of the evening of it .
This is going to influence the politics , I think , in the years that will be .
In the United States , you 're doing the effort to measure the experience of the population .
And that , I think , it 's going to be part of the next decade , maybe two , of the national statistics .
CA : Well , it seems to me that this argument is going to be , or at least it should be , the discussion of the most interesting politics to follow in the next years .
Thank you very much for invented behavioral economy .
Thank you Danny Kahneman .
I 'm going to talk about energy and climate .
It may seem strange , because in my work on the foundation of lower vaccines and seeds , things to invent , and things to help the two billion poorer people to live better lives .
But climate and energy , in fact , they 're extremely important for these people , in fact , they 're most important for everyone else in the world .
A worst climate means , for many years , loss of crops .
It 's going to have any rain , or too long .
The things will change in ways that their fragile environment just cannot support .
Which brings to hunger . It 's uncertainty .
So , climate campes ,
Even the cost of energy is , for them , important .
In fact , if you could lose the price of one thing , to reduce the poverty , you would choose longer the energy .
The price of energy is down in time .
And a progret civilization of progress in energy .
The coal revolution has powered that industrial .
And even in the 20th century , we 've seen a quick decline in the price of electricity , that explains why we have the refrigerators , we can create modern materials and do so many things .
So , in the rich world , we 're as as for electricity in a excellent situation .
But while the price goes down , for example of the half , we have to respect a new vine , the vincular of CO2 emissions .
CO2 is climbing the planet , and his equation is very simple .
CO2 emitted to be a temperature , which is very negative effects .
So , at the climate and , maybe even worse , indirect effectively , in the sense that the natural ecosystems can 't go to these rapid changes , and they collapse .
The valuutation of how much increasing temperature because of a CO2 , and as each one of the worst things the other , and it 's uncertainly , but not very much .
And there 's certainly uncertainty about how negative effect , but they 're going to be extremely negatives .
At that , I often asked the best scientists . We have to really reduce emissions almost zero ?
Don 't we just not only half or half a quarter ?
And the answer is that , as long as we 're not going to go to zero , the temperature will continue to wait up .
So it 's a great challenge , so .
It 's not how to say , " We 're going to spend a tall , 3.5 , under a bridge . "
It 's not a little bit . "
It 's about to get to zero .
Now , we made a lot of CO2 every year , over 26 billion tons .
About 20 tons for every Americans .
For the points of the poor countries , it 's less than one tons .
The world 's media is about five tons .
And somehow , we have to make progress that we have to take that amount of zero .
The emissions are constantly increased .
Only some economic changes have changed this tendency , so we have to go from increasing to the decrease to zero .
This equation has four factors .
It 's a series of multipplications .
We 've got the amount on the left , the CO2 , which has to be blue , and the farmers on the right is the population , the services in average person uses , the average energy request by a service and CO2 emit for uniquely and CO2 emit for uniquely of energy .
Let 's go to each factor , and we see how we can use it .
Probably , one of these numbers must lower fin almost zero .
It 's algebra .
We see a little bit .
The first factor is population .
The world has 6.8 billion people today .
We become towards nine billion .
If we do a good job with the new vaccines , health reproductive health , we can decrease , we can decrease from the 10 , 15 percent , but here we 're going to use a 30 percent increase .
The second factor is the services that we use .
which makes everything , the food that we eat , the vestiary , TV , the warming .
They 're awful things , and freeze poverty means to provide these services for almost all the world .
And this is a good thing that this number .
In the rich world , in the richer world , we probably could save and use less , but in average , every year , this number is going to go .
And therefore , complex , the amount of services for herogen will be more than double .
This is a very simple example of service .
You 've got the illumination in your house , to do their homework , but these guys not , so they go and read their homework below the lamples .
The efficiency efficiency -- and , the energy for units of service -- I finally have a good news .
This factor is not increasing .
Thank you very much of the inventions , new ways of illuminating , we 've done differently , constructionally , for a lot of services you can decrease the consumed energy .
In some services you can reduce 90 percent .
There are other services , like fertilizers , or the transport airplane , where the aircraft margins are very , very intimers .
So , complex , consumption , energy consumption is going to be three to maybe six times .
But these first three factors reduce emissions from 26 to , in the best cases , maybe 13 billion tons .
It 's not enough .
Let 's look at the quarter factor , the key factor , the amount of CO2 emitted to units of energy .
The question is , can we bring it to zero ?
If you burn a coal , no .
If you burn natural gas , no .
Almost all the ways to produce the electricity , part of the renewable and nuclear , including CO2 .
So , what we have to do on global scale , so , it 's to create a new system .
And we need to miracles .
And I think of miracle , I don 't mean something impossible .
The microprocessor is a miracle . The computer is a miracle .
The Internet , and its services are a miracle .
People here are participated to creation of a lot of miracles .
We usually don 't have a scady , a given enter whose miracle .
It 's usually , you 're going to the window , something else is not .
In this case , we have to drive at all speed , and make a miracle in the very restretched templates .
I asked , how to illustrate this concept ?
Is there any natural example , a few demonstration that capture the imagination of people ?
I thought about a year ago , when I took mosquitoes , and people found it fun .
I made them particians that , in the world , there are people living with mosquitoes .
This is my idea for energy .
I decided that to fly baby would have this year my contribution to the environment .
Here 's the labs .
They tell me that they 're not going to get out of the boattle .
now , we can invent tricks like this , but they 're not going to be help .
We need a lot of solutions , or so many of them are , which work on big scale and very reliable , and although you 're exploring in many directions , I think that only five could be a very important effect .
I have the marches , the nuclear fusion , nuclear fusion , nuclear fusion , nuclear fuels .
They can also give a few contribute , and if they can do more than I expect , but here I 'm interested in here , but here I 'm interested in that we 're going to work on top of these five , and not to give up one , because all brilliant challenges them .
We start for the first fossil fuel combustion of fossil fuel , carbon or natural gas that is .
Here 's our task seems , but it 's not , and it 's caught to CO2 , after combustion , at the combustion , pressurate it , put it out somewhere , and hoping that there .
Now , there are experimental technologies that capture 60 -- 80 percent CO2 , but reaching 100 percent of CO2 , but reaching 100 percent is going to be very difficult and it 's going to be difficult and it 's going to be very difficult , and you know .
The most amazing issues is still the longer term .
Who 's going to trust ?
Who will you have something that is literally billions of times more voluminous than any kind of imaginable to nuclear or something ?
It 's a huge volume .
So it 's a difficult problem .
Another function would be nuclear .
But the nuclear presents three big problems .
The cost , especially rulated countries , it 's high .
The issue of security , the feeling to feel sure that nothing can go wrong , because of human operators , and that combustified by human operators , and that combustible is not being used at the bellic .
And how do you run the scream ?
Mave the amount of reducation , the concerns are so many .
People need to be insurance .
So , you know , so you could solve , and that you could solve , and what you should work .
The last three of five sources , I rupted them .
They 're the ones that often defines " renewables . "
And to say the real , although the great advantage of not require a combustible , they present some of the disadvantages .
The first is that the density of energy produced with these technologies is really inferior to that of an electric central .
It 's about " collecting energy , and so a lot of square kilometers , of areas of a normal electronic central power .
Also , these sources are intermitter .
The sun doesn 't splenses everything day , or every day , and even the wind always suffering .
So if you depends on these sources , you have to find a way of herogether , even when the source doesn 't make it .
It was challenges us in the costs of the costs .
And the distribution .
For example , let 's say that this energy source is in the summer .
So , not only you need technology , but you also have to do the rest with the risks of the summer .
And finally , the problem of accumulate .
To stimate the size of the problem , I looked at all kinds of bacteria do today , for cars , computers , telephones , whatever , I confronted them with the amount of electrical energy used in the world , and I 've discovered that all the bacteria now in the world and discovered that all the bacteria now in the world and discovered that all of 10 minutes of all that energy .
So we really need a big step forward , a improvement of 100 times respect to the approaches now in use .
which is not impossible , but it 's not very simple .
This problem is manifest when you intermittents , you know , 20 or 30 percent of the consumed energy .
If you have to those sources for 100 percent , you need a miraculous bacteria .
What 's the right approach ? What 's the right approach ?
Is it a Manhattan Project ? What could we solve the problem ?
A lot of companies , to hundreds , they have to work .
We need at least hundred people in each one of these five sectors .
Many of them , you know , you would call them . It 's a good thing .
And I think here , in the TED group , many people are already working on these camps .
Bill Gross has different companies , including a lot of great technologies in termic solar term .
Vinod Khosla is is investing in dozens of companies that are doing big things , and they have interesting potential things , and they have interesting potential things .
Nathan Myhrvold and I 're financing a company that , will surprise you , follow the nuclear road .
There are a few innovations in the ran , nuclear modulating nuclear , liquid .
But from a long time , the sector is that there are some good ideas around , that there are some good ideas around it 's not really surprising .
The idea of Terrapower is that , instead of bringing only part of the uranium , the U235 , one percent of the huranium uranium , we decided to burn the U238 , the 99 percent is a crazy idea , in one sense .
For the truth to talk for a long time , but it has never been adequately tried whether it would work or not , so thank you very much of the supercomputer modern supercomputers today can do a simulation and see yes , with the right materials seem to work .
And because you 're burning 99 percent of the uranium , the structure of the cost to drastically .
They 're burning the shapes , and they use as combustible as well as well as well as well as well as well as well as , from the problem that were , a resource to exploit .
It 's consumption as combustion . It 's kind of a candle .
It 's kind of like a little wood that argue . Space is called reactor reactor reactor .
From the point of the combustible the problem is solved .
Here 's a picture of a place in Kentucky .
This is shot , 99 percent of the uranium , which has been tolled to the part of this as a combustible , and so this is called uranium uranium .
These downs would the United States for centuries .
And by filling the sea water , with an economic process , there would be enough to the rest of this planet .
So , a lot of challenges attended us , but this is one example of the hundreds of hundreds of ideas of hundreds of ideas that we need to do it .
How should we measure our progress ?
What would they have to count the pages ?
We Identify the goal , and then we use the intermedical steps .
You 've heard a lot of people talking about an 80 percent reduction for the 2050 , it 's really important to do it .
20 percent will be produced by the poor countries , and from a little bit of agriculture .
At that point , hopefully , we 'll have deforestation and the production of cement .
So to go to 80 percent , so , the countries developed countries , including nations like China , will have to replace completely their electric production .
The other question is , are we doing this technology to zero emissions ?
Are we doing this in practice in countries ,
Are we going to spread the allows ?
It 's a very important aspect .
It 's a key element of the page .
Are you going to have the 2020 ?
The one should have the same two aspects .
We should be implementation of efficiency to begin to get the reductions .
We 're going to be the minor amount of CO2 , and so temperature .
But the vote in this matter , to do things that don 't beat great reductions , has a weight only , or even the other , which is the speed of the innovation of new inventions .
We have to push these progress , and we can measure the speed , and we can measure the speed from the number of companies ,
Many good books have been written about it .
The Al Gore 's book , " The Gore choice , " and that of David McKay , " Sustainable Energy Without the Hot Air . "
These books approach the problem , and they create a context in which they want to debate the debate because these things need a spread .
Many things have to come up with contemporary .
So I 've got a wish ,
A very concrete wish that we 're going to invent technology .
If I had to choose one wish for the next 50 years , you can choose the president of the country , the realization of a vaccine , which I 'm going to take a vaccine , which is going to be able to do this thing that costs half and it doesn 't CO2 , choose this last .
It would be the biggest impact .
If this wish is not going to do , the fractance between the United States and the long term , between the United States and China , between the United States and China , between rich countries and rich , and especially , life of those two billion people will be long worst .
So , what do we have to do ?
What am I going to you to take the initiative and processing ?
It 's needed a bigger to research .
When the countries came together as Copenhagen , they shouldn 't just talk about CO2 .
They have to discuss also the innovation program , and you would stupiect you would also be invested in these innovative processes .
We need incentives , taxes on CO2 , the " cap and trade , instruments that you 're going to take the cost of the pollution .
We have to spread the message .
We have to make this more rational dialogue , and it has to include the government choices to include the government choices .
It 's a busy wish , but I believe it .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
Thank you . Just to know more about Terrapower , this is --
first of all , you can give us a idea of the investment dimension ?
Bill Gates : Realize the software , buying the supercomputer , assume all of the great scientists , what we 've done , required only tens of millions , and even when we 're going to have been tested , and even when we 're going to talk about hundreds of millions .
The difficult thing is to build the pilot , to find various billions , authority , which is going to build the first examples .
Once the first one , if it works as announced , it 's going to be Cologist , because the costs , the density of energy , are completely different from nuclear that we know today .
CA : So , if I understand , you know , this employed the construction , well-underground , of a vertical combustible nuclear combustible , of this kind of wildlife .
And then the process starts from the top , and the bottom ?
BG : Right , right . The reactors , are refornites continually , a lot of people , many control that can 't work , open continue , things that come in and out --
It 's not good !
If the combustible is very cheap , and you can do that for 60 years , put it in and forgotten and forgotten all of the complexity .
Keep there , burn for a sex-year-old , and then finished .
CA : A nuclear plant to talk about itself .
BG : Yeah . Well , you can leave them there , then you can leave them in another reactor and burn them .
And we 're going to start with the rejournals , now conserved in vases of cooling or to content .
They 're going to be our first combustible .
So what was a problem of conventional reactors will be the fuel , and the volume of the refuel is going to be very impressive , as soon as this process is going to be .
CA : But when you talk around the world of the potential of this technology , where most interest in the world of this technology , where you 've been doing ?
BG : Well , there 's no place in particular , and there are all these interesting rules of transparency about everything that 's called nuclear , so we 're going to take a lot of interest .
Our staff was in Russia , India , China .
I just met the Seretary for Energy .
We talked about how this idea is trained to the curriculum .
I 'm optimistic . French and Japanese have done in this field .
It 's a variation on something that has been done .
This is a substantial improvement , but it 's a quick reactor , which many countries have already built , so everybody has built , so everybody has built a fast reactor 's a good candidate to actor your own .
CA : Does you , what are the temples and the probability that kind of thing ?
BG : Well , for one of these projects , which produces energy , which produces energy , which is not so much , we talk about 20 years to design it and 20 to build it .
This is the scady that the environmental models demonstrate .
So , you know , you know , you know , it 's not a little bit , it could easily satisfied this goal .
And now there are , lucky , luckily , dozens of companies in the industry , if their research works , if they 're financially going to be able .
And it 's better if a lot of solutions will be successful , because at that point you can remember a set of solutions .
It needs that at least has a success .
CA : To you talk about important , revolutionaries , this is the biggest that you know ?
BG : A energy revolution is the most important thing .
It would be even been without the environmental vincles , but the environmental vincles make it much more important .
In the rate of nuclear , there are other innovators .
We don 't know their work as well as this , but one is the nuclear " , " a different approach . "
There 's a liquid reactor . It seems hard to do , but maybe they say the same thing of us .
So , there are different , therefore , but the beauty is that a sprigion a million times more energy than a molecule , say , carbon molecule , say , carbon , so , if you can manage the negatives , potential in terms of effectively , in terms of effectively , in terms of the environment and other , it 's almost a class .
CA : And if it doesn 't work , what do we do ?
Wouldn 't we be able to start adopting measured to try to keep the terrestrial temperature ?
BG : If you 're in that situation , it 's a little bit like when you eat too , and you 're going to have a cardiac attack .
Where go to that point ? Could you need a surgeon or something like that .
There 's a whole line of research on the so-called geo-engineering , which is various techniques that are slowed techniques , which is slowing down the climb .
It 's as an insurance a policy .
You 're not going to have it .
Some people say that you shouldn 't even work at the policy because you might be you , to keep eating you , to keep eat because so much the surgeon will salt you .
I don 't think it 's a wise choice , you know , the importance of the problem , but now in the geo-engineering 's asking , if you need to hold solutions in the case that the events are precipitating , or innovations coming to the predict .
CA : Clima-skeptics : if I had a phrase or two of them , how would you persuade them ?
BG : Well , unfortunately , there are different kinds of skeptics , and those of scientific arguments are very few .
Some people say that there is a negative feedback to the clouds that are dealing the warming effects of the warming effects .
They 're very , very few things that you can only tell you that there is a chance of a million that you have a chance in the main problem that looks like AIDS .
You can put a mistake up , and you pay the consequences just a lot of later .
And so , when you 're in a thousand emergency , the idea of sacrifice that you see the results only after --
sacrifice for you not well notes .
In fact , the IPPPPPPPPPPPPPPPC and says , there 's people in the rich that you look at IPPC and says , OK , it 's not bad .
The fact is that incertainty should push us to action .
But my dream is that , if we can do it cheap , and to respect the vincles on CO2 , then they 're going to say , OK , I don 't care if you don 't emits CO2 , almost prefer I would say that it because it 's cheap it because it 's cheap technologies .
CA : Do you have this response to Bjorn Lomborg 's reasoning , that if you invest all your own own energy trying to solve the CO2 problem , your goals are going to be sacrified . And that we 're going to put a money , when there 's better things to do , it means to spend resource resources ?
BG : Well , there 's effective spending and development --
we say that the U.S.A should spend 10 billion more than they do now , it 's not so ingent .
It shouldn 't be able to distract resources to others .
The things that are going to do a lot of money , and there are some reasonable of people , are the financial solutions .
For me , it 's especially .
At least that you 're not going to funding the learning curve , getting close to the point where it 's going to be very economic , I think that the vading effort .
If the alternative was , let 's make it cost , so that only the rich can afford to be able to afford , all of the rich can afford to pay the energy five times as much without changing life .
The disaster would be for those two billion .
And also Lomborg saw his positions .
Her argument is , " Why don 't you 're not going to talk more than Ricerca and Swuper ? "
And it 's going to hit up between the " skeptics , but he understood that it 's a tremendous group , and therefore it 's lifetime .
And it 's a question that I think is appropriate .
It 's unbelievable how a search for development .
CA : Well , I think I 'm going to talk to the name of the audience , saying that I hope to see your wish . Thank you .
BG : Thank you .
I want to share with you a discover that I 've done a few months ago , as I was writing an article for the Wired Italian article .
I 've always been my dictionary of the synthy to hand every time I write something , but I had already finished to correct the article and I realized that I 'd never in my life .
Let me read you the result .
" Seney , " aggecent : dammed , Infeso , unuseful , unuseful , unuseful , stopped , stopped , stopped , leave , consumed , impowerful , multiped , impotent , unusued , Seney , decreployed , Seney , decreployed , stopping out of cut , cut off , swebed , swebed ,
Contrary : In form , strongly .
I was reading this list high list in a friend , and at the beginning , it was so ridiculed , but , I just read my voice , and I had to stop my voice , and I had to stop to take off the shock of these words have left me .
You know , we 're talking about my old dictionary dictionary ,
I 'm thinking , it 's going to be an old buildings , right .
But , of course , the earlier was of the early 80s .
when I was starting the elementary schools , and I was forming what I was out of my family and on things that was out of my family and things around me .
and , unuseful to tell it , thank God I was not using the dictionary to that time .
I mean , from this explanation , it seems like I was born in a world that see someone like me as a one that has no positive in any way for them , when I did today , I 'm celebrated for opportunities and adventure that my life has processed .
So , I 'm immediately immediately gone to see the 2009 , waiting me to find a without value .
This is the version of the description .
Unfortunately , it 's not much better .
I find the last two words underneararly contrary , " particularly discomode , " and " healthy " . " So , it 's not just looking at the words .
that 's what we believe people when we noticed them with these words .
It 's about the values behind these words , and how we build these values .
Our language flu our thinking and our thinking about the world and how we see other people .
In fact , many antic civilization , including that Greek and that Romana , believed that it was more powerful , because they would say the things at higher , because they would bring them to existence .
So , what do we want to bring a person that is limited , or a person that 's limited , or one person with greater force ?
So , you 're doing something simple like to notice as a person , a child , we could put them on the taps and throw shadows on their strength .
Don 't we want to open for them ?
A person so , who opened me the door , was the doctor of what I was girl to the Dupont in Wilt , Dupont in Wilt , Dupont .
His name is Dr. Pizzuseful .
Italopian , which name appears , it was too difficult to ready for most Americans , so it was become doctor Pr.
And the Dr. OP was wearing , and he had a perfect inclination to work with children .
I was basically anything in the hospital that I spent in the hospital , with the exception of the sessions of physiotherapy .
I had to do what they seemed to do what seemed to exercise with these big fases , in different colors , you know , to help me build a legs .
And I hated these elastics more than anything .
I hated them , really hated them , really hated them .
And , you know , I had already treated , like one of five years , with Droctor to try to exercise from these exercise , Inutilly , clear .
And one day , he came to one of my seats and inexorables , these seats .
And he said , " wow , wow , Aimee , you 're a strong girl , I think that you 're going to break up one of those baby .
" When you break it , I 'll give you 100 dollars . "
Now , of course , it was just a little handle that I didn 't want to do the exercise that I didn 't want to do with the perspective to be the richer than the second plan , but , what he did , it was to make an alien shape a different kind of an alic shape .
and turn it into an interesting experience for me .
And with me today , the entity of his vision , and his dechiaring about me as a loud , and he redefined my vision of myself in a strongly strongly and athletic person to the future .
This is an example of how adults with positions of power can inflamp the force of a child .
But , in the example of the vocabulous definitions of the syntholic definitions , our language is not a chance to evolve to the reality that we all want , the possibility of an individual to see itself itself as you .
Our language , it 's not the step to the changes of our society , many of which have been created by technology .
certainly , a medical point of view , my legs , my leams , the operations of the laser for view , ginches of titanium and even reckable bodies that are helping the people to cooperate with their skills , and move the skills of the skills that nature has imposed , without multiple .
So , maybe technology is going to be revealing us , which is always been a truth , that each has something rare and a truth to our society , and the human ability to adapt is our bigger quality .
The human ability to adapt , is something interesting , because people have always wanted to talk to me about difficulty insornmontability , and I have to tell you that .
This phrase , I 've never gone well , and I always felt that I 've always feeling to respond to people with this , and I think I 'm starting to understand why .
It 's subsign in this phrase , unsormontability , is the idea that success , or happiness , is reemergency , is reemerge on the other side of a challenge without damage or sign of this experience , if my life has come from a ability is to slavor the pressure of a life with the insic of a life with the insic of a life with a protitude .
But in fact , we 've changed , we 've changed , logically , by a challenge , or mentally both .
And I would suggest that it 's a good thing .
At the deversity is not an obstacle that we have to move our life .
It 's part of our life .
And I tend to think that 's like my shadow .
So , sometimes you noticed that , and sometimes almost nothing , but it 's always with me .
And , certainly , he wasn 't trying to decrease the impact , the weight of a person .
There are deployed and the challenges in life , and it 's all true and relative to every single person , but the question is not if you have available , but as you 're going to go through .
So , our responsibility is not simply to protect people to us from the avversity , but to get them to get them in the right way .
And we do a damage to our children when we do them feel that they 're not ready to adapt .
There 's a important difference and distinction between the medical fact of being an objective person , and the subjective opinion society that I see me or not .
And , in truth , the only disability I had to deal with is if the world has ever thought that I could be described by those words .
In our wishing desire to protect those that we love to damage a cold , truth of their medical protitude , or , really , really , the pronose of their life , we have to be sure that we 're not going to put the first morning in a wall that is going to be probably not to put the first morning .
Maybe the model of just looking at what 's broken up in you and how to put it , it can indebulate more than the subject that disease itself .
In not to deal with one person in the birthday , not to understand his potential , we 're creating another disease to add to the natural suffering that they already have .
We 're actually giving a vote to the value of a person in our community .
So we have to see through the illness of human capacity .
and more important , there 's a lot more important , there 's a relationship between suffering and our great creativity .
So , it 's not about use , or negaring , or negare , these numerous research as something that we want to avoid or to discover underneath the carpet , but rather to find those opportunity account with an accident .
So , perhaps the idea that I want to explain is that there 's not what as to overcome an avily to be able to do it , to take it , to use a term of it , to use a fight , perhaps even dancing us together .
And , maybe , if we look at an accident as a natural thing and useful , we 're fewer behind his presence .
This year , we 'll be a birthday of Charles Darwin , and it was 150 years ago , when you writing the evolution , which Darwin has illustrated , I think , the truth to the human character .
To tell you in another way , it 's not the stronger than the miles that survive , and it 's not even the smarter , is the more smart , is the most smart of the changes .
conflict is the genesis of cration .
From Darwin 's work , between other things , we can recognize that the human ability to survive and development is driven by the suffering of human spirit through conflict into transformation .
So , again , training , it 's our bigger quality .
And perhaps , we don 't know what we are .
Maybe this is what gives us the avversity , a sense of its force , a sense of its force .
So , we can do a gift .
we can imagine , re-imagine the avigation as something more difficult period .
Maybe we can see it as a change .
We 've got a change to which we 're not adapted to .
I think the biggest adversity that we 've created is this idea of normality . Now , who is normal ?
There 's no normal there . There 's no normal , there 's a typical . There 's no normal .
And would you want to meet those poor people if they exist ?
I mean , I don 't think of it .
If we change this paradigm from one of how to get the normality to one on the chance , or potential to be achieving a little bit more dangerous , we can understand the force of so many children , and inviting them to join their pretious capacity with the community .
The anthropologists teaches us that what we , as humans , we 've always wanted to the membres of our community is to be to help .
There 's an evidence that in the Olanda , 60 thousand years ago , bringing the old and the subjects , and the subjects with severe ferite , and perhaps thank you for the experience and survival .
A few years ago , I was in a market of the citizens where I grew up in that red zone in the northest Pennsylvania .
and I was implemented with a pomodors .
It was summer and I had a little bit of the corts .
I felt this guy , her voice behind me said , " but , it 's not Aimee Mullins . " And I wanted to me , and there 's this man . I didn 't have any idea what it was .
And I said , " Loook , I 'm not going to remember this ? Don 't remember I 've ever met that he said , " But , I don 't remember you to have to met me .
I mean , when we met with you , I was going to hide out of your mother . "
Oh , you know , that guy .
And but certainly , in fact , I was supposed to a camel .
That gentleman was the Dr. Kean , a man that I had only known stories from my mother on that day , because , clearly , I came to go to two weeks .
And therefore , my mother was gone to the vacity of my mother was gone to vacity , so the man who brought me was a complete exranean for my parents .
And , because I was born without the loone , and I had my feet in this foot , and some of the fingers in this foot , and some of that , he had to be the messager , this exrange had to deliver the bad news .
And he said , " I had to give this provid to your parents that you wouldn 't walk , and that you wouldn 't have the kind of mobility that have the kind of mobility that they have other children or no independent life independent , and you gave me the good thing that said to me , " you know , " Applausi . The extraordinary thing is that he told me that I had gotten artiles in all of my own school ,
I husbrought the Girl Scout , you know , the Halloween Scout , which I had won my basic bag , or all my winning winning , and I used them , enterprise them , and entertaining them , teaching the students of his medicine school in Hershey drug and Hershey .
And he called this part of the course , the X factor , the human will be .
No designed a pronose of how much podery can be and how it is determining in the quality of one person 's life .
And the DrKean continued to explain and he said , " In my experience , unless you come back , and even though it 's a bad support , and even though it 's a bad support , if it 's leaving the same , a child coming up . "
So you see , Dr. Kean has changed his opinion .
He understood that there is a difference between a medical condition and what each one can do with it .
And there was a change in my thinking during the years in this , if you 'd asked me when I was 15 years old , if I had exchanged prosthetic with the legs and bones I wouldn 't do a second .
I had that kind of normality at that time .
If you ask me , I 'm not sure , I 'm not sure .
And it 's because of the experiences I had with them , not for those experiences I had to them .
and , perhaps , change in me , because I 've been exposed to people who opened me the door to the door of what they hurt me .
You see , everything you need is a person that you need is a person who show you the epiphany of your potentially potentially , and you go . If you can give someone a kid in their force , the human spirit is so rich , if you can do it and open a door for someone in the best ways .
You 're teaching them to open the doors .
in fact , the meaning of the word of education comes from the root , which means , to pull out what it is inside , to bring the potential for the potential .
So again , what 's the potential is we want to pull out ?
There was a case in the 1960s in the Grand shirt , when they were spent by the middle schools .
It 's called the " proof it . " We call it " training " here in the United States . "
It means to separate students dependently on their voice .
And the students with the best voices have a hardest program , and better teachers , etc teachers , they did it for a period of three months , At students with indicated , they said , they were good .
And at the end of this period of three months , they were having the results at the end of " opinion . " And , clearly , the sad of this study , and they took some of this study , and they said , " It 's what happened to the end of the three months .
The ones that were in school , beyond to the ones I left .
And the crucial part of this study was that even the teachers had been reverted .
The teachers didn 't know that was done this change .
And he simply said , these are the good students , and these are the people with indeed .
And that 's how they began to teach him .
So , I think the real disability is to have a damaged spirit , and a spirit damaged , and a damaged damn 't hope .
It doesn 't see the beauty .
It has no longer our natural , infant curiosity and our indeed capacity to imagine .
if instead , we can support the human spirit to keep the hope , to see beauty in yourself and in others , to be imaginative and curious , hallers that we 're using our strength force .
When spirit has these quality quality , we can create new reality and new ways of being .
I 'd like to leave you with a poetry , because of a poem of 130-called Hafiz who made me know my friend Jacques Dembois .
and the poetry is called " The balling only four words . "
Thank you .
