Park years ago , at TED , Peter Skillman introduced a design challenge called the marshmallow .
And the idea is very simple .
Suppods of four people have to build the highest possible possible that you can be remaining alone , using 20 spaghetti , a nastry tape , and a marshmallow meter .
The marshmallow must be piazed in the top of the tower .
And , even though it looks very simple , it 's pretty difficult , because it costring people to collaborate very quickly .
So I thought it was an interesting idea , and I encouraged it in a lab on design .
And it was a huge success .
And since then , I organized about 70 labs labs of design this guy around the world with students , designers and architects , even architects , because of the Fortune 50 .
There 's something in this exercise that revealing about the nature of collaboration , and I 'd like to share some of these lessons with you .
Normally , most people start with the orienting towards the task .
And they 're talking , you can imagine that they might have , compete for the power , then they 're going to the power , and they 're going to organizing .
They make the sketches and practice the spaces .
They have a lot of time to get more than assembling the spaghetti in structures and , eventually , when the time is going to go down , somebody out the marshmallow , and cause , somebody out the marshmallow , and causes it 's going to the top , they 're doing a step back and Ta-and .
They love the work .
But what happens is really , most of the times , is that the " Ta-to " you transform into a " Uh-oh , because the weight of the marshmallow weight .
There 's a number of people who have a lot more people who have more " uh-oh others , and among the worst of business .
At , they distracting , they distracts , and they create structures absolutely trabelant .
And there are naturally groups that have a lot of more structures , and , among the best , there are the neodiplomed of childhood .
And it 's incredible .
As Peter says Peter , not only create the higher structures , but it 's also the most interesting structures .
And your question is going to be : How is it possible ? Why have a particular thing ?
And Peter love to say , " Nobody of the kids spent time trying to become the director of SpA . "
They don 't spend time compete for the power .
But there 's another reason .
And the reason is that the economics students are formed to find a single better project .
And then I 'm going to get it .
And after , what happens is that when they put the marshmallow in the top , they don 't have any time , and what happens ?
The crisis .
Do it sounds familiar ? Right .
What the kids do different , is that they 're starting from marshmallow , and they build prototypes , one after the other , keeping the marshmallow , they have so different possibilities to address , so different possibilities of trusting around the walk .
The designers recognize that this kind of collaboration is the essence of iterative process .
And with every version , kids have a feedback to what works and what doesn 't work .
So the ability to work on prototypes is essential , but we see how different groups groups .
The average for most people is about 50 centrieters , for the economy , about half of economy , about half , lawyer , a little bit better , but not a lot of adults .
Who 's better than everybody ?
Architects and engineers , thank you .
99 percent is the highest structure that I 've ever seen .
And why ? Because they understand that triangles and the geometrics and the geometrics are the key to build stable structures .
Then we have the general directors , a little bit better than media .
But that 's where it gets interesting .
If you include a administrator of it , the group can do much better .
It 's amazing . It goes around , you know , " Vedrai that group is going to won . " You can see it in ancient . "
Because they have particularly skillabor .
They get the process , they understand it .
And all the kinds of groups , and all the running attention to the work better will be meaning the result of the team .
You special and agevolation , and their combination , and their combination will be successful .
If you have 10 groups that usually work well , you 'll have six that they 're going to get structures that are in the feet .
And I tried a interesting experiment .
I thought , let 's look at the time .
I put on the 10,000 dollars in the software to the software at the team .
What do you think it happened to design students ?
What was the result ?
Here 's what happened .
No one of the team created structure .
If one of them had built a 2.5 miles , it would take the home .
Isn 't it 's interesting that a highly impact ?
We 've tried to the exercise with the same students .
What do you think it happened ?
They now had understood the value of a prototype .
The same team team , from the worst the best .
They created the highest structure in the minor time .
So , I 'm going to ask you about the nature of incentives and the success of the incentives and the success of a marshmallow challenge ?
The reason is this : help create digital tools and processes to help groups building , video games and visual effect .
And what it makes a marshmallow is to help identify the hiddeenges .
Why , every project has his marshmallow , isn 't that ?
The challenge is a shared experience , a common language , a common language to build a prototype .
And so , this is the value of experience , this simple exercise .
And those of you were interested , it can go to marshmallow challengeement .
It 's a blog where you can give a look at how to build the marshmallow .
There 's step .
There are crazy examples from all around the world about how people runs and traves the system .
There 's also the record of the world .
And the most important lesson , I think , is that design is really a sports of contact .
It takes the employees of all the senses , and the use of the finished reasonments , sensations and manuality to manage the challenge that you have in your hand .
And sometimes , a small prototype of experience is everything that is necessary to turn a huh-oh moment .
And it can really make a difference .
Thank you very much .
Let 's end up with a machine , big , beautiful , beautiful , at TED style , it 's a time machine .
All in this room have to go .
You can go back , you can 't go back ; you can 't stay where you are .
And I 'd be curious to know what you choose , because I asked it to my friends in the last few times , and everybody wants to go back .
I don 't know .
I don 't know .
I 'm convinced that there 's a kind of return to the nostalogy , the illusions .
I understand it .
But I don 't do part of that group , I have to admit .
I don 't want to go back , and not why I wouldn 't go back , it 's because the possibility of this planet don 't go back .
So , I want to go into the machine and I want to go forward .
This is the best period that there 's been on this planet in every field that we can measure : health , wealth , mobility , opportunity , heat rates of disease .
It 's never been a time like this .
My great-grandparents die , everybody , first of the 60 years .
My grandandparents were that number in 70 .
My parents are going to touch the 80 .
So it 's better than there is a nine at the beginning of my death .
But it 's not just about people like us , it 's a much bigger of this .
A child was born in New Delhi today can expect to live as much as a rich man in 100 years ago .
Think about it . It 's an incredible fact .
How does it be true ?
Just . The smallpox has killed billions of people on this planet .
It changed the global demography of global as no war did .
If it 's gone .
We defite it . Puff .
In the rich world , disease , diseases that were mining millions of people just a generation is not exist .
Rear , chicken --
Can somebody know what ?
Vaccines , medicine , our ability to feeds billions of people , these are triures of the scientific method .
And I think , the scientific method , trying to do things , see if it work , it 's one of the great results of humanity .
These were the good news .
Unfortunately , they were the good news because there are other problems , and they have been quoted a lot of times , like one of them is that , although , what we 've got , a billion people goes to bed on this planet , every day .
This number is growing , with incredible rapidity , and it 's green .
And not only , we used our creativity to fill the rejection the planet .
It 's pounds , ground farming , pluvial forest , pluvial , oil , natural gas : they 're disappearing , and they 're disappearing quickly , and if we don 't invite our actions to pull us out of this guaiius .
So the question is , we can do that ? I think it 's yes .
I think it 's clear that it 's possible to produce food to feed for billions of people without violent the earth that live on .
I think it 's possible to provide this world without this energy world .
I really think about it , and no , it 's not an illusion .
But here 's the thing that keeps me at night -- one of the things that keeping me at night .
We 've never had to be progress of scientific progress as we need now , and we 've never been in the position of using them to the better than we could now today .
We 're at a stage of incredible events , very , in many ambites .
But despite this , I think we should go back centuries , 300 years , first of Illuminism , to find a period in which we fight the progress , a period in which we combated them more vigorously , and in front of what we do now .
People get intricks in what they believe , and they do it with a lot of force that we can 't get to clean .
In fact , the truth of the truth .
About , everybody has brought to your opinion ; they also direct their opinion about progress , but you know what do you do you do not ?
You can 't do it . I 'm sorry , I 'm sorry , you can 't .
I put a little bit to understand it .
A decline of years ago , I wrote a story about " The New Yorker , a brief article .
And I was studied that somebody opposed , that it was against what it is , after all , the most effective public health .
I didn 't know what to do , so I did as usually , I wrote the story , and I did .
Not much later , I wrote a story about genetically modified food .
Same thing , only bigger .
People were employed .
So I wrote a story about that , and I couldn 't figure out why people considered the OGM as " food shows , " because they thought they can move the molecules in a specific way , instead , instead of nature 's work .
But , like , I do my job . I wrote the story and went on .
I mean , I 'm a journalistic journalist : Let 's say , we 'll end up there .
But these stories were , and I couldn 't understand why , but at the end , I did it .
The problem was that those fanatics that they were doing me store were not fanatics .
They were in consciousness , educated , people for good .
They were exactly like people in this room .
And the thing was disturbed very --
but then I thought , we have to be honest ; we 're at a point , on this planet , where we don 't have the same relationship with progress that there was once .
We 're talking about environment .
We talk in ironic terms of ironics using the virgoletty , " Right , " OK , there 's reason , there are reasons to do it , and I think we know what they are .
We lost confidence in institutions , in authorities , and sometimes in science , and it 's understanding that it 's happened .
You can only do a few names and people understand .
Chernobyl , Bhopal , Challenger , Challenger , Vioxx , weapons of mass destruction , elections .
I mean , each one has his list .
We have questions and problems with the people that we thought were right .
So you 're skeptics .
Let me questions , you pay answers , praying .
Don 't tell you .
But here 's the fundamental point : when the evidence is needed to accept them , and we 're not very good at this .
And I think the reason is that we 're in an epidemic of fear that I had never seen and hopefully never seen .
About 12 years ago , it was a horrible story , a horrible story , which supported there was a law between autism of autism and vaccines against it .
Very .
Hundreds of studies were made to see if it was true .
And they had to do hundreds of studies ; it 's a big question .
And it turned out the data .
The United States from the United States , from Sweden , from Sweden , from Canada , and everybody was equal , no correlation , nothing .
It didn 't make it difference . It didn 't do it because we believe in the anecdots , what we see is about what we think about , about what we think about it .
We don 't think of a documents that are forced by employees that show us numbers , and I understand it , I think we all understand it .
But you know what ?
The results have been devastating --
It 's devastating because there is a few countries to the United States is one of the few countries in the world that the number of vaccines against the dead .
It 's horrible , and we should be vergame of ourselves .
It 's terrible .
What happened that it 's happened to us to do something like that ?
Now , I understand it .
Think of that , somebody have the dead ?
Anybody of the audience has ever seen a person die of die ?
It 's not often .
In this country doesn 't happen right , but it happened 160,000 times in the world last year .
I 'm a little bit of deaths of deaths , 20 every hour .
But since it doesn 't happen here , we can take away from the heads , and people like Jenny McCarthy can go around the messages of fear and ignorance of fear and ignorance of fear and ignorance .
And they can 't do it because they don 't understand the difference between causality and correlation .
They don 't understand that these two things seem equal , but they 're not almost ever .
But it 's something that we need to learn , and we have to learn it quickly .
This man was a hero , Jonas Salk .
It 's liberated the humanity from one of his worst flages .
No fear , no suffering -- no suffering .
The man at the center , not as much .
It 's called Paul Offit .
It 's just created a vaccine against other people .
He saved the lives of 400 thousand children every year in the developing world .
It 's bad , right ?
It 's optimate , if it wasn 't that Paul goes around talking about vaccines , it says how precious and people should just stop to restop .
And it says in these terms .
So Paul was considered a terrorist .
When Paul talks in a public udience can 't testimony without an arms .
They call it at home because at a few we like to remind where his children go to school .
Why ? Because Paul created a vaccine .
I don 't need to say , but the vaccines are fundamental .
If we stop taking , the diseases return , terrible disease , and it 's happening .
We new the dead in this country .
And it 's going to be worse , and it 's not a lot of the children will die again because it 's just a number of numbers .
And they 're not going to die .
The polio ? Right ?
One of the colleagues of the college has written a couple of weeks ago , and he told me a little bit .
No one was told to me before .
She wouldn 't get his child against the chicky .
It 's not going to die .
OK .
Why ? Why is not the polio . But you know what ?
Yesterday , we didn 't have the polio in the United States .
I don 't know -- I know , maybe stamin a guy is salito an airplane in Lagos and is coming to Los Angeles , now it 's over the Ohio .
It 's going to land in a couple of hours , it 's going to take a machine , it will be in Long Beach and stasera to one of these fantastic couple of TED car .
He didn 't know it 's been infected by a paralyzed disease , and we don 't even know , because it 's how the world works .
This is the planet that we live in . We don 't end up as well .
We love a circuit . Let 's do it .
Everybody got the vitamines ?
Echines , a little bit of antiossidant to start the day .
I know you 've done it because half of the Americans do it every day .
Take that stuff , as they get the alternative medicine , and it doesn 't matter how often we 're unuuuseful .
The data shows it .
They get the more swimming urine .
But it 's good , you want to spend 28 billion dollars for scure , are with you !
Urine .
Why do we do it ? Why ?
I think we 're going to figure out the great drug homes .
We don 't true machine . We don 't trust .
And we do good . Our health system is suck .
It 's cruel to millions of people .
It 's absolutely , incredibly cold and demoralizing , also for those of us who can afford .
So we go away away , and what do we refugee ?
Let 's running between the big placebo arms .
It 's amazing . We love the great placebo .
You know , it 's a serious problem because this stuff is a schip , and we spend billions of dollars .
I 've got a whole series of examples here .
Nobody of these ginkering -- a frode , echines , echines -- I don 't even know what it is , but we spend billions of dollars , and it 's a frode .
You know one thing ? When I say these things , people are me against , and they say , " But what you 're interested in ? Let people do want .
It 's good . "
Do you have to go back .
Because I don 't interested in whether it 's the secretation of the Department for Salute and Servites , I don 't intention to hear the evidence of experts on the mography , " or whether it says it 's a few longer than the cancer , " or a few longer than the cancer .
When we imbock the street that leads to reduce science and proves with magic and tradition and tradition , we end in a place where we wouldn 't want to be .
Let 's like Thabo Mbeki in South Africa .
He killed 400 thousand of his conceptual conceptual boundaries , and it 's just going to work better than anti-retroviral drugs that we know can slow down the AIDS decord .
Hundreds of thousands of unuseful deaths in a country that has been collected more than any other from this disease .
Please , don 't come to tell me that there are no consequences for these actions .
There are always .
Now , the stupid epidemic that we 're in the middle right now is the war between the sustainors of genetically modified and the biological food .
It 's a idiatrible diatrible .
It 's a diatriba about the words , about metaphors .
It 's ideology , it 's not science .
Every single thing we eat , every chunk of rice , every leaving leaf , every leaves of Bruxelles has been modified by man .
You see , there were no eating in the garden .
There were no melance .
There were no Natal trees . We 've created them .
We did it in the last 11111,000 years .
Something worked and something else doesn 't .
And we eliminated what didn 't work .
Now we can do it more precise .
And there 's risks , of course , there are .
But we can insert things like vitamine A in the rice , and this will help millions of people , millions of people , to take their lives .
And we don 't want to do that ?
I have to tell you , I don 't understand it .
We are against OGM .
Why ?
The things that feel always are : too chemicals , pesticides , pesticides , monoultures , we don 't want to huge camps with the same thing , it 's wrong .
We don 't want the companies put on the patent on life .
We don 't want the companies are unique of seeds .
You know what 's my answer to this ?
It 's yes . You go right .
It 's true , we have a huge problem , but it 's not science .
It has nothing to do with science .
It 's law , morality , languages on the patent .
You know that science is not a corporation .
It 's not a country .
It 's not a idea ; it 's a process .
It 's a process , sometimes gives positive results sometimes not , but the idea that we wouldn 't allow science to do its only because we are fear of millions of people to prove .
You know , in the next 50 years we 're going to make 70 percent .
These are the investment in Africa of the last 30 years .
Vergogue .
They need it , and we don 't need it .
Why ? Cibo ? Cibo .
We don 't want to encourage people to eat slavery .
Let billion people eat it .
It looks like a little bunch .
But it 's only calories . It makes up .
It doesn 't have nutrients , it has no proteins , but the scientists are finding the way to put right now .
So a lot of people could eat less and running less the risk to get clear .
They wouldn 't die of hunger , you know what ?
It would be very beautiful . It woulder , it would be very beautiful .
Can I just wondering , why are we against ?
I mean , ask , why are we obstening this thing ?
Just because we don 't want to move the genes here and there ?
It 's about genes .
It 's not about our obsession for ormons , or of our desire to have bigger food , simple .
There are no Rice Krispies .
It 's about saving life of people , and it would be now start to figure out what it means .
Why do you want to know ? -- if we don 't understand it , and we keep us right now , we 'll be collected right now , we 'll be collected of something that I don 't think we 'd like to mack .
There is no way to describe what 's going on .
It 's horrible , it 's horrible , is in front of us .
So , after this conversation , you might ask me , you might ask me , " You want to go into this ridiculous machine of time and go to the future ? "
Yeah ! I want .
It 's blown on the present now , but we have an incredible opportunity .
We can move the time machine as we want .
We have a chance to do it where we want , and we 'll do it where we want .
We need to do these conversations , and we need to think , but when we go into the machine of time and we 'll be happy to do it .
I know we can and , as far as I think the world needs .
Thank you .
Thank you .
One day , the Los Angeles Times Steve Lopez Times Steve Los Angeles Steve Los Angeles when he sented a beautiful music .
It was coming from a man , an African-American man , fascinating , with the handle tratts , with married a violin that he had just two cords .
I 'm telling a story that many of you know , because the articles of Steve serviruses from basically based on a book , which , by Robert Downey , with Robert Downey , with Robert Downey , and Jamie Fox , and Jamie Fox Fox , and Jamie Fox Foxy in the Nathony Ayers , the against Juthony , the against the Juilliar , which is , which was a confidition of which was interrupted with the interrupted with was interrupt of a very ,
Nathaniel left the Juilliard , it was a terrible nervous , and 30 years longer lights , and 30 years longer lived as a trip of Skid Row in Los Angeles .
And all of you to read the Steve 's book , or to look at the film to understand not just the beautiful law that is created between these two men ,
My name is Jane McGonigal . I 'm a video games .
Realizing giames from 10 years and my objective for the next 10 is to try and make easy to save the world in life as real world as it is in real world .
To do it , I have a plan , and it is in convincing more people , understood to get more time to play games and interesting .
At the moment three billion hours a week playing online .
Some of you might think , " It 's a lot of time to play . "
maybe too long , considering how many urgent urgent problems , we have to solve in the real world .
Actually , according to research , Istitute for the Futural , it 's actually true .
Three billions of hours at the week are not minimately sufficient to solve the problems .
In fact , I think that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we have to increase notice that skin .
I calculated that the total that we need is 21 billion hours of play every week .
It 's probably a control idea a controintuitive , so it reinforce the concept .
If we want to solve problems that hunger , the climate change , the global conflict , global conflict , I think we need to have to have the environment to play online , at least 21 billion hours of the next decade .
That 's why . This image sum summary because I think I play is so important for the survival of human species .
This is a picture of the Phil Toldane , wanted to capture the emotion of play .
So he photographed the players as they players .
And this is a classic emotion .
If you 're not habitual players is possible that you lose some of the stages of this picture .
You probably notice the sense of urgency , a little bit of fear , but also an intense concentration , a very profound attention , a very profound problem .
If you 're habitual players , you 'll notice some details , the pieces around the mouth is a optimism .
And the surprise shows are surprise .
This is a habitual player at a thing called " Epic Victory . "
Ah , it 's a term that you 've already heard . Okay .
So we 've got abitual players between us .
It 's a very good victory is an extraordinary result that it doesn 't seem possible until you can 't even when you don 't get it .
It 's almost beyond the imagination , and when you get us a shock discover what you 're really capable of . This is a driver .
This player is at a step from a major wind .
And this is the expression that we need to see on the face of millions of problems in the world as we face the obstacks of the next hundred years . The expression of somebody , against all of the expectations , is at a passion .
Unfortunately , this is the expression that we see in the life of all days as we try to deal urgent .
This is the expression that I call " Brate . " I 'm not Brate . " And I 'm going to do it ? " Yes . "
I am with the expression " I 'm not Brate . "
This is a graffite in my old neighborhood of Berkeley , California , and California , where I did the game that in real life .
And this is a lot of a lot of habitual players : we feel that we 're not good as good as a games .
And I don 't mean " bad " simply " success " , " even though the success is , we get more results in the online worlds .
But I also mean , " good " in the sense of motivates to do something important , inspired to collaborate and cooperating .
And when we 're in a world online , I think a lot of us become the best versions of ourselves , the versions of us to help without predict , more able to focus on a problem for all the time , to remove after a failing , and try to try a new problem after a failure and try to try a new problem .
And in real life , when we face a failure , when we depressed a obstacle , we don 't feel like this : we often we feel like this : we feel sometimes , maybe depressed , frustrated or movie .
We never try to have these feelings as we turn , simply don 't exist in a game .
So this is what I wanted to study to university .
What is that in a game is that in a game that we can 't get any result ?
How can we move those feelings from games and apply them to the real world ?
So , I studied games like World of Warcraft , which is really the ideal environment to solve problems .
And I began to notice some things that make the epic writing so possible in the online worlds .
The first one is that , when I appears in one of these games , especially in World of Warcraft , there 's a lot of different characters that they trust the world . Fin from a mission .
But not a mission whatever : a perfectly adequated to your current level in the play . Right ?
So you can complete it .
They never give you a challenge impossible .
But it 's at the limit of your skills .
But there is no desocket in World of Warcraft , you don 't spend the policy , there 's always something specific and important to do .
And there 's a lot of collaborators .
Anywhere you go , hundreds of thousands of people , it 's ready to join you to join your epic mission .
It 's not a very common thing that in real life , this feels that we have a lot of collaborators .
And there 's also this kind of narratic narrative , this narrative that involves , and what we 're doing .
And then we get this positive feedback .
You 've heard about increase , and it 's force , and more force .
We don 't get that kind of feedback in real life .
When I leave this stage , it 's not going to talk about a audience , and it 's a bizarre ideas .
I didn 't get that kind of feedback in real life .
Now , the problem of collaborative environments like World of Warcraft is that gives so much satisfaction to be at a step from a winter patterns , that we decide to pass all our time in the play .
It just is better than the reality .
It 's why , right now , collectively all the World of Warcraft has spent 5,93 million years to solve solve solve the problems of Azeroth .
This is not necessarily something negative .
But I put it in perspective : 5,93 million years ago was the period in which one of our ancestors , in which one of our ancestors .
That was the first primate walking .
Okay , so when we talk about how much time we 're investing into the playing , the only manivered sensation , is to talk about times the human evolution , which is a extraordinary thing , but useful thing , because we 've discovered that we 've discovered that we 've discovered that time , we 're changing what we 're going to collaborate more and more heart .
This is true , I think .
So , let 's look at this interesting statistics .
It was recently published by a Carnagie Mellon Carnagie Mellon .
The typical young average today in a country with a very strong culture of habitual players , will have past 10,000 hours playing online , 21 years old .
10,000 hours is a very interesting number for two reasons .
First of all , for children in the United States 10,000,000-hours is the number of hours of hours to the maturity if you 're present all the days .
So we have a whole parallel of parallel education in which the young people learn how to be .
And some of you will have probably read the new book of Malcolm Gladwell , " Fuoriclasse . "
If you 've got a little bit of the success , the theory of the 10,000 hours for success .
It 's founded on an optimate research in the cognition of cognition , that we 're going to 10,000 hours of the fruit to a 21 years , we 're going to be in that field .
We 're going to be good at that as the best people in the world .
So , what we have now at disposition is a whole generation of young people who are genes of the game .
So , the question is , " What do is , what do you burst these players get ? "
because if we could figure out what it 's about a disposition of human resources .
This is the number of people in the world who are at least a day to play online .
These are our genes of play .
500 million people who are extraordinary -- in something .
And in the next decade , we 're going to have another billions of billion people that are extraordinarily good at that .
If you don 't know , you know , this is what you expect : the video video game industry is developing platforms that consuming energy and work with the Internet , instead of the Internet , so , in particular India , China , in particular , China , Brazil , in particular India , China , Brazil , China , Brazil , they can connect online .
The estimate is a billion players in the next decade .
This is going to take us to 1.5 billion players .
So I started thinking under what these games are transforming us into genes .
These are four aspects that I individuated . The first is a optimism .
Okay . Think as a self-motivation .
A hurgent urgent is the desire to acting a obstacking a obstacle , with the convinction of having a reasonable hope of success .
The habitual players believe that a lot of eepy is possible , and it 's worth as possible , and try it now .
The abitual players are not with your hand .
The habitual players are virtuous in table .
There are a lot of research that shows how we 're better with other people after we 've played with them , even though they 've played us to sleep .
And the reason is that it takes a lot of confidence to play with somebody : we have trusting the same rules and with the same rules , and with the same rules and with the same goal , and they 'll restay to the conclusion of the play .
So , playing together , building the lines of trust and cooperation .
So , the result that we really have better social relationships .
Just productivity .
You know , there 's a reason that the average player of World of Warcraft player 22 hours a week , almost as a part-time job .
It 's because we know , while we 're playing , that we are really happy working soon , rather than reaxing us or lose .
We know that we 're optimize , like being human , to work sodo something that has meant .
And the habitual players are willing to work expensive , if it was assigned a task .
To finally , a bad meaning .
The habitual players love to be associated with wonderful missions , human scale .
For example , a little information to help create a context .
You know all Wikipedia , the biggest wiki in the world .
The second wiki in the world , with almost 80,000 articles is the World of World of Warcraft Cin5 million people use it every month .
They 've got more information on World of Warcraft in Warcraft in the Internet , which about anything else in the world .
They 're building a lot .
They 're building a bunch of information about World of Warcraft .
Okay , these are the four superpotherers that together one thing .
The habitual players are individuals of big super-powered super-powers .
These are people who believe that they 're individually able to change the world .
The only problem is that they believe that they 're able to change the virtual worlds , but not real .
This is the problem that I 'm trying to solve .
There 's a named Edward Castronoves .
And his studies are brilliant . It 's studying why people investing so much time , energy and money , energy and money , in the online worlds .
And he says , " We 're looking at what 's less than an expensive to the virtual worlds and play . "
And it 's a econom , so it 's rational , and it says -- not like me , I 'm a games of games , I 'm exuberant --
But he says this is a perfectly thing that 's a perfectly sensed thing , because the habitual players can get more in online in the real life .
They can have more solid social relationships in a game that not in real life .
They have better feedback in a better feedback in a game that not in real life .
So , it 's right now , it 's perfectly reasonable for the players , pass more time in virtual virtual world that I agree that this is reasonable , I agree that this is reasonable , but it 's not , in a way , an ideal situation . We need to start to make the real world more like a game .
Here I traging here from something that happened 2500 years ago .
These are ancient bones , made of bones of bone pecora Prime to have a joysticks and wonderful and wonderful beautiful . And these represent the first tools from humanity .
If you know , you 'll know the advance of historical history , Erodote , perhaps you already have this story .
It 's the story of the games and why .
It was narre that games , in particularly the games of dadi , were invented in the realm of Lidia , in a period of charactery .
It was so several that was so several , that the king of the Lidia decided to do something .
People suffered , the population was in reverse , they need a extreme extreme solution .
So , in Erodote , invented the games of and emanned a whole bunch of all the reality .
One day , everybody was eating .
The next day , everybody would play .
And it immersed so deeply in the games of , since the moment that playing is so involving , and immerging us in a state of judge productivity , which they ignored the fact that they don 't have anything to eat .
And so one day they played , and one day .
And according to Erote , they past 18 years , survive on the character eat a day and playing the following .
I think this is exactly the way we use games in the day .
We use games to the suffering of the real world .
We use games to get away from everything that doesn 't work in our real environment , from all that we don 't satisfaces us of real life , and we get what we need from games .
But we need to stop here .
This is decisionally interesting : Actually , after 18 years , the charactery didn 't talk to better , so the decided they 'd play a last game a final game .
And I was the entire realm at half , and the winners of that participation , and the winners of that participation .
They went to the Lidia , and they went to look for a new land where they could live , left behind the number of people to survive with the resources of people to survive with the available resources , with the hope to bring their civilization from somewhere else , where it would have prosperous .
Is it a little bizarre idea , right ?
But recently , DNA studies have revealed that the Etrush that the Ethushed that they would bringing the same DNA of anti-people of Lidia .
So , recently , scientists have suggested that the narrate story .
And geologists have found out of a global cooling that dured almost 20 years and that could explain the charactery .
So this incredible story could be truly save : they could actually save their culture playing , refugee in the games for 18 years and then inspired to be so inspired , and I know how well I 'm met in the game of the game .
Okay , we can do it .
We 're going to Warcraft from 1994 .
It was the first game strategy in real time of World Warcraft of World of Warcraft . This 16 years ago .
They played for 18 years , we 've played in Warcraft for 16 years .
I say , we are ready for our epic game .
They would be half the population of a new world .
It 's from here that 21 billion hours of play a week .
Let 's do the half of us according to get a day to play , until we can 't solve the problems of the real world .
I guess what you 're going to ask , " How we do to solve the problems of the real world in a game ? " Well , this is what I 've dedicated my work during the past years , pressed the Istitute .
In our Palo 's offices of Palo . We have this standing our idea of how we should relate to the future .
We don 't want to try to predict the future .
What we want to do is -- the future .
We want to imagine scenarios from the best results , and then we want to give the possibility of people to turn them into reality .
We want to figure out epic that to make people the tools to realize them .
I 'm going to show you three games that I realized , and I 'm a trying to give people the tools to create the epic of the epic in their future .
This is " Mond Petrolium . "
We did this game in 2007 .
It 's a online .
The charity is not real , but we have published sufficient material , online that is , and to make living real life as if we were to dry . So , when you enters in the game , you recording , you comunique in the game , you recorded you , in fact , the things that show exactly the cost of the oil , the things that are not available , the impact on the distributed of food ,
the impact on the transportation , if there are closed , if there are rimetimes , and you have to think about how you live in your life , if all this was real . He asked you to have a blog about it , to publishing video , to publish it , to publishing video --
We 've seen this game with 1,700 players in 2007 , and we 've looked at them from then for three years , and what I can say is that it 's a experience that transform .
Nobody wants to change the maniera in which only because it 's a good thing for the world or because it 's a good thing for the world or because it 's a good thing .
But if I immersive adventure and say , " We don 't have oil .
This is an incredible story ! Unadventure that you can participate !
Sfile itself to see how I survive . "
Most of our players have learned the habits that has learned in the game .
So , for the next to play the world , we decided to save the world , we decided to my higher problem of oil .
We did a game called Superstruct , to Istitute for the Futer , and the premise was : a supercomputed that humanity has only other 23 years on this planet .
The supercomputer called " Estination of Estination of Estination . " Of course . "
We asked people to achieve online us online in a Jerry Bruckheimer .
Jerry Bruckheimer Bruckheimer , shape a team . There 's an astronauty , scientist , galeotto scientist , galeott , and they all have something to save the world , but in our game , instead of having only five people in the team , and it 's joined your energy , the future of the food , the future of the food , the future of the resource , the future of the food , the future of the resource , the future of the resource of the resource of the resource of the resource of the resource ,
8,000 people have played for eight weeks , have generated 500 incredibly creative solutions that you can find if you go on Google , " Superstruck " Superstruct . "
And finally , the last game , it 's going to start the third of march . This is a game with Istitute of the World Bank .
If you completes the game is going to be certified by Istitute of the World Bank , like the Nort Social Bank , classroom , 2010 .
Working with universities for sub-Saharan Africa , we 're inviting them to learn the techniques of social innovation .
There 's a story about comics , you increase , thank you very much about local knowledge , collaboration , sustainability , imagination and inventive .
I want to invite all of you to share this game with the young people , everywhere in the world , in particular areas in the developing world , which might benefit from the unable to the world .
It 's time to conclude .
I want to ask a question .
What do you think that 's going to happen ?
We have all these incredible players , we have these games that are pilot of what we could do , but no one of these has still saved the real world .
Well , I hope you 've agreed with me that the habitual players are a human resource that we can use to do of the real world , that the games are a powerful powerful platform for the change , that we have these incredible superpowerful , a job productivity , that we have these incredible social pattern , this is the ability to be a pattern .
I really hope that we can come against to play games that have importance , to survive on this planet for another century , and my hope is that you unique to me in the realize and participate with games like these .
When I look at the next decade , of two things are certain things : that we can realize whatever we can imagine , and we can play whatever we want .
So , I 'm going to tell the games are going to change the world .
Thank you .
For a few time , I 'm interested in the placebo , it can look like a strange thing that a magician of them , unless you consider my view , you know , " something fake is believed to get something about this . " In other words , the zar spot of sugar , " In other words , the zar pills have a measured effect , only because the person think of it is , only because the person think of it is , just because the person think of it 's words
that what 's happening is a drug , or something like similar --
The therapy of the pain , for example , if they believe that you have a measraable effect in the body called placebo effect .
Something becomes with something true for perception that has it .
So , I want to show you a magical trick , very simple .
And I 'm going to show you how it works . This is a trick that 's present in all the children in the ' 50s .
I learned it from only with Cub Scout Magic in the 190s .
I 'm going to do it for you and therefore I 'll explain it .
And so I 'm going to explain why I explained it .
That 's what happens .
The television , you can examinate ; my hand , you can examining .
I 'm going to just give the pick in my mind , like this .
I was on the manics .
To make sure nothing goes or savings from my manics .
I 'm saying my wild .
So that you can see that something can go .
And the purpose of this is simple .
I 'm going to open my hand , and if it 's all good , my animal magnetism is going to be the knight .
Actually , so I jump to his place that , and the knight it doesn 't fall .
Nothing goes on or down my manics .
no trick . You can examinate anything .
Ta-da !
This is a trick that often I teach children .
and they 're interested in magic , because you can learn a lot about this trick even if metodologically , it 's very simple .
A lot of you in this room will know this trick .
This is what happens to do is in my hand .
I 'm going to save my wind my wind .
in order to make sure that nothing jums or wild out of my manics , this is a good .
The reason I 'm telling the wind of light .
In the moment that my hand moving moving away from you , this finger here , my index here , my index , you 've got to have a position that points out of this .
There is somebody who had no childhood here .
It 's like this , right .
And when I turned out the finger .
We can talk about why it is engages , because you don 't notice that there 's only three fingers down because the mind , and the way to process information , it doesn 't matter , one , two , three . He sharp .
But that 's not the point . Right ? And when I open my hand , Obviously remains not through the animal magnetism , but through the engineer , being my index here .
And when I close my finger , same thing , when you go back , this movement cover the finger .
I 'm going to do the hand .
It 's a trick that you can do with your friends and neighbors . Thank you .
Now , what has to do with the placebo effect ?
I read a studio , a year ago that I spent my mind .
I 'm not a doctor or a researcher or a researcher .
It seems that if you reach a placebo in the form of a white pills , made as a bunch , just a white pills , just a white pills , it has a measure effect .
But if you change the shape and you give the placebo , under a pill , and the blue color and print you and print you and practice you are more effective .
Even though no sugar drug -- they 're pills of sugar .
But a white pill is not effective as a blue pill .
What ? I really stood .
But anyway , it 's not here .
The heads are more effective than the pasts of every form .
A couple of colored , which is yellow up and red by the other is better than a white capsule .
The doxage has a role .
One pill two times a day is not so effective as three pills -- I don 't remember the statistics .
But the point is --
-- that these doxages have a role .
And it also shape has a role .
And if you want to say , you have to use a needle .
Right ? One syringe with something -- a couple of c.cket .
it into a patient --
This is an image so strong in their mind , much more stronger than the pillar pill .
It 's real , this graph -- I 'm going to show you another time when we 're going to have another time when we 're going to have .
The point is that the blue pill is not effective as the blue , which is not effective as the capsule , which is not as a needle .
And no one of these has a pharmaceutical quality .
It 's just your belief that makes them in your cover and rather the effect .
I wanted to see if I could take this idea and apply it to a magic trick .
And to do something that 's a trick and do it seems to be real .
And we know from the study that when you want a effect needs to use the needs .
This is a seven inch of seven inches , Multy .
The sterile a little bit .
This is my meat . This is not Carne special of Damian .
This is my skin . This is not a special effect hollywood .
I 'm going to hole my skin and get this needs to the opposite side .
If you try nausea -- if you 're easily -- I did it for some friends in the albergo , the other night , and for a few that I didn 't know , and a woman was almost .
So , if you try to have easily , I suggest that you don 't look for the next 300s -- in fact , you know , I 'll do the first part here .
You can see , you can look at the other side .
And that 's what happens , right here , the beginning of my bad part of my arm , just a little hole .
Sorry . Do I 'm impressive ?
And now a little bit through my skin , and out of the other side , so .
Now , we 're in the same position we were in the same position of the knife .
More or less . But you can 't count my finger right now , right ?
So I 'll show you . Here 's one , two three , four , five . Yes , good .
I know what people think when you see that .
They think , " Surely isn 't going to be so stupid to the skin just for fun a few minutes . "
So , let me give you a bunch .
How does it look like it ? Well , it 's good .
Yes , I know what I 'm going to say , " OK , I don 't see it good . "
People in the stances are entering .
Let me show you closer .
This is really my skin . It 's not a special effect of Hollywood .
This is my meat , and I can turn it around .
Sorry , if you look at the other side , don 't look at it .
The people in the bottom or going to look in a few years , it 's going to say , " Well , it 's clear that will be true , but if he was true him --
You can see there 's a hole here and a hole here , if it was true . "
Well , I 'm doing a little bit of blood for you .
So here .
I mean , I 'd listen to the needs .
I 'd like my arm , and I 'll show you that there are no ferred .
But I think in this context and with the idea of taking something true , and turned it into something true , I 'll leave it from the stage .
We 're going to see several times in the next few days . I hope that you don 't see the hour . Thank you very much .
So , in my life I met a lot of fish .
I just loved two .
The first one , it 's more than another passional story .
It was a beautiful fish , it was a beautiful fishing , one of the older menu .
That 's the fish .
It 's even better , it comes from a docted dopted standards of environmental sustainability .
So , you feel at the consciousness in sell it .
I was involved in a relationship with this beauty for different months .
One day , the head of the company called me and asked to talk to a dedicated to the environmental sustainability .
" Of course , I said .
This was a company that was a company trying to solve what 's became a unimaginable problem for our chef .
How do we continue to have the fish in our menu ?
During the last 50 years , we have fish in the same way that we have rass to the ground .
The destruction was tremendous .
90 percent of the big fish , the ones that we like so much of the tuns , halize , halizes are reduced by numbers .
There 's not almost nothing .
So , we enjoy or less acquiling , the heaving of fish , it 's going to be part of our future .
There 's a lot of contrary arguments .
The fishes of weighing fish , at least most of them , and they 're inefficient . You take the ton for example .
A big problem is that there 's a conversion is that there is a rate of conversion of 15 to one .
This means that it takes 15 labor of wild fish to get a lists of wild .
It 's not very sustainable .
And the knowledge is not a big .
So here , finally , there was a company that was trying to do it in the right way .
I wanted to help them .
And the day of the day , I got the public relationships of the company .
Don .
" Don , I said , " I said , " Well , you 're famous to understand good , you 're famous to do it , in opened , not polluted . "
" Exact , " he said , " We are so far from the coast that our coast of the coast that our scars are not concentrated . "
And then he added , " We 're basically a world . "
" The rate of conversion ? 2.5 to one said . "
" The best in the sector . "
2.5 to one , fantastic .
" 2.5 to one thing ? What do you do you do to the fish ? "
" Ssustainable Proteining , he said .
" Great , I said . And asked the phone call .
That night , I was in bed , I thought , but it 's a sustainable protein ?
So the next day , a little before , I still called Don .
I said , " Don , do you have a few examples of sustainable proteins ? "
He said he didn 't know , and he would asked around .
Well , I talked to a little bit of the people and nobody severs give me a precise response .
Finally , I was talking to biologist .
We also call him him Don .
" Don , I said , " Do you have a few examples of sustainable proteins ? "
Well , he mentioned a few eats eur base of fish , and then he said , " People . "
I said , " Peze of chicken ? "
He said , " Yes , you think , skin , skin , scarts and processed to eat . "
I said , " What percentage of your eat is made of chicken ? "
I thought , let 's say , two percent .
" Well , it 's about 30 percent said . "
I said , " Don , what is there 's a sustainable to the fish of chicken to eat ? "
There was a long purpose to the phone and then he said , " There 's too much chicken in the world . "
And I waiting about this fish .
No , not because I 'm one of those virtuous virtuous fashion food .
Well , to say the truth .
No , in fact , I disamored about this fish because , you know , after that conversation , the fish .
The second fish is a different love story .
It 's a romantic story for that kind of history to know fish and more love it .
I eat it for the first time in a restaurant in the south of Spain .
A friend of mine journalistic journalist of this fish .
It basically had made us meeting .
The table of the table had a white color , almost wintilate .
The chef brought him too .
It 's basically double .
Incredibly , it was very delicious .
Who is able to make a lot of fish so good after you have the strax ?
I don 't , but this guy .
Miguel .
It 's actually called Miguel .
No , he didn 't have the fish , and it 's not a chef .
For less , in the sense that we usual .
It 's a biologist in Vet . The Palma , which is a fish in the sudoction of the Spain of the river 's footage .
Until the 1980s , it was managed by argentines .
They were on the bowins on what it was essentially a paludose .
They had given the ground building a series of canals with the water in the river in the river .
Well , they couldn 't make it work out of economics .
And , from the ecological view , it was a disaster .
He killed something like 90 percent of the birds and , considering the place , it 's a lot of birds .
So , in 1982 , a Spanish company with a environmental consciousness .
What did they do ?
They start the flow of the action .
Leterally , invert the switch .
Instead of sharing the water out of terrain using the canals to inhoning it .
They give all the channels .
They have a 27 thousand acres of the weaving of 27 thousand acres and anguills and anguills and this process , Miguel and this company company company .
It 's incredible .
I mean , it 's never seen something like this .
Look at the horizon that seems to be far away a million miles and everything that you see are the unusual canals and this rich rich , dense land lagunds .
I 've been a little time ago with Miguel .
It 's an amazing three quarter Charles Darwin and a quarter Crocodile Dundee .
Okay ? We were doing in the middle , and I was going on , I was going on , I was going to have the knees of the knees and Miguel and Miguel , hotels .
First , a white rare of a white rare .
Then I explains the mineral of the phytoplanes , then you see a kind of weighs of weighs that reminds the giraffs of the Tanzania .
It turns out that Miguel has spent a lot of his career in the National Mikumi in Africa .
I asked him how it became an expert of fish .
He said , " I don 't know anything about fish .
I 'm a relationships . "
And later , it 's going to launch on a birds , and strange plants and strange plants .
Don 't get me , all this was very fascinating , that was very fascinating , one thing like biotic is revealing .
Yeah , it 's interesting , but I was in love love .
And my head continued to rethink about that of the heads fish that I had eat night .
So the interrupt and I said , " Miguel , what makes your fish ? "
He indicated the algae .
" I know , I know , the algae , the fitoplanguage , yes , relationships , yes , it 's incredible .
But your fish what they eat ?
Now , what 's your rate conversion ?
Well , I 'm going to tell me about how their both is a rich system so the fish eat exactly what eat a willing environment .
The biomass of plants , the fitoplancton , the zooplancton , is all that feed the fish .
The system is so on the health , and it completely completely .
There 's no eat .
Do you ever heard about a level that 's not eating to eat his animals ?
The later , I was driving driving around the ground with Miguel and I said , " In a place like this natural seems so natural that it seems to have ever seen , how do you measure the success ? "
At that moment , it was like a movie , it was like a movie had ordered the changes .
We got the angle and we saw a scene between the most incredible of thousands and thousands of phenicopy , and thousands of phenicoped with the eye .
" That 's the success , he said .
" Look at their pink .
They 're banking . "
Banchetty ? I was completely confuse .
I said , " Miguel , but they 're not banking with your fish ? "
" Yes , he said . "
" Let 's just 20 percent of the fish and the eggs of fish for the birds .
Last year on this last year , there were 6000,000 birds more than 250 species .
It became the biggest and one of the most important healthcare for birds in Europe . "
I said , " Miguel , but a lot of birds of bird is not the last thing that you 'd like to a fish ? "
It covered the head , no .
He said , " We allew extensive not to an extensive way .
This is an ecological network .
Phenicopter eat the leg .
The leg eating the fitoplankton .
So , it 's much more rose is rose the grandscape is the system . "
Okay , then it 's not going to be eating to eat his animals and measure his success in the base health of the basic health of his predators .
A birds .
Ah , by the way , those phenicopter wouldn 't even be there .
They do the nest in a 150 miles where the soil is better conditions to the nest of the nest of the nest .
Every morning , they fly for 150 miles , and they get up and every night , you do 150 miles for the back .
They do it because they 're able to follow the white line of the A92 cars .
I seriously .
I was sitting something like the penguins of penguins so I looked at Miguel .
And I said , " Miguel , fly for 150 miles to the treatment and then fly down 150 miles of night to go back ?
They do it for their little ? "
I 'm looking at how if I just citated a song of Whitney Houston .
He said , " No , they do it because food is better . "
I didn 't talk to you about the skin of my fish loved fish , and I usually don 't like the skin of the fish .
I don 't like embrace , I don 't like cruster .
It 's that known up , like asphalt .
Don 't cooking almost never .
And yet , when I took it into that restaurant of the south of Spain didn 't know for anything about fish .
He had a knowledge and clean to clean at the ocean .
I said this to Miguel , and he gave .
He said , " The skin is like a sponge .
It 's the last defense before any of the fish .
It 's evolved to treat impurity . "
And then added , " But our water has no impurity . "
Okay . It doesn 't feed his fish .
It 's a picture that measure the success of its predators .
And then I realize that when he says that the allevel doesn 't have a lot of minimizing what the water fluid is the river from the river . And it 's a river that 's a river to the river . And it 's all the things that the river tend to bringing objackaging chemicals .
And when you go down the system and it comes clean water is cleaner than when it 's entered .
The system is so on health , which public water .
So , not just a level that doesn 't feed his animals not only a treatment that measure its success in the health of its success in the health of water , but it 's literally a purpose of water and not only for those fish , but also for me and for you .
Because when the water , it goes in Atlantic .
It 's a drop in the ocean , I know , but I do the wells you , and so you should also do because this story of love for how romantic love is also instructive .
It could say it 's a recipe for the future of the good food is that you 're talking about fish .
What we need now is a radically new conception of agriculture in which food is really good .
But for many people , this is too radical .
We 're not realists , we 're very passionate of food .
We 're aming .
Let 's address of small farmers .
I love the little familiar factories .
Let 's talk about local territory .
Let 's move biological biological .
And when you say that these are the things that are going to make sure the future of the good food , somewhere , you know , and he says , " Hi , you know , you know , I like the phenicopters , but how could you feed the entire world ?
How do you think we could feed the world ? "
Can I can be synched ?
It 's a question that I don 't like .
No , not because we produce more than enough calories that we could feed the world .
A billion people suffer the hunger today .
A billion -- more than we 've ever been -- because of the enormous following it in the distribution of complexial distribution .
You see , I don 't like this question because it has determined the logic of our food system in the last 50 years .
Day cereal herbives to the pestictures , chemicals to chemicals , chemicals to the fish and in all this period of agricultural industry just asked , " If we can get more people more cheap , what 's there 's wrong in what we do we do ? "
This is motivation .
It was the justfication .
It 's been the business of the American agriculture .
We should call it for what it is , an industry in liquidation , a quick industry that is ecological capital that makes the ecological capital that makes it possible .
This is not a industry , and it 's not agriculture .
Our landing is threatened not because of the forest , but for the resources , but for the resources in decreation , not for the last mechanics , not for the pummps , but for fresh water fresh , not for fresh water , but for the forests water , but for the forests .
You want to feed the world ?
Let 's start asking : how do we 're going to do ourselves ?
Or better , how can we create the conditions that conditions every local community to feels itself ?
To do that , we don 't look at the model of the future .
It 's a old and standing model .
At all about capital , chemistry and machemistry , and never really produced anything good to eat .
Instead , we look at the ecological model .
It 's what it 's about two billion experience about work .
Let 's look at Miguel , in the allivests like Miguel heads and factories that are not asked in themselves with factories that reconstructing instead of consuming extensively , instead of footprint that only intensively alone , because they 're also expert in relations , because they 're the ones that are also expert in relations , because they are also the ones that are also expert .
If I have to be really sincing them are chef than I could ever be me .
You know , to me , because that 's good , if that 's the future of the good food , it 's going to be delicious .
Thank you .
I grew up with a stand-driven diet .
High high school , an hour , an hour and forth every day .
And I was always immersed in a book , a phanascient book , which took my mind in other worlds , and sleeping , in a narrative , that insatively sense of curiosity that I had .
And that curiosity was also manifestated in the fact that every time I was not at school , I was in a wooods , and serping them at the samples and stagnants , brought them home .
I was a real geek of science .
But it was always trying to figure out the world , understanding the limitation of possible .
And my love for the phantascience actually seemed to answer the world around me , because what was going on , because what was going on , in the 1960s -- we were going to exploring the depth of the ocean , Jacques Csteau entered in our savings , Jacques Csteau entered in our saves , and a wonderful world that showed us and a wonderful world that we can 't even imagine .
So , all seemed to make my passion for phantascience .
And I was a artist .
I knew to draw .
And because there were no video games , it 's this saturation of movie generated computers , and all these images in the media landsces , I had to create these pictures in my head .
From children , when we read a book , we all had to , and we had to put something on the screen , put something on the screen of our heads .
And so , my answer was painting , drawing creatures alien , aliens , robot , aliens , robots , navicles , all this stuff .
At the lessons of mathematics were always dragging behind the textbooks .
This is because creativity had to find a way of using it in some way .
And it 's an interesting thing happened : Jacques Cousteau program Cousteau program , so there was a alien world right here on the earth .
Maybe I never going to a alien world on a alien world on a space .
He looked very unlikely .
But that was a world where I could really go to , right here on the earth , the richer and exotic of what I could ever imagine these books .
So , I decided that I was going to be a narrow at the age of 15 years .
And the only problem was that I lived in a small country of Canada , 600 miles from the ocean .
But I didn 't leave me .
I looked at my father until he found a school immersions in Buffalo , New York , just past the border where we lived .
And so I was able to take the certified in a winter of YMCA , in the winter winter to Buffalo , New York .
And I wouldn 't have seen the ocean , for two years , until two years , until we moved to California .
So , in the last 40 years , I spent about 3,000 hours of water , and 500 of these hours in submersible .
And I learned that the depth of the ocean , even the depth of the deep oceans , are recognize of our imagination .
The imagination of nature is without confined to our limited imagination of human imagination .
Again , I 'm intidied by what I see when I do immersions .
And my love history with the ocean continues , more strong than it 's ever ever ever been .
But when I picked a career , I choose to do movie .
It seemed to be the best way to focus to tell stories with stories to create imagine .
And , as a kid , I was drawing constantly comics and so on .
So the movie was the only way to put images and stories .
Everything back .
And of course , the stories that I choose to tell were stories of phantascience : " Termintator , " Aliens " The Aliens " The Aliens . "
And with " The Abyss , " I unished my love for the depth of a movie .
So , I smoke .
From " The Abyss " The Abyss " The Abyss " The Abyss , this is create the kind of liquid creature of liquid water creature .
And so it was born the first character to surface and computers that we 've ever seen in a movie .
And even though the movie doesn 't have a lot of money , I would say that at sick , I was paid witnessed , I was pnotized by this apparent magic .
You know , it 's the law of Arthur Clarke 's law for which every technology sufficiently moved from magic .
They were seeing something magical .
And this was very excited .
And I thought , " Fantastic , this is something that has to be adopted in the movie . "
So , with " Terminator two , " my next movie , we went a lot of it .
Working with the Industrial Light and Magic , we created the type of liquid metal in that movie .
And it 's worked . And we 've created a magic .
And we got the same result with a audience .
But we got a little bit more with that movie .
So , by using a line between these two points of experience , I came to the conclusion that this would be a new world , it was a whole new world of creativity for the movie artists .
So , I put a society with Stan Winston , my friend friend of Stan Winston , which was the main trucker and designers of creatures in that period , and we called the Digital Digital Domain .
And the principle of the society was leaving the past , the analogical processes and so on , and go directly to the digital production .
And so we did and he gave us a competitive advantage for a while .
But we 're remaining half of the 1990s in the design of creatures and characters , which is what we had founded society .
So , I wrote this textbook called " " " Add-intention of the visual effectively , generated human characters , generated human characters and computers , and all the characters generated characters , and all the characters generated at the entire world .
And it was rested to the mitter .
The kids of society have said that we wouldn 't be able to do it for a little bit .
So , I accantoned , and I did this movie of a big ship that fashion .
I brought it up there like a " Romeo and Juliet on a ship . "
It would be a moment story , a passional movie .
Segretely , what I wanted to do was immerger to see the " Titanic . "
That 's why I did that movie .
And it 's the truth . It didn 't know .
But I convinced them . I said , " We 're going to put it up . We 're going to take it up .
We 're going to use it for the movie .
It 's going to be very important . It 's going to be a fantastic marketing . "
And I convinced them to finance a expedition .
It looks crazy . But this reports us back to the imagination that creates the reality .
Because we really created a six months later I found on a submersible Russian , two miles and a half of depth in the North Atlantic , watching the real Titanic from a oblation , not in a movie , not in a high-definition , but really .
I stood up .
And it took a lot of preparation , we had to build movie and lights and a lot of other things .
But I was restered by those deep dives , it was like a space .
Where was all that was highly technical and required .
You 're going to put in this challenge , you go down to this dark , where there are no hopes of being saved , from you can 't go back to .
And I thought , " Fantastic . It 's like to live in a fiction movies .
It 's really fantastic . "
And so , I was affected from the depth of the depth of the ocean .
Of course , curiosity , scientific component .
It was all . It was happening .
It was curiosity . It was imagination .
And it was a experience that Hollywood didn 't offer me .
Of course , I could imagine a creature and create a visual effect . But I couldn 't imagine what I saw out of the batch .
In our next expeditions , I 've seen creatures with hydrothermal and , sometimes , things that nobody had ever seen before , things that nobody had ever seen before , things that was actually not described by science at the time , and imagined them .
So I was all about this , and I had to do more .
So I took a curious decision .
After the success of Titanic , I said , " Okay , I 'll give my day job in Hollywood register , and I do the explorer to time . "
So , we started planning these expeditions .
We went to the Bismark and explore it with robotic vehicles .
We went back to the Titanic relitation of Titanic .
We took little robots that we had created with sometimes that we had created with the fiber optics .
And the idea was to go inside and make a nave of the nave , which had never been done .
Nobody had ever watched within the rely . They didn 't have the means to do it .
So , here I am on the Titanic , sitting in a submersible , looking at the axes that looked like this , where I knew that they looked like this , where I knew that they had played the violinists .
And I 'm driving a little robotic vehicle through the board .
When I say it , I 'm driving , but my mind is in the vehicle .
And it seemed to be physically present within the speed of Titanic .
And it was the most experience of the most surreal experience that I 've ever lived , because I 've already before to turn the corner , I knew what would have been behind , because I had lost the lights of the vehicle , because I had lost the movie .
And it 's based on a bunch of the nave .
So it was an extraordinary experience .
And it really made me realize that in the telepresence of telepresence that you can experience through these avatar robot , mind is injected in the vehicle , in this other form of existence .
It was very profound .
And it could be a little bit of what could happen between a few decades when we 're starting to have cyborg for the explorations or other motives in some kind of post-human future that I can imagine , from the fantascial future I can imagine .
So , we did these expeditions , and began to appreciate what there was under , like the opening of the depth of the ocean , where there were these ordinary standing animals .
It basically , I 'm alien right here on the earth .
They live in a chemosh environment .
They don 't survive in the sunlight on the sunlight as we do .
So , you can see animals that live close to 500 water corrates .
It looks even impossible that exist .
At the same time , I was interested in space , again , once , again , it 's the flu flu , as a kid .
And I ended in the space environment , really involved with NASA , sitting in the count of the NASA , to planning missions , go to Russia , to go to Russia , to go to Russia protocost of the pre-cosmonauty , and all these things , until the volume , and all of these things , until the volume cameras .
It was fascinating .
But what I ended up to do was bringing the space scientists with us .
And I bring them down because they could have access -- astrobiologists , planetary scientists , planetary scientists , bring them down and allow them to see , heading tools and so on .
So , we were starting with documentary documentary , but we actually make science , space science .
I had closed the ring between being phanascience to be phantasy , to do those things .
And you know , during this path of discovery , I learned a lot .
I learned a lot of science . But I also learned a lot about leadership .
Everybody think it 's got to be a leader , the capitating of the ship , or something like that .
I didn 't know about leadership before to do all those expeditions .
Why I had to say , " What am I doing here ? "
Why I 'm doing it ? What I 'm doing ? "
It 's not going to make all these spectacks .
Let 's go into the parts . There is no famous .
People think , almost thought that I 've gone in " Titanic " and " Homatar " and that I was sitting in the beaches .
I did all these movies , all these documentaries for a limited public .
No , no glory , no glory , no money . What am I doing ?
And I 'm doing it for the task , for the challenge -- and the ocean is the biggest challenge that exists , for the brid of the discovery , and for that strange group of people in shape , when a small group of people shape a team .
Because we did everything with 10-10-10-10-year-old people , working together for years .
Sometimes for 2-3 months .
And in that law , you realize that it 's the important thing is the respect that you have for them and for you , when you have term a task that you cannot explaining anybody else .
When you go back to the ground and you explains , " We had to do this , and the fiber optics , and that , all the technology , and that , all technology , all technology , and the difficulty aspects of human perfootage , when you won , you can 't explain . It 's what maybe only have only the police or soldiers or soldiers that they can 't explain .
Take a launch , create a law of respect .
When I went back to do my next movie , which is " Addenly , I tried to applicate the same principle of leadership to respect the team and changing the team and changes their respect .
It 's really changed the dynamic .
And so here I still once with a small group , in the inexplored to do " Homatar with technologies that didn 't exist before .
Terribly exciting .
Tremendously entering .
And we became a family , in four and a half years .
And it completely changed my way to do movie .
The people commented by saying that I took the organisms from the ocean and I put them on the planet .
For me , it was the essence of doing business , the process that was changed .
What can we have that ?
What are the lessons we learned ?
I think the first is curiosity .
It 's the most powerful thing we can .
The imagination is a force that can actually manifest a reality .
And the respect of the group is more important than everybody 's floor of the world .
Young regists came up to me and say , " Tell me a few advice to do this . "
And I say , " I won 't bried limitations .
Other people are going to do it for you , not alone , you don 't bet against yourself .
And you run up .
NASA is , it always says , " The error is not contemplate . "
But the error must be a option in the art and exploration , because it 's like a vacuum .
And no important attempt that has required innovation was done without risks .
You 've got to be disposed to run these risks .
This is the thought that I want to leave you , that is that in anything you do , the error is a option , but the fear . Thank you .
If I wanted to give you a large idea would be that the data of the data that we consume is bigger than the sum sum of its parts , and that , instead of thinking about how to get new trends , I 'd like to think about how to use new trends , otherwise invisible trends , otherwise invisible .
So , here you see some statistics mortality of organized mortality .
This tools that I use is a little experiment .
It 's called Pivot , and with Pivot , I can choose to filter just a cause of death , say the accidents .
And we can see new relationships .
The reason is that in the central part of the people are more active ; and there are more fragile .
We can do a step back and reorganizing the data because of death of death , we see that diseases and cancer are the greatest Inciated , but not for everybody .
If we go forward and the age of age , let 's say under 40 , we see that the accidents are the causes of death .
It was closer to , most of all for men .
So you 're going to see that visualizing information and data in these way , it 's a little bit like swim in a graphics of information .
And if we can do it with grew data because not the content ?
For instance here , we have the cover of every Sports Illustrated .
All over here .
You can go back to your stances and try and try .
Con Pivot , you can see a decade .
Or a specific year .
You can isolate a particular number .
For example , we take the athletes that appear in this number , their sports .
I 'm a Lance Armstrong , so click here and I see all the numbers where Lance Armstrong .
Now , if I want to give us a look , I could think , " Why don 't you look at all the cylism ? "
I 'm going to take a step back and train the visual .
And I see Greg Lemond .
You know , I realized that when you navigate information in this near way closer or further away from the distant , it 's not just a research , it 's not just a research , is not the usually browser .
But you do something slightly different .
It 's a half of a way that we 're going to change how we could use information .
We still love this idea that it can look a little crazy .
We took every single page of Wikipedia , and we reduced it to a brief that it was in a small synake and an icun-indicates that the thematical area .
I 'll just show you just the early 500 of the living in Wikipedia .
Even in this limited limited screen we can do a lot .
It understood what areas areas areas are living on Wikipedia .
At this point we selected .
Now , this option we see that the categories of Wikipedia more often associated associated with this voice of Anno Time Magazine Time Magazine .
This is significant because it makes to emerging something that in the Wikipedia pages .
And you just see it just doing a step back to see the together .
If I take one of these reurunts , I can zoom on the category of Anno Time Magazine Time Magazine Time Magazine .
and see everybody .
So , I see that most evidence is coming from government . Some of the world from the world of science .
Here 's my head .
One is from the music .
And , what rather interesting , Bono also won a won .
So , we go to see all the winning of the TED winner .
For the first time we 're really navigating in the network as if it was a network , not by page , but at an abstraction .
I want to show you another thing that you might surprising .
This is the New York Times .
Pivot , this application -- we don 't call browser , because it 's not a browser , but we need to see the web pages -- we add this technology for the zoom to every web , like this .
I can do a step back , and I 'm going to go back to a specific section . This is important because the Web pages so show me all my navigation in the same way .
I can zooming about what I did in specific moments .
In fact , here you see the state of the demo that I 've just presented .
I can see other things that I 've seen in a day .
If I want to do a step back , and see everything I can do to pieces my history or history of my research .
So , here I was a newspaper , I was looking for the Bing , here for Live Labs Pivot .
And I can zooming on on my web and simply simply remove from here .
One metaphor reuse a lot of times , and in every case the result is more than the sum of the som of the som of the som of data .
At the world , data is seen as a kind of sick .
It talks about subjects of information .
It talks about the data in the data .
And if we put it all over if we put the Web , if we put the Web subject instead of passing from one thing to another , can we get to go from many other things , and then we can see those structures that othertherwise would have hidden ?
And then instead of hear ourselves in the data we could really extract information .
Instead of the information , we can get out of knowledge .
And the knowledge of knowledge .
And with this thank you .
So , these days of happiness .
I asked to content the number of books the word " happiness " happiness " in the title and published in the last five years , have stopped to content after they had restopped , and there were many more .
There 's an enormous interest about happiness , between the researchers .
There is very coaching about happiness .
Everybody would like to make people more happy .
But despite all this flow of work , there 's a series of cognitive traps that somehow make impossible to process ideas that make impossible to process ideas in happiness .
My talk is going to especially about these cognitive traps .
And it 's about people profad happiness , and it 's about studying happiness , and it 's about studies of happiness , because it turns out that we 're confused like all the others .
The first of these traps is reforming complexity to admit complexity .
It turns out that the word happy is not a word as a word as a word as we look at the field .
I think that you can reach it to a particular meaning , but in massize , we 're going to deal with this accept , and we 're going to have to deal of this accept , and we 're going to have to be .
The second trappy is the confusion between experience and memory : it 's basically about choose between being happy in life and be happy of their life or happy , or happy about their life or happy .
And these are two extremely different concept , both of the concept of happiness .
And the third is the illusion of the unfortunate unlucky that we can 't think about any circumstance on the well-being without the importance .
I mean , it 's about a cognitive trappola .
and there 's no way to do the right thing .
I 'd like to start with an example of a person , after a person , after a session of questions and answers , after a lecture of the lecture .
[ unclear ] Disse that while he listen to an absolutely magnifies just at the end of the registration ,
And then I added , in a very emotional way , which had rounded the whole experience .
But it wasn 't true .
What it was rowing was the remember of experience .
He had lived the experience .
And he had listened for 20 minutes of the wonderful music .
but it didn 't happen because he remained with a certainly remember , and the remember was rounded .
What this episode tells us , in the bottom , is that we could think about ourselves and other people in terms of two . "
There 's a night that lives of experiences , lives in the present and knows the present , and it 's able to revive the past , but that basically has just the present .
This is about the evening experiences and what the doctor is going close to -- you know when the doctor asks , you know when the doctor asks now , when you touch this ? "
And then there 's the night you remember , " Is it is the " evening the doctors , and it concerns about the history of our life , and it 's that " what the doctor is , " How the doctor is that the doctor , you are heard in the last time ? "
or " Where did your journey in Albania ? " or something like that .
Those are two different entities , the night that it lives a experience and what if you remember , and confusion between the two is part of happiness .
The sis that remember , it 's a stories .
And this process starts with a fundamental answer of our reminds -- starting .
We don 't tell stories just when we decided to tell them .
Our memory telling us , which is , what it remains of our experiences is a story .
Let me start with an example .
This is an old study .
It brings the experiences of two patients during a sweeping procedure .
I 'm not going to stop . It 's not even sweeping at the day , but it was painful when this study was conduced in the ' 90s .
And I asked the patients to report their pain every 60 seconds .
And here 's the results for two patients .
Those are the results .
If you say , " Who have two more suffered than you ? "
It 's a very simple question .
Clearly , Patient B has more .
his coloncopy dured more and every minute of pain the patient of pain by the patient B has suffered at least as much .
But now there 's another question , " How do these patients think we have suffered ? "
and here 's the surprise : Over the Patient A had a remember of the longer of the Patient Bug .
The stories of coloning were different gives because a particularly of the procedure is the way in which term -- no one of these stories is particularly positive -- but one of the two is different -- one of the two is particularly worse .
And the worst is that where the pain was massive moment .
It 's a negative story .
How do I know ?
Why do we asked these people after colonscopy , and also at the distance of time , " How much negative was the experience , all considered ? "
and a result of a lot of worst long time for B , I remember .
So it 's a conflict of the sis that it lives the experiences and the sis that the reminds .
From the point of view is that it lives the experience , it 's clear that B has more .
So , what you could do for the patient A , and we effected experiments clinical experiments , and it was really done , and it could extend the colonscopy .
This is going to cause a little bit in the patient , but just a little bit less than before .
And doing this for a couple of minutes , the sis that it lives the experience of the Patient is going to be worse , and the sis that reminds the experiences of the Patient A has a better remember of his experience .
How do you call a story ?
And this is worth for the stories that are coming from the reminds that we invention . What it defines a story , is the change moments and the final moments and final .
The final is very , very important and , in this case , the final has dominated .
So , sis that it lives the experiences lives his life in a continued .
It 's moments in which experiences lives . And you wondering , what happens to these moments ?
And the answer is simple .
I 'm allowed to always say that most of the moments of our lives -- as I 've calculated them -- I mean , I mean , the present psychological present in about three seconds . So it means that in a month , we count about 600 million in a month of them , thousand .
Most of them are completely ignored by the sis that reminds .
And yet , somehow you have the feeling that the feeling that what happens in these moments of experience is our life .
It 's the limited resources that we 're spending as we are in this world .
And how to spend it , it looks like relevant , but it 's not the history that the sis that reminds us for us .
So we have a night that remind and a night that it lives experiences that are quite different .
The biggest difference between two is how to treat the time .
From the view of the sis that living experiences , if you go to the vacation , and the second week is fun as much as the first , then the vacation of two weeks is twice better than a week .
But this is not absolutely the way it works is that remind .
For the sis that remember , a two-week is vagely better than a week of vacation because there 's no new remember in address .
You don 't change the story .
And that way , the time is the critical variables distinguishing the sis that it lives the experiences .
The time has a limited impact on this story .
Well , the sis that remember the experiences is more than remember to remember and tell stories .
It 's actually the night that takes decisions because , if we consider a patient that has had , for example , two different doctors with two different doctors and it 's deciding what the two choices of choices , what he choices less negative , and that 's going to be the medical , and that 's going to be the doctor .
The sis that it lives the experiences has no voice in these choices .
In fact , we don 't choose between experiences , but between the reminds of those experiences .
And even when we think about our future , we don 't think about our future as experiences .
We think of our future as a memories .
And basically , you can consider this situation , like a tyranny of sis that reminds , and you can think about it , is that it 's reminds as if you turn the evening experiences through experiences of which , it doesn 't need .
I have a feeling that when we go into the vacation is often the case that , you 're going to go to the service of our sis that reminds .
And this is a little hard to justify .
Why do we consumption our memories ?
This is one of the explanations that comes to the predominium of the sis that remember .
When I think about that , I 'm in my mind in the Antarctica of a few years ago , which is one of the best vacation of my life , and I think relatively often as well .
And I 've probably spent to think about that trip three weeks , to say , 25 minutes in the last four years .
If I had ever opened the 600 photographs of the journey , I 'd spend another time . It 's a three weeks of trip that translated into the massive trip . It looks like this is a discrepance .
Well , I could be a little extremely extreme , in my apetion of reminds , but even if you have to do more than that , a genuine question .
Why do we have a weight to the memory of the heavy that we do experiences ?
Now , I want you to think about an experiment with thinking .
Imagine that during the next next vacation , you know that at the end of the vacation , all the photographs will be destroyed , and you 'll take a medicine for amnesia , so you don 't remember .
Weat the same time ? And if you could pick a differently , if you could pick a different vacation , you create a conflict between the two sks and you have to think about how to solve that conflict and actually is not so obvious , because , if you think in terms of time you 'll have a answer .
And if you think in terms of remember , you could get another answer .
Because we pick the vacation that we do , is a problem that we do , is a problem that put in front of choices .
The two brought two notions of happy .
There is actually two concepts of happiness that we can use , one for every night .
So you can ask : How does it happy the experience ?
And then you can ask , how much happy are the moments in the life of it 's life that lives the experiences ?
And it 's about -- happiness for moments is a complicated process .
What are the emotions that we can measure ?
And , by the way , we 're able to make a good idea of the happiness of the health of the happiness in time .
If you look at the happiness of the sis that remember , it 's a completely different thing .
It 's not about how happy a person living .
It 's about how you satisfied , or it 's the person when you think about his life .
It 's a very different idea .
Anybody can 't be able to distinguish these two notions , it 's not going to be able to create confusion in happiness , and I appeared to a group of students of well-being , which have a lot of students in happiness for a long term .
The difference between the happiness of the sis that it lives the experiences and satisfetime that recognized was recognized in the last few years , and it 's now of the efforts to measure the two separately , the Gallup institute , the Gallup has a sunder half a million people have been subposed to a global about what they think about their life and their experiences .
And they 've been other studies in this direction .
So in the last few years , we began to learn about two night .
And the biggest lesson that we 've learned , is that they 're very different .
You could know how much person is satisfied with their life , and anyway this doesn 't tell you about how happy to live life and the real life .
To give you an idea of correlation , is about 0.5 .
What does it mean that if you meet somebody , and he said , " oh , his father is 1,80 feet .
Well , you 'll know something about his height , but with a lot of uncertainty .
You 've always got a little uncertainty .
If I tell you that somebody thinks his life is at eight in a scale , you 're going to be very uncertain about how happy they are with their healing experiences .
So the correlation is low .
We have a knowledge about what control of satisfy .
We know that money is very important , the objects are very important .
We know that being happy means to be satisfied with the people that we like , spent time with the people that we like .
There are other pleasures , but these are the main ones .
So if you want to massive happiness of two sks , you 'll end up doing very different things .
The conclusion of what I said now is that we shouldn 't think about happiness as a well-being .
It 's two completely different ideas .
At , very quickly , another reason why we can 't think about linear to happiness is that we 're not going to be attention to the same things when we think about life , and when we think about life .
So , if you do the simple question about how happy is in California , you can 't get the correct response .
When you ask this question , you should be more happy in California , which in Ohio .
What happens is that when you think about life in California , you 're thinking about the contrast between California and other places , and for example , that comparison is about climate .
Well , it turns out that climate is not so important for the sis that it lives the experiences and it 's not very important for the sis that reflection that is what it decided how happy are people .
But because the sis that reflected is in charge , you could end -- some people could , at the end , finally , transfer to California .
And it 's interesting to verify what 's going to happen to California in the hope of being more happy .
Well , sis that it lives the experiences is not going to be happy .
We know .
But what 's going to happen . They 'll think about being happier , because when they think about it , they 'll remember how terrible was time in Ohio .
And they 're going to think about the right decision .
It 's very difficult to think of the well-being , and I think I 've given you the idea of how hard it is .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
Thank you very much .
When we were at the telephone couple of weeks ago , he mentioned me that a result that 's interesting result of the Gallup .
Is it something that it could sharing that we still have a few minutes ?
Daniel Kahneman : Yeah .
I think the most interesting result that we 've found in the Gallup is a number , which is a number , that we didn 't waiting absolutely .
We found that , with reference to the happy of the sis that it lives the experiences .
When we looked at a 60,000 dollars a year --
CA : 60,000 DK : 60,000 60,000 dollars a year , people are infelious , and they become progressively more infelicity , Al of that , we find a flat .
I mean , I 've seen lines .
Clearly , what 's going on is that money doesn 't buy the happiness of experience , but the lack of money , but the lack of money certainly , and we can measure that very , very , very , very clear .
In terms of the other sis that reminds , it 's all another story .
More money , the more happy six .
This is not regulations about emotion .
CA : But Danny , all the efforts of Americans are about life , freedom , research of happiness .
If people were seriously seriously this discovered , in basically what we 've created , for example , the politics on the tass and so on .
There 's a possibility that politicians , and the nation in general , can they take a discovery as that seriously and bring a public policy based on it ?
DK : You know , I think you recognize the role of happiness in the public politics .
The presents of consideration will be slow in the United States , there 's no doubt , but in the U.K. , is becoming reality , and in other states .
People are starting to recognize that they should think about happiness when they think about the public political .
It 's going to put a little , and the people are going to discussion if they want to study the experience of happiness or if they want to study the valuable of life for which we need to start to start this debate at the most .
As you realize happen , it takes different directions at seconds of how you think about it , depending on the experiences .
All this influences is going to be in the years that will be .
In the United States , they 're doing some of efforts to measure the experience of happiness .
And that , I think , it 's going to go to the next decade , perhaps two , national statistics .
CA : Well , it seems to me that this argument will be , or at least should be , the discussion of more interesting politics to follow in the next few years .
Thank you very much for invential economy .
Thank you Danny Kahneman .
I 'm going to talk about energy and climate .
And it seems to look strange , because in my work at the foundation of vaccines and seed , things to invent the world to help the two billion people to live lives .
But the climate and energy , in fact , they 're extremely important for these people , are more important for each other in the world .
A climate means , for many years , loss of collected .
It will happen too .
The things are going to change in ways that the fragile environment can 't sustain .
Which leads to the hunger . At the conflict .
So climate field , they 'll be for terrible .
Even the cost of energy is , for them .
In fact , if you could lower the price of one thing , to reduce the poverty , to reduce poverty .
The price of the energy is down in time .
And a green civilization processing through the progress in energy field .
The coal revolution has powered that industrial .
And also in the 20th century , we assisted at a quick decline in the price of electricity , which explains because we have refrigertionators , we can create modern materials and so many things .
In the rich world , so , we 're as much as the electricity in a situation .
But as the price goes down , for example of half , we have to respect a new viniculation of CO2 emissions .
CO2 is warming the planet , and his equation is very simple .
CO2 emsexed a increase of temperatures , which is very negative effects .
The climate and , perhaps even worse , indeed , in the sense that natural , in the sense that natural ecosystems can 't achieve these rapid changes .
The valuation of how increase temperature because of a CO2 data increase increase , and like one of the two things , which is uncertainly , but it 's not very .
And there 's certainty uncertainty about how negative will be effectively .
So , I often asked the best scientists : we have to really reduce emissions ?
We can 't just reduce half or a quarter ?
And the answer is that , until we don 't get out of zero , the temperature will continue to go up .
It 's a great challenge , so .
It 's not like to say , " Let 's spend a 3.5 feet . "
It 's not a little bit of it .
It 's about the zero .
Now , we emit a lot of CO2 every year , over 26 billion tons .
About 20 tons for every American .
For the poor of the poor countries , it 's less than a tons .
The world media is about about five tons of tons for capita .
And somehow , we have to make progress that quantity to bring that quantity to zero .
The emissions are constantly increased .
Just a few economic changes have changed this tendency , so we have to go from increasing rapidly .
This equation has four factors .
It 's a series of multiply .
We have the amount on the left , the CO2 , which has to be opened , and the factors on the right is the population , the services that in average of each person , the media required by each person , the media required to each other .
Let 's go and see a factor , and we see how we can achieve it .
Probably , one of these numbers must have lower sses .
It 's algebra of high school .
Let 's see a little bit .
The first factor is population .
The world has today 6.8 billion people today .
Let 's get to the nine billion .
If we do a good job with the new vaccines , health , health reproductive health , we can decreasurements of 10 , 15 , but here recorded a 30 percent .
The second factor are the services that we use .
It understanding all , the food we eat , the vestion , the TV , the warming .
They 're desire things , and liberation of poverty means to provide these services for almost everybody in the world .
And it 's a good thing that this number increasing thing .
In the rich world , in the richer billion , we could probably save and use less , but in average , every year , this number is going to be able to save .
And so , complexively , the amount of services were more double than double .
This is a very simple example of service .
You have the illumination in your house , to do the tasks , but these kids don 't , so they go and read their tasks underneats .
At at the efficiency -- and , energy for units of service -- here finally , there 's good news .
This factor is not increasing .
Thank you so much of inventions , new ways of lighting , new ways of lightening , constructions that are realized , a lot of services you can decrease of the energy consumed .
In some services you can reduce 90 percent .
There are others services , like the fertilizers , or the airplane , where the margins of improvements are very , very inferiors .
So , complexiously , in the best energy consumed can be reduced by three to maybe six times .
But these early three factors reduce emissions from 26 to the best cases , maybe 13 billion tons .
It 's not enough .
Let 's look at the fourth factor , the key factor , the quantity of CO2 emitting energy .
The question is , can we reduce ?
If you burn coal , no .
If you burn gas , no .
Almost all of the ways to produce today the electricity , part of the renewable of nuclear and nuclear emed CO2 .
So what we 're going to do on global scale , it 's create a new system .
And we need the energy miracles .
Compl term " miracle , I don 't mean something impossible .
The microprocessor is a miracle .
Internet , and his services , I 'm a miracle .
People today have participated at the creation of a lot of miracles .
It 's usually we don 't have a scaddress , a date within the miracle .
It 's usually , it 's at the window , and something else .
In this case instead , we need to drive all speed , and make a miracle in very records .
I asked me : how to illustrate this concept ?
Is there a natural example , some exhibition that captured the imagination of people ?
And I was thinking about a year ago , when I brought mosquitoes , and people found it fun .
I ress them in the world , there are people who live with mosquitoes .
This is my idea for energy .
I decided that we want to fly lights would be this year my contribute to the environment .
That 's here .
They 're telling me that not points , they might not get out of the boat .
Now , we can inventing tricks like this , but they 're not going to be helping .
We need solutions , a lot of a lot of things that are , that it works on big scale , and although it was exploring in a lot of directions , I think just about five of the very important effectively effect .
I 'm going to get the brands , geothermal fusion , the nuclear fusion , the nuclear fuels .
They might also give some contributed , and if they can do more than I , much better , but here I 'm really interested in this way that we have to work on each one of these five , and don 't give them one of these five , and don 't give anyone , as a hard , because all of these are hard challenges .
Let 's go for first the fossils of fossil fuels , coal or natural gas that is .
Here 's our task looks simple , but it 's not , and it 's not , and it 's captured , after the combustion , and the opening it , and hope that we can get it .
Today there are technologies that caught 60 percent of CO2 , but reaching 100 percent of CO2 , but reaching 100 percent of CO2 , it will be very difficult to where you conserving this CO2 .
The biggest issue is still that in the long period .
Who is going to go ?
Who is going to get something that 's literally billions of times more voluminous than any other kinds of rejected imaginable , like the nuclear ?
It 's an enormous volume .
So it 's a hard problem .
Another source would be the nuclear .
But the nuclear is three big problems .
The cost , especially in very regulate countries , it 's high .
The issue of safety , the feeling sure nothing that nothing can go wrong , despite the human workers , and that the combustiable is not used by human workers .
And how then manage the scories ?
It 's a lot of reduced concern , worries are so many .
People need to make sure .
Three problems very difficult , you could solve , and about what you should work .
The last three of five sources of five sources I have rags .
These are the people often defines " renewable . "
And to say the real , despite the great advantage of not a combustible combustible ,
The first is that the density of energy produced with these technologies is definitely inferior to that .
It 's " collecting energy , and therefore many square miles , of thousands of square thousands of square thousands of times .
And these sources are intermitter .
The sun doesn 't splends all the day , or all of the days , and not the wind suffy .
So , if you depends on these sources , you have to find a way of electric energy even when the source doesn 't produce .
The challenges attend us on the front of cost .
And the distribution .
For example , let 's say this energy source is at the end .
So not only need you to have the technology , but you also have to do the connected to the risks of the outside .
And finally , the problem of accumulation .
To stimate the size of the problem , I analyzed all kinds of batteries today , for any computers , telephones , computers , telephones , I confront with the quantity of electric energy use in the world , and I discovered that all the batteries now in production could be less than 10 minutes of that energy .
So we really need a big step aving , a lot of hundred times respect to the approaches now .
which is not impossible , but it 's not very simple .
This problem is manifests already when the sources " intermitting more , say , 20 or 30 percent of the energy consumed .
If you get those sources for the 100 percent , you need a battery of miracle .
But how do we have on this road ? What 's the right approach ?
Is it a Manhattan Project ? What could we solve the problem ?
A lot of companies , hundreds , hundreds of work .
We need at least percent people in each of these five sectors .
A lot of them , look at them , defining them , defining them , which is a good .
And I think here , in the TED group , many people are already working in these fields .
Bill Gross has different companies , which is a called eSolar , which is a big ealing technologies .
Vinod Khosla is investing in dozens of companies that are doing great things and they 're doing big , and I 'm giving my support to this .
Nathan Myhrvold Myhrvold , and I 're finding a company , it 's going to take you , follow the road of nuclear .
There are some innovations in the rate , nuclear nuclear , the liquid nuclear .
But from a lot of time , the sector is hurt , that there 's some good ideas around is not so surprising .
The Terrapower is that , instead of buranium , just part of the U235 percent of uranium , we decided to buranium , we decided to buranium , 99 percent of the U238 , 99 percent . It 's an idea .
For the truth of it , but it 's never been adequately tried if it would work or not , thank you to have a lot of modern supercomputers now you can do a simulation and see that yes , with the right materials , it seems to work .
And because it buranium 99 percent of the uranium cost , the structure of the cost cost of uranium .
It 's burn the scories , and they use as a combustible combustiable with the reactors of the reactors today , from the problem that they were , a resource resource .
It 's consume the uranium as it combustion . It 's sort of a dog .
It 's like a bunch of wood wood . It 's called the reactor reactor .
From the combustible problem is solved .
Here 's a picture of a place in Kentucky .
This is scared , 99 percent of the uranium , which has been taken the part of the now used as combustiable , and therefore it 's called uranium .
These are going to be energy to the United States for centuries .
And filtering the water , with a cheap process , there would be enough combustible for the rest of the life of this planet .
So , a lot of challenges us , but this is an example of the hundreds and hundreds of ideas that need to us .
How would we measure our progress ?
What should it content the patterns ?
The goal , and then we 're going to value , and then we value the intermeds .
You 've heard a lot of people talk about an 80 percent reduction for 2050 , it 's very important to do .
20 percent of it will be produced by poor countries , and from a little bit of agriculture .
So , hopefully , we 'll have solved the deforestation and production of the cement .
To get to 80 percent , so , the developed countries , including countries like China , have had to replace completely replace their electrical production .
The other question is , we 're doing this technology in emissions ?
We put it in practical countries ?
Are we spread it even elsewhere ?
It 's a very important thing .
It 's a key element of the package .
I 'm going to go back , what would look like to have a 2020 pays ?
Even that it should have the same two aspects .
We should implementing my efficiency to start getting reductions .
Let 's leave , the minor is going to be total quantity of CO2 , and so the temperature .
But the vote in this matter , doing things that are not great reductions , it has a weight only parks , or even slightly inferior the speed of innovation .
We need to pushing these progress all of speaking , and we can measure the speed of the number of companies .
A lot of good books have been written about it .
The Al Gore 's 's book , " and the David McKay , " The David McKay , " Sustainable Energy Without . "
And these books beyond the problem and they create a context in which to debate the debate because these things need a spread .
A lot of things have to be contemporary .
So , I have a wish , right .
A very concrete very concrete that we 'll invent technology necessary .
If I had to pick a only desire for the next 50 years , between : we could choose the president of the country , the realization of a vaccine , which is a vaccine , whose publishing this thing that half and not produce CO2 , you pick up this thing that half and not produces CO2 , you choose this last one .
And it would be the most impact with .
If this wish , you 're not going to do , the fracture of those who think of shorts and long-term , between the United States and China , between nations , and it will be terrible , and it will be terrible , and most of all , the life of those two billion people will be long-term .
So what do we have to do ?
So what I 'm inviting you to take the initiative and proceding ?
It 's necessary a lot of steing to research .
When countries get together in places like Copenhagen , they shouldn 't talk about CO2 .
They should also talk about the program of innovations , and we stupised how much rediences we 're going to do in these innovative approaches .
We need to incentives , tops on the CO2 , the cap and trads the cost of instruments .
We need to spread the message .
We need to make this rational dialogue and understandable , and it has to include the government .
It 's a wish wish , but I think realization .
Thank you .
Thank you .
Chris Anderson : Thank you .
Thank you very much more on Terrase .
First of all , you can give us an idea of the size of investment ?
Bill Gates : Realize the software , buying the software , assuming all of the great scientists , what we 've already did , requires of millions , and even when we 're going to have the materials in a reactor reactor , to be safe only about hundreds of millions .
The difficult thing is to build the reactor , finding billions of various authority , competent authority , the place in which is going to build the first exampled .
Once built the first , if it works like announced , it will be the eggs , because the cost , density of energy , are completely different from the nuclear nuclear that we know today .
CA : So , if I figure out , this implication , well underground construction , a vertical services of nuclear combustible , nuclear nuclear fuel .
Then the process starts to the bottom and progrey towards ?
BG : Right . The reactors today , they 're still retained , a lot of people who can not work , open continue , opening , things that come and they go .
It 's not good .
If the combustible is very cheap , and you can make it gave for 60 years , put it into all the complexity .
Restas there , burning for years , and then it ends up .
CA : A nuclear nuclear features .
BG : Yeah . Well , the rejected you can leave them there , and put them into another reactor and burn them .
And we 're going to start with the rejected already , now conserved in vesis , now conserved in the reactors .
They 'll be our first combustiable .
So what it was a problem of convenial reactors will be the fuel fuel of our , and the volume of reactors is going to be reality .
CA : But when you speak around the world of the potential of this technology , where you have more interest to its interest to his realization ?
BG : Well , there 's no place in particular , and there are all these interesting rules of transparency about everything that is nuclear , so we can reach a lot of interest .
Our staff was in Russia , India , China .
I just met the Segretary for Energy .
We 've talked about how this idea adapt to program .
They are optimistic . And Japanese and Japanese have done in this field .
It 's a variation about something that 's already done .
It 's a very quickly improvement , but it 's a quick reactor , that many countries have already built , so anybody has already built a quick reactor 's a good candidate is a good candidate .
CA : Yours , what are the odds and the probability that one thing of that you realize ?
BG : Well , for one of these projects at scale , that produces energy , which is not very , we 're talking about 20 years to design it .
It 's this sorts of the environmental models demonstrate .
Terrase , if it 's good , that 's not very little , it could easily satisfying this goal .
And now there are , luckily , dozens of companies in the sector , if the functional research works , if the function works , if the function are going to be herogical , they 're going to have a little bit of it .
And it 's better if many solutions have successes , because at that point you can get to a solutions of solutions .
It 's necessary that at least a success .
CA : Spearing of important innovations , this is the biggest that you know ?
BG : A energy revolution is the most important thing .
And it would be not without the environmental vine , but the environmental vinvolves really much more important .
In the nuclear of nuclear there are other innovators .
We don 't know their job as well as this , but one is the nuclear nuclear .
There 's a liquid reactor . It seems to do it , but maybe they say the same thing of us .
So , there are different , but the beautiful is that a spending molecule of a million times more energy of a molecule , and we say , coal , so , if you can get the negative aspects of the negative aspects , the potential , in terms of fact , in terms of fact about the environment and it 's almost one .
CA : And if it doesn 't work , what do we do ?
Couldn 't we have to start adopt out of emergency to try to keep the temperatures ?
BG : If you 're in that situation , it 's kind of like when you have eaten too , and you 're going to have a cardiac .
Where you go to that point ? Could you need a surgeon or something .
There 's a whole bunch of research on that geoengineering , which are various techniques that would slow down the warming .
It 's how to stick a insurance .
I hope you don 't need it .
Some people say that you shouldn 't even work at the policy because it could improve you , make it continue to eat because that much surgeon the surgeon will save you .
I don 't think it 's a disappoints , view the importance of the problem , but now in the world of the geoengineering geoengineering solutions in the case that the predict events , or the innovations coming later of the predict .
CA : Clima-sentence : if I had a sentence or two dir , how could you persuade them come back ?
BG : Well , purfortunately , there are different kinds of skeptics and the scientific arguments are very few .
Some people say that there 's a negative feedback to the clouds that died the effects of the warming effects .
I 'm very , very few things that you can only say that there 's one million of the fact that there 's one million truth , the main problem looks like AIDS .
A mistakes a mistake now and pay the consequences just later .
And so , when you 're pressed by thousand emergence , the idea of doing sacrifice that you see the results only after --
sacrifts for the sacrifts .
Actually , the relationship of IPPC isn 't necessarily the case , there 's people in the rich world looks at IPC and says , OK , it 's not then bad .
The fact is that under that uncertainty should spining ourselves to the action .
But my dream is that , if we can make it economically , and to respect the vincoins on CO2 , then the skeptics will say : OK , I wouldn 't matter CO2 , almost practices I would like it , but I would accepted it because it 's cheaper of previous technologies .
CA : It would be slightly answer to the Bjorn Lomborg 's reasoning , if you invest all your energies and try to solve the problem of CO2 , your others are going to be sacrified , will be sacrified , when there are better things to do ?
BG : Well , the spending effective and development --
Let 's say the U.S. should spend 10 billion in more than they do now is not so engineer .
It shouldn 't destinated resources to others .
The things that are very much money , and also people who are reasonable to be willing , are the funding of anti-economic solutions .
For me , it 's absolutely that .
At less you 're not going to finance the learning curve , they 're close to the point where it 's going to become very cheap , I think that the efforts are concentrated in technologies that have the potential of basis .
If the alternative was , we make the energy expensive , so that only the rich people can afford " , all the presents can afford , " all the presents can afford to pay the energy five times , without changing style .
The disaster would be for those two billion .
And Lomborg has review his positions .
Her argument is , " Why isn 't it discussion more than Ricerk and Switchment ? "
For his past again , you know , it 's a skeeps , but he realized that it 's a bunch enough group , and therefore it 's solve the question of the Ricerca and Switlument .
And it 's a question that I think it 's appropriate solve .
It 's amazing how little you investing in research and development .
CA : Well , I think it 's just about talking about most of the audience of the audience that I hope to see your wish to be reality . Thank you .
BG : Thank you .
I 'd like to share with you a discovered that I did a few months ago as I was writing a article for the Italian magazine .
I always have my dictionary of the syny of handed to every time I write something , but I had already finished the article and I realized that I have never in my life trying the word " disabled " to see what I was found .
Let me read the result .
" Disailed , " aggered , unuseful , unuseful , unuseful , rowed , unuseful , momatate , standing , switched , Indebate , impoverished , impowerful , impowered , handed , impoverty , handed , handed , handed , Senile , degree , handed , cut , cut , cut , handed out , unuseful and weak .
Contrary : In shape , strong .
I was reading this list to a friend , and at a friend , and at the beginning , it was so ridiculous , but as I read the word moving my voice , and I had to stop my voice , and I had to stop on the shock and the impact of these words have left me .
You know , we 're talking about naturally about my old dictionaries .
I 'm thinking , it 's going to be an old built , right .
But in fact , the buildings of the early 1980s .
when I was starting to schools , and I was training and learning what existed out of my family and things that there was relative to other children and the world around me .
and , in order to say that , thank God , I was not using the synnow .
I mean , from this explanation to this explanation seems that I was born in a world that you see somebody like one who has nothing positive in a way of them , when , I 'm done today , I 'm celebrated for the opportunity and adventure that my life has been process .
So , I immediately went to see , 2009 in the network , waiting me to find a without value .
This is the addition of description .
Unfortunately , it 's not much better .
I find the last two words under , almost in the words of the last two words under , " and they say , " So it 's not just about the words .
It 's what we believe about the people when we 're noting them with these words .
It 's about the values behind these words , and how we build these values .
Our language influence our thinking and our view of the world and how we see the other people .
In fact , many civilization , included that Greca and that Romana , and that Romana , it was more powerful , because to say the higher things .
So , what do we want to bring to exists , one person that 's limited , or a more force ?
So , casually doing something simple as well as a person , a child , we could put a child , we could put the shapes and throw on their force .
Don 't we want to open the doors for them ?
One person , who opened me the doctor , it was the doctor , I was the doctor in Wilmington , Delaware .
Her name is Dr. Pizzle .
ItaloAmerican , whose name was too difficult , it was too difficult to take for most of the Americans , so it became dopted .
And the dottor P was wearing always crazation and had a perfect lination to work with children .
I was practically whatever of the time that I 've gone in the hospital , with the exception of physions .
I had to do what they looked like infinite repetitions of exercise with these big elastic fases , you know , to help me build the legs .
And I hate these elastes more than anything .
I hate them , really , I have sick them .
And , you know , I had already to treat , like a five years , with Dr. P to try to get out of these exercise , Inuseful , unuseful .
And , one day , it came to one of my sitting stants and inesorable , these sitting .
And he said , " wow , Aimee , you 're a little girl so strong , I think I 'll go to break one of those fases .
" When you break it , I 'll give you 100 dollars . "
Now , clearly , it was just a small manufactured , to make me the exercise that I didn 't want to do the perspective of being the childhood , but , what he did did , it was to give a different form of a lot of a different way .
and turn it into an interesting experience for me .
And I 'm doming today , the entity of his vision , and the dichionate about me as a child , he redefined my vision of myself in a strong , poderous , poderous and atliterally to the future .
This is an example of how adults with positions of powering can challenge a child .
But , in the example of first with those definition definition of the synthy of the paronymous vocates , our language is not a chance to evolve to the reality that we all want , the possibility of an individual to see itself as aims .
Our language , it 's not been at the changes of our society , many of which have been created by technology .
Now , of course , from a medical view , my legs , the legs , the laser operations to the laser for view , ginoccurred to the people that are helping with their ability to cooperate with their skills , and move to the people to cooperate with their ability , and moving the ability that nature has immediately to identify people to identify to identify their own .
So , maybe the technology will be revealing us now more clearly what 's always been a truth , that each has something rare and poderful to our society , and the ability of human ability to adapt us is our greatest quality .
The ability of human ability to adapt , is something interesting , because people have always wanted to talk to me of insurnery , and I have to admit .
This phrase never went well , and I 've always feels , and I always feels in disconnected to people at this , and I think I 'm starting to understand why .
It 's underestimate in this phrase , unsource , it 's the idea that success , or happiness , is reemerging on the other side of a challenge without damage or seven of this experience , if my life in this experience , if my success in life was the ability is to the pressure of a life , or what people perceived as my disability .
But , in fact , we have changed , logically , from a challenge , by a challenge , physically or mind .
And I would suggest that is a good thing .
The avity is not a obstacle that we need to go to reach our life .
It 's part of our life .
And I tend to think that 's like my shadow .
So , sometimes you know , sometimes almost none , but it 's always with me .
And , of course , it 's not trying to decrease the impact , the weight of a person 's suffering .
There 's avails and the challenges in life , and it 's all real and relative to every single person , but the question is not if you 're going to have adversity or not , but as you go through .
So , our responsibility is not simply protect people to care from the heads , but to pay them to get them into the right way .
And we do a damage to our children when we make them feel that they 're not ready to adapt .
There 's a important difference and distinction between the medical objective , and the subjects of the society that you can see me or not .
And , in the truth of advice disability that I had to deal with is if the world ever thought that I could be descriped by those words .
In our desire to protect those that we love to protect those that we love damages a cold truth , or really , the designs of their life expectancy , we need to be safe , we need to be safe not to put the first morning in a wall morning in a wall that disability to somebody .
Maybe the existing model to just look at what 's wrong in you , and how to put it on it , it can stick more the subject that the disease itself .
In not treating a person in the complex , don 't make it understand the potentiality , we 're creating another natural disease addition to the natural suffering that already have .
We 're actually giving a vote to the value of a person in our community .
So we have to see through the disease and inside human capacity .
and , much more important , there 's a relativity between those insufficiences percepite and our great creativity .
So , it 's not about valuable , or negate , these numerous research as something we want to avoid or discover under the taph , but rather to find those opportunities in a cracked accident .
So , perhaps the idea that I want to explain is that there 's no thing like to sound an adversity , as it opening to it , to use a term of free , to use a free term , maybe also dancing with it .
And , maybe , if we look at an accident as a natural thing and useful , we 're less supplies from its presence .
This year , we celebrate the Charles Darwin , and it was 150 years ago , when I write on the evolution , Darwin , Darwin has illustrated , I think , the truth of the human character .
To say it in another way , it 's not the strong of the mirors that sound lives , and it 's not even more smarter , is the most smarter address .
The conflict is the genesis .
From the work of Darwin 's work , we can recognize that human ability to survive and developed is driven by the suffering of human spirit through the conflicts in transformation .
So , again , transformation , adaptation , is our greatest quality .
And , perhaps , until we don 't know what we 're doing .
Maybe this is what it gives us the adversity , it 's a sense of its own force .
So , we can take a regal .
We can , re-imagine adversity as something more difficult .
Maybe we can see it as a change .
The adversity is a change that we don 't even even even adapted .
I think the biggest adversity that we 've created is this idea of normality . Now , who is normal ?
There 's no normal . There 's a common , there 's a typical . There 's no normal .
And you 'd like to meet those grigies , if they exist ?
I don 't think .
If we change this paradigm from one about how to get the normality to one on the possibility , or potentiality , to be open a little bit more dangerous , we can understand the force of so many children , and inviting them with community .
The anthropologists teach us that what we , like humans , we always wanted for the members of our community is to be helping , to be able to contribute .
There 's an evidence that in the Olanda , 6,000 years ago , bring to the triumpures and subjects with graves , and , perhaps because of the experience and the survival of these people was the proof of community : they didn 't see this people like rates and value .
A few years ago , I was in a citizens , where I grew up in the north area of the Pennsylvania .
and I was standing in front of a points of points .
It was summer and address of cords .
I heard this guy , his voice behind me , " but it 's not Aimee Mullins . " And I took me , " and this is a half age . I didn 't have any idea of who was .
And I said , " Well , let 's sonosuses ? I don 't remind me ? I don 't remember , " He said , " But you don 't remember I met .
I mean , when we met us , when we met you 're doing to hire your mother . "
Oh , that guy .
And , it 's certainly , I was playing a camel .
And that was the Dr. Kean , a man that I had only known by the stories of my mother on that day , because , clear , typically , I came to the end of two weeks .
And therefore , the ostetratic of my mother went to vacation , so the man who made me hidden was a loud to my parents .
And , because I was born without the peron , and I had the feet in this foot , and I had to be the messaggered , and I had to be the messaggered , this sumessaggering the news .
He said , " I had to give this designed to the design designs that you 'd never walked , and that you would never have the kind of mobility that have the kind of mobility , and you gave me a good life , and you gave me a good life , and you gave me a good thing , and you gave me a good thing , which is that he told me that he told me , I was that he told me that he kept in my entire childhood , which I had won in the words , a word of the words , which I had won , in the words ,
that I had marched with the Girl Scout , you know , the Hallows Scout , I won my study , or all the sports of my studio , or all the sports of the sports of Hallows , and teaching students of his course , medicine of Hanemann and Hershey .
And it 's called this part of the course , the X , the potential of human will .
Not a designer can keep in the connection of how much pose can be and be determinant in the quality of a person 's life .
And the doctor Kean continued to explain and he said , " In my experience , unless you can 't be repeared , and even though it 's a bunch of support , if it 's just a little bit of support , if it 's just a little bit of it . "
You see , Dr. Kean has changed his opinion .
It understood that there 's a difference between a medical condition and what everybody can do with it .
And there 's been a change in my thinking during the years , in this , if you had asked me when I was 15 years , if I had traded the legs with legs with legs with legs with legs , and I wouldn 't have a second .
I was sitting that kind of normality at that time .
If you ask me today , I 'm not sure .
And it 's because of the experiences I had with them , not for the experiences that I had with them .
and , perhaps , the change in myself because I 've been exposed to the people who opened me .
You see , everything you need is a person that you need is a person that shows you the epiy of your potential , and you can give somebody the asking of their force , the spirit human spirit , it 's so recectural , if you can do it and open a door for somebody in a crucial , you 're educating in the best ways .
You 're teaching them to open the door .
In fact , the meaning exact of the word education is from the roots " extract " that means , pull out what is inside , to take the potential .
So again , what is the potential we want to pull out ?
There 's been a chance in the ' 60s in the 1960s , when they were passed by the middle schools .
It 's called " " " " " " " We call " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " " "
That 's separate students dependently by their vote .
And the students with the best voes have a longer program , and much better teachers , etc , they did it for a three-months of three months , Ai students with the insufficient had given given " optimate . " And they said they were good at .
And at the end of this period of three months , they were having the results at the level of optively . And , clearly , the sad answer about this study , and that press of the students who were said they were " insufficient they said they were " insufficient of three months .
The ones that were remaining in school , beyond the ones that I had left .
The crucial part of this study was that also the teachers were engaged .
The teachers didn 't know that it was doing this change .
And he was just told : These are the students from optimate and these are the ones with insufficient .
And so it 's how they began to teach them .
So , I think the real disability is to have a damaged spirit , and a damaged spirit doesn 't hope .
It doesn 't see the beauty .
It has no longer our natural , child curiosity and our innate capacity to imagine .
If instead , we can support the human spirit , to see the beauty in themselves and others , to be imaginative and others , as we 're using our correctly correctly .
When the spirit has these qualities , we can create new reality and new ways of being .
I 'd like to leave you with a poem from a poet poet lots of 1300 called Hafiz who made me know my friend . Jacques Dembodied .
and the poem is called " The god that knows four words " " Every child known God , not the God of the names , not the God of the names , but the God that only knows four words and keeps , by saying , I live with me .
Thank you .
